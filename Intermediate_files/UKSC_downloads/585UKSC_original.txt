</span>This judgment is in two parts. One part considers whether this Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal. This is a question of United Kingdom law,
depending upon the meaning of an “EEA decision” in regulation 2(1) of the
Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) (“the 2006
Regulations”) which transposed Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC on
the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside
freely within the territory of the member states (“the Citizens Directive”)
into UK law. Logically this question should come first. But as we have
concluded that we do have jurisdiction, it will be simpler and clearer to
explain our reasoning after we have considered the substantive issues in the
case. These are questions of European Union law. Briefly, they concern the
position under the Directive of a child who is a third country national but has
been placed in the legal guardianship of European Union citizens under the
Islamic “kefalah” system in her own country.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">We doubt whether this regulation accurately transposed article
3.2 of the Directive in at least two respects. First, it imposed (and still imposes)
a requirement that the dependant or member of the household be a “relative” of
the EEA national. Second, it required that they both live or have lived in the

November 2012 by the deletion of the words “in which the EEA national also

been complied with. These require, inter alia, an assessment by a UK adoption
agency of the suitability of the adopters to adopt. This does not apply to
adoptions under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation
in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (1993) (“the Hague Convention”),
implemented in UK law by the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, because
these children are protected by the safeguards in the Convention itself. In
particular, article 4 requires that the state of origin should have determined
that the child is adoptable; that an inter-country adoption is in the child’s
best interests; that the required consents have been given freely and with
proper information and counselling; and that consideration has been given to
the child’s own wishes and opinions, having regard to his age and degree of
maturity, and his consent given where required.</span></a></p><a name="para8">

order made in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man; (c) an adoption effected
under the law of a Hague Convention country outside the British Islands and
certified as having complied with the Convention requirements; (d) an “overseas

</span></a></span><a name="para11"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant, whom I shall call
Susana, was born in Algeria on 27 June 2010, so is now seven years old. She is
a national of Algeria. Her male guardian, Mr M, is a French national of
Algerian origin who has a permanent right of residence in the United Kingdom.
Her female guardian, Mrs M, is a French national by birth. They married here in
2001. Finding themselves unable to conceive naturally, in 2009 they travelled
to Algeria to be assessed as to their suitability to become guardians under the
kefalah system. The First-tier Tribunal judge found that this was “a choice
they made having learned that it was easier to obtain custody of a child in
Algeria than it would be in the United Kingdom” (para 35).</span></a></p><a name="para11">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Having been assessed as suitable,
in a process described by the judge as “limited”, they were informed in June
2010 that Susana had been abandoned after her birth. They applied to become her
guardians. There was then a three-month waiting period, during which under
Algerian law the birth parents were able to reclaim the child. On 28 September
2010, the Algerian Ministry of National Solidarity and Family in the province
of Tizi Ouzou made a decree placing Susana, then aged three months, under their
guardianship. On 22 March 2011, a legal custody deed was issued, having regard
to the opinion of the public prosecutor, awarding them legal custody of Susana
and transferring parental responsibility to them under Algerian law. The deed
requires them:</span></a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“to give an Islamic education to
the child put into his custody, keep her fit physically and morally, supplying
her needs, looking after her teaching, treating her like natural parents,
protect her, defend her before judicial instances, assume civil responsibility
for detrimental acts.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The deed also authorises them to get family
allowances, subsidies and indemnities duly claimable, to sign all
administrative and travel documents, and to travel with Susana outside Algeria.
On 3 May 2011, the Court of Tizi Ouzou issued an order that Susana’s surname as
it appears on her birth certificate be changed to that of Mr and Mrs M.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In October 2011, Mr M left Algeria
and returned to the United Kingdom to resume his employment here as a chef. Mrs
M remained in Algeria with Susana. In January 2012, Susana applied for a visa
to visit the United Kingdom, which was refused. In May 2012, she applied for
entry clearance as the adopted child of an EEA national under regulation 12(1),
or alternatively 12(2) of the 2006 Regulations. The ECO refused this on the
basis (i) that as Algeria was not a party to the 1993 Hague Convention on
Intercountry Adoption and was not named in the Adoption (Designation of
Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973 then in force, the Algerian guardianship was not
recognised as an adoption in UK law; and (ii) no application had been made
under section 83 of the 2002 Act for intercountry adoption.</span></a></p><a name="para13">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The First-tier Tribunal dismissed
Susana’s appeal. The judge held that she did not qualify as either a legal or a
de facto adopted child under the Immigration Rules, nor did she fall within the
definitions of “family member”, “extended family member” or adopted child of an
EEA national under the 2006 Regulations. On her appeal, the Upper Tribunal
upheld the decision that she was not a “family member” under regulation 7 of
the 2006 Regulations. However, it allowed her appeal on the basis that she did
fall within the definition of “extended family member” under regulation 8. The
case was therefore returned to the Secretary of State for her to exercise the
discretion conferred upon her by regulation 12(2)(c).</span></a></p><a name="para14">

observed that the real question was not whether Susana fell within the
definition of “family member” in regulation 7 or the definition of “extended
family member” in regulation 8. Rather, it was whether she was a “direct descendant”
within the definition of “family member” in article 2.2(c) of the Citizens
Directive; or alternatively whether she fell within “any other family members,
…, who, in the country from which they have come, are dependants or members of
the household of the Union citizen having the primary right of residence …” in
article 3.2(a). The court held that the Directive permitted Member States to
restrict the forms of adoption which they would recognise for the purpose of article
2.2(c). Not having been adopted in a manner recognised by UK law, Susana could
not fall within that article; and that being so, those restrictions could not
be undermined by recognising that she might fall within article 3.2(a).</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para16"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This Court gave permission to
appeal, initially only on the issues relating to article 3.2(a) of the Citizens
Directive and regulation 8. However, in the course of the hearing before us on
23 March 2017, it emerged that there might also be issues relating to article
2.2(c) and regulation 7 which this Court should consider. The hearing was
therefore adjourned for written submissions relating to those issues, as well
as to the issue of jurisdiction which had been mentioned for the first time by
the Secretary of State in her written case. After the adjournment, Coram
Children’s Legal Centre (CCLC) and the Advice on Individual Rights in Europe (AIRE)
Centre applied for and were given permission to intervene on both issues. In
the light of written submissions from them and from the appellant, the court
granted formal permission to appeal in relation to article 2.2(c) on 26 July
2017. Once the Secretary of State’s submissions on that issue had been received
in October 2017, a further hearing was arranged for 29 November 2017.</span></a></p><a name="para16">

</span>This Court has little doubt that Susana would fall within article 3.2(a)
if she does not fall within article 2.2(c). The 2006 Regulations have caused
confusion by introducing the word “relative” which nowhere appears in article
3.2(a). “Family member” is a wider term than “relative” as it is well capable
of including people who are not related by consanguinity or affinity. All that
is required is that the person (i) falls within the broad concept of “family
member”; (ii) was either a dependant or a member of the household of the Union citizen;
and (iii) that dependency or household membership was in the country from which
the person has or would come. A child for whom the Union citizen has parental
responsibility under the law of the child’s country of origin is clearly
capable of being regarded as a family member; Susana was both a dependant and a
member of the household of Mr and Mrs M; and this was in Algeria, the country
from which she would be coming to this country.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The obligation of the host member
state is to facilitate entry and residence in accordance with its national
legislation, to undertake an extensive examination of the personal
circumstances, and to justify any denial of entry and residence. UK legislation
relating to foreign adoptions is clearly relevant to that examination. A
refusal of entry and residence would, in principle, be justified if there were
reason to believe that the child was the victim of exploitation, abuse or
trafficking, or that the claims of the birth family had not been respected.</span></a></p><a name="para18">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">But the fact that the arrangements
did not comply in every respect with the stringent requirements of UK adoption
law would not be determinative. The Secretary of State and her officials are
required by section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to
discharge their functions in relation to immigration, asylum and nationality
“having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who
are in the United Kingdom”. This duty was imposed in the light of the UK’s
obligation under article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
the Child (1989) that “In all actions concerning children … the best interests
of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Under article 2.1 the rights
set out in the Convention are to be secured to children within the
jurisdiction, but the Secretary of State has made it clear that section 55 will
also be observed in relation to children applying to enter this jurisdiction.
The same obligation arises under article 24.2 of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union, which applies whenever a member state is
implementing EU law.</span></a></p><a name="para19">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In a case such as this, the need
to safeguard and promote children’s welfare would obviously encompass the need
to protect all children from the dangers of exploitation, abuse and
trafficking. But the best interests of the individual child must also be a
primary consideration. This would depend upon factors such as whether the child
had been abandoned by her birth family; whether if she had not been the subject
of a kefalah arrangement she would have continued to be brought up in an

authorities in her birth country; whether they had gone through all the
appropriate legal procedures in that country; their reasons for not going
through the appropriate procedures for intercountry adoption here; the cultural
and religious background of both the child and her guardians, including whether
adoption in the UK sense is compatible with their religious beliefs; how well
her guardians are fulfilling their legal obligations towards her; and perhaps
above all how well integrated she is into their family and household and how
close and beneficial their relationships are with one another.</span></a></p><a name="para20">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Firstly, there is the <i>Communication
from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on guidance for

the Directive, depending upon the strength of the ties in the particular case. There
is no restriction as to the degree of relatedness. National authorities may
request evidence of the claimed family relationship.” (Original emphasis.)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">On the face of it, this would clearly include a child

according to clearly established case law, the need for a uniform application
of European Union law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a
provision of European Union law which makes no express reference to the law of
the member states for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must
normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the
European Union: see <i>Ziolkowski v Land Berlin </i>(Joined Cases C-424/10 and
C-425/10) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C42410.html">[2012] Imm AR 421</a>, para 32 and the case law cited. Accordingly, if
the wording of a provision of Directive 2004/38 does not give any guidance as
to how the terms used in that provision are to be understood and does not
contain any reference to national laws as regards the meaning of those terms
either, those terms must be regarded, for the purpose of the application of
that Directive, as designating an autonomous concept of EU law which must be
interpreted in a uniform manner throughout the member states, by taking into
consideration, inter alia, the context in which the terms occur and the
purposes of the rules of which they form part: <i>Ziolkowski’s </i>case, paras
33 and 34 and the case law cited.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">There is nothing in article 2.2(c) to suggest that the
term “direct descendant” should be interpreted in accordance with the national
law of the host member state. This is in contrast with article 2.2(b), which
expressly relates the concept of registered partnership to the laws of the
member state where it was contracted and to the treatment of such a partnership
in the laws of the host member state. It would appear, therefore, that “direct
descendant” is an autonomous term in EU law which should be given a uniform
interpretation throughout the Union.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para26"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Thirdly, that view is supported by
the recent opinion of Advocate General Wathelet in <i>Coman v Inspectoratul General

point 32: that the word “spouse” in article 2(1)(a) must be given an autonomous
meaning and applies to a third country national of the same sex as the citizen
of the European Union to whom he or she is married.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, such a uniform interpretation would accord with the purpose of
the Directive. Again, as Advocate-General Bot reminded us in <i>Rahman’s </i>case,
at point 36, albeit in the context of article 3.2:</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the right to family
reunification is understood as the corollary of the right of free movement for
the Union citizen, based on the principle that the latter may be dissuaded from
moving from one member state to another if he cannot be accompanied by members
of his family. Family reunification thus enjoys indirect protection by reason
of the potential impairment of the effectiveness of Union citizenship.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">If some member states recognise “kefalah” children as
direct descendants but others do not, this clearly places barriers to free
movement for those European Union citizens who have such children. It also
discriminates against those who, for religious or cultural reasons, are unable
to accept the concept of adoption as it is understood in the UK and some other
European countries, that is, as the complete transfer of a child from one
family and lineage to another. On the other hand, the fact that the term
“direct descendant” may have an autonomous meaning does not necessarily entail
that it should have a broad meaning.</p>

</span>We therefore cannot consider it acte clair that a child in Susana’s
position is <i>not</i> to be regarded as a direct descendant of her guardians
for the purpose of article 2.2(c). At the same time, we are concerned that such
an interpretation could, in some cases, create opportunities for exploitation,
abuse and trafficking in children, which it was the object of the Hague
Convention to prevent and deter. We are also concerned that an automatic right
of entry for “kefalah” children might lead to some of them being placed in

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This article does not in terms state that it must be the
person seeking entry who has abused his or her rights. It may therefore be wide
enough to cater for a Union citizen who abuses the right of family

Statement of Facts and Issues agreed between the parties for the purpose of
this appeal. However, on 6 June 2016, the Upper Tribunal held, in <i>Sala v

refusal of a residence card to a person claiming to be an “extended family

took the view, however, that we could not proceed with the issue relating to article

exclude decisions relating to extended family members (indeed, one which was
added later, paragraph 26(2A), deals with the evidence which must be produced
by a person claiming to be in a durable relationship for the purpose of

decided that, because decisions concerning “extended family members” involve,
not only a determination as to whether a person falls within the definition of
extended family member, but also the exercise of a discretion whether to admit
or grant a residence card to that person, they did not concern that person’s
“entitlement” to either. The Tribunal acknowledged that the point was not an
easy one. It had long been assumed, both by appellants and by the Secretary of
State, that there was such an appeal. Both parties maintained that position
before the Tribunal: only an amicus appearing at the Tribunal’s request argued
the contrary. (Indeed, regulation 26 had been amended in 2012 to introduce
paragraph 26(2A), which made no sense if extended family members did not have a
right of appeal; but that could not change the meaning which the Regulations
already bore.) In the Tribunal’s view, the “natural and ordinary meaning” of
paragraph (b) in the definition of “EEA decision” did not cover the refusal of
a residence card (para 48) (which was the issue in that case).</span></a></p><a name="para36">

of State had refused to grant a residence card to the Pakistani nephew of a
German national. The arguments were wide-ranging, the Secretary of State now
contending that <i>Sala </i>was correct. Nevertheless, the principal point at
issue was whether the decision in question was one which “concerns … an
entitlement” to enter and be granted a residence card (para 42). In <i>Sala</i>,
the Upper Tribunal had proceeded on the basis that this meant an existing
entitlement (<i>Khan</i>, para 43). Both the appellant and the Secretary of
State had argued then<i> </i>that there was a two stage process: first the
factual decision whether the appellant fell within the definition of an
extended family member; and second the decision whether it was appropriate to
grant entry and a residence card; once granted, this would result in an
entitlement to enter and reside; hence the decision “concerns” that entitlement
because it “is relevant to or important to”, “relates to” or “is about” the
entitlement to a residence card (see para 24). Irwin LJ held that “a decision
which ‘concerns’ an entitlement appears to me naturally to include a decision
whether to grant such an entitlement” (para 45). Longmore LJ, agreeing, added
that, even where there was a discretion, it had to be exercised in accordance
with the correct legal principles: a litigant was entitled to a decision
exercised in that way (para 48). Sir Terence Etherton MR agreed with both
judgments. The decision in <i>Sala </i>was therefore overruled.</p>

of the 2006 Regulations as they stood at the date when this appeal was
launched, it is for the Secretary of State to persuade us that the Court of
Appeal was wrong to reach the conclusion that it did. That she has been unable
to do. On the contrary, in our view the Court of Appeal was clearly correct and
there is no need for us to rehearse the very wide-ranging arguments put before
them. Despite the breadth of the discretion in article 3.2 cases, there is
nevertheless a duty to facilitate entry, to make full enquiries and to justify
refusal. There will therefore be cases in which a refusal cannot be justified.
Such a person will be entitled to a family permit and thereafter to be treated
as a “family member”. As Lord Wilson pointed out in the course of argument,
jurisdiction cannot depend upon fine judgments as to the proportionality of
refusal. It also makes no practical sense in a case such as this, which turns
on whether the appellant has a present entitlement under article 2.2(c) or a potential
entitlement under article 3.2(a): on the Secretary of State’s present case and
in the light of our conclusions on article 3.2(a) above, Susana would have a
right of appeal to the tribunal in relation to her claims under article 2.2(c),
but would have to bring judicial review proceedings in relation to her claim
under article 3.2(a).</span></a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For completeness, it should be recorded that on 20 February 2017, in <i>Secretary
of State for the Home Department v Banger </i>(</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2017/125.html">[2017] UKUT 125</a>, unreported), a
differently constituted Upper Tribunal referred a number of questions
concerning the claim of the unmarried partner of a British national to the
Court of Justice of the European Union. Among those questions, in the light of <i>Sala</i>,
was this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Is a rule of national law which
precludes an appeal to a court or tribunal against a decision of the executive
refusing to issue a residence card to a person claiming to be an extended
family member compatible with the [Citizens] Directive?”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Despite the decision in <i>Khan</i>, that question is not
moot, as the 2006 Regulations have since been replaced by the Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052). These largely
reproduce the 2006 Regulations, as amended, but decisions to refuse to issue an
EEA family permit, a registration certificate or a residence card to an
extended family member have been expressly excluded from the definition of an
“EEA decision” in regulation 2(1).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></a></span><a name="para41"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">We understand that the oral
hearing in <i>Banger</i> took place in January 2018. The issue is whether the
procedural safeguards laid down in articles 15, 20 and 21 of the Directive
require a full merits appeal to a court or tribunal or whether they can be
satisfied by the UK’s procedure for judicial review of administrative action:
is that an effective remedy for this purpose? Given the conclusion we have
reached in this case, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further on
this issue. We shall await with interest the outcome of the reference in <i>Banger</i>.</span></a></p><a name="para41">
