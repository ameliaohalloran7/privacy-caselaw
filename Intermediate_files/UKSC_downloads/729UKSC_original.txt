<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On 22 September 2015, Bernadette Hilton was convicted at Belfast Magistrates’ court on her plea of guilty of three offences contrary to section 105A of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992. One of the offences related to her failure to notify the Social Security Agency of a change in her circumstance which would have affected her entitlement to claim Income Support. The other two offences involved the making of false statements in order to obtain Income Support.</a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following her conviction, Ms Hilton was committed to the Crown Court and that court was asked to make a confiscation order under section 156 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This application was heard by His Honour Judge Miller QC on 20 October 2016. It had been calculated that Ms Hilton had wrongly obtained a total sum of £16,517.59 as a result of her crimes. The judge assessed the benefit that she had gained to be that sum.</a></p><a name="para2"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only property held by Ms Hilton at the time of the hearing before Judge Miller was a house which was owned jointly with a former partner. She contended that the value of her half share in the property, after deduction of an outstanding mortgage was £10,263.50. The judge accepted that contention. He assessed the available amount as that sum and made a confiscation order in respect of it. Ms Hilton was ordered to pay that amount within three months. In default of its payment, it was directed that she serve six months’ imprisonment.</a></p><a name="para3"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms Hilton appealed. Although not included in her original grounds of appeal, before the Court of Appeal she argued that Judge Miller had failed to comply with the requirements of section 160A(2) of the 2002 Act because neither the co-owner nor the mortgagee had been given the opportunity to make representations about the making of the confiscation order. It transpired that neither Ms Hilton’s former partner nor the building society which was the mortgagee was aware of the criminal proceedings or the application for a confiscation order.</a></p><a name="para4"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The proceedings in the Court of Appeal</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deeny J in an extempore judgment gave the decision of the court (Gillen LJ, Deeny J and Keegan J) on 12 May 2017: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/nie/cases/NICA/2017/73.html">[2017] NICA 73</a>. The principal issue which concerned the court (and which is the only matter involved in the appeal before us) was in relation to the requirements of section 160A(2) of the 2002 Act and whether the judge’s order contravened those requirements. Two other matters were argued before the Court of Appeal, namely, whether a reduction in the amount to be recovered should have been made in order to reflect the costs of the sale of the property and whether article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) should have been taken into account at the time of the making of the confiscation order, as opposed to the making of an order for its enforcement. It is not necessary to say anything on either issue.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal decided that section 160A(2) required that, at the time of making a confiscation order, the Crown Court must give to anyone who is thought to hold or who, it is considered, may hold an interest in the property an opportunity to make representations on whether a confiscation order should be made and, if so, in what amount. Deeny J observed that the subsection had not been drawn to the attention of Judge Miller but, in any event, the failure to give Ms Hilton’s estranged partner and the building society the chance to make representations was “fatal to the decision of the judge” (para 7 of the Court of Appeal judgment).</a></p><a name="para6"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director of Public Prosecutions applied for permission to appeal to this court and for a certificate that a point of law of general public importance arose on the appeal. On 6 March 2018, the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal but certified the following points of law of general public importance:</a></p><a name="para7"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where property is held by the defendant and another person, in what circumstances is the court making a confiscation order required by section 160A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, in determining the available amount, to give that other person reasonable opportunity to make representations to it at the time the order is made?</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If section 160A does so require, does a failure to give that other such an opportunity render the confiscation order invalid?”</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The 2002 Act</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are - or, at least, there can be - two stages to confiscation proceedings: the first is the making of the confiscation order itself and the second the order securing its enforcement. The first stage is provided for in sections 156 to 163B. That stage is triggered in the manner described in section 156. The obligation to make an order arises once the conditions in subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied. These are fairly routine. The order must be made if a defendant has been convicted of an offence before the Crown Court or is committed to that court with a view to a confiscation order being made - subsection (2); and if the prosecutor asks for such an order to be made or the court believes it appropriate to make it - subsection (3). The relative ease with which these conditions can be satisfied suggests that it was envisaged that the <i>making </i>of a confiscation order (as opposed to its enforcement) should be straightforward, indeed quasi-automatic.</a></p><a name="para8">

The starting point is that the recoverable amount is an amount equal to the defendant’s benefit from the conduct concerned - subsection (1). But if the defendant shows that the available amount is less than the benefit obtained, the recoverable amount is duly adjusted - subsection (2). The available amount is defined in section 159 of the Act. For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to subsection (1)(a) of section 159 which stipulates that the recoverable amount is the total of the values (at the time the confiscation order is made) of all the free property then held by the defendant minus the total amount payable in pursuance of obligations which then have priority. It was by dint of the operation of section 157(2) in tandem with section 159(1)(a) that the recoverable amount in Ms Hilton’s case was found to be the sum which, it was considered, could be obtained from the sale of the property which she jointly owned. It is to be noted that section 159(1)(a) specifies that the recoverable amount is the total of the values of all the free property<i> then held by the defendant</i> minus the amount payable for debts which have priority. The emphasis is on property which the defendant holds. Section 227(3), which makes provision for determining a property’s value, again makes clear that it is the market value of the defendant’s interest in the property, rather than the overall value of the property which dictates the amount to be specified in the confiscation order.</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">A determination of the extent of the interest of the person subject to the confiscation order on the basis that no further representations may be made by third parties thus becomes immutable, unless there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal - section 181(4), (5) and (6).</p>

But it is also critical that that question be addressed with the two-stage process involved in the making of the order and securing its enforcement firmly in mind. Before turning to that, however, it should be recalled that making a determination as to the extent of a person’s interest which precludes later representations by third parties (as opposed to forming a preliminary view about that interest) is conditional on the court’s considering it appropriate to do so. Since section 160A(2) <i>requires </i>that the court should give to anyone who may be a person holding an interest in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to it, by definition, it could not be appropriate to make a determination affecting such a person’s interest without giving him or her that opportunity. Unless the Crown Court judge is confident that the third party’s interest will not be affected, he or she should not make a <i>determination</i> under section 160A(1) which effectively extinguishes the opportunity for third parties to make later representations. The judge is not prohibited, however, from forming a view as to the extent of the interest of the person subject to the confiscation order for the purpose of computing what is, in effect, a statutory debt - see <i>R v Ahmed (Mumtaz) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/2599.html">[2005] 1 WLR 122</a>, discussed below at para 19. This is particularly so because of the provisions relating to the quite distinct exercise involved in the realisation of the order or payment of the sum due and it is to those provisions that I now turn.</p>

It is in these terms:</a></p><a name="para15"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section applies if -</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a confiscation order is made,</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is to be noted that the exercise of the power under this section is dependent on a confiscation order having been made. This reflects the two-stage approach: the first the making of the confiscation order and the second the realisation or enforcement of that order. As the appellant submits, if the interests of third parties are not considered and disposed of at the confiscation stage, they must be dealt with at the enforcement stage. This is the effect of various provisions in section 199.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first relevant provision in section 199 is subsection (2). It provides that the court may confer on a receiver (appointed under subsection (1)) a number of powers in relation to the realisable property. These include the power to manage or otherwise deal with the property (subsection 2(b)) and the power to realise the property, in such manner as the court may specify (subsection 2(c)). Subsection (6) makes provision for the court’s power to order a person holding an interest in realisable property to make a payment to a receiver in respect of a beneficial interest held by the defendant and, on the payment being made, order the transfer, grant or extinguishment of any interest in the property.</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">unless it gives persons holding interests in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to it.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">This is important because the section was retained in the legislation, despite the introduction of section 160A. It can be safely assumed, therefore, that Parliament intended that the two-stage process of (i) the making of the confiscation order, and (ii) its enforcement or realisation at a later point should be preserved. Indeed, there can be no doubt about this because a new subsection 8B was introduced by the 2015 Act (c 9), sections 27, 88(3)(a) (SR 2015/190), regulation 3(1)(a). It provides:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Representations that a person is entitled to make by virtue of subsection (8) do not include representations that are inconsistent with a determination made under section 160A, unless -</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the person was not given a reasonable opportunity to make representations when the determination was made and has not appealed against the determination, or</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it appears to the court that there would be a serious risk of injustice to the person if the court was bound by the determination;</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">and the determination does not bind the court if paragraph (a) or (b) applies.”</p>

Third party representations are forbidden, subject to the qualifications in sub-paras (a) and (b), <i>if </i>a determination under section 160A has been made. If such a determination has not been made, however, there is no inhibition to the making of third-party representations. Put simply, section 160A does not purport to occupy the field. The opportunity to make representations at the enforcement stage continues to apply either because a determination under section 160A has not been made or because the conditions in section 199(8B) are met. The fundamental point is that, at the enforcement stage, third party rights may continue to be considered either because the Crown Court did not make a section 160A determination, or because it did so without affording a person with an interest in property the opportunity to make representations when the determination was made.</a></p><a name="para18">

At paras 11 and 12, he said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … The court is merely concerned with the arithmetic exercise of computing what is, in effect, a statutory debt.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different considerations, will, however arise if the debt is not met and the prosecution determine to take enforcement action, for example by obtaining an order for a receiver.

This was - and still may be - a computation exercise to decide how much the defendant has benefited from his or her criminal activity and to assess what assets they have that might be recoverable.

The crucial question to be determined in the present appeal is whether, and in what circumstances, that division of functions can still occur where there are third party interests at stake.</a></p><a name="para20">

The significance of this is explained in <i>Millington and Sutherland Williams on</i> <i>The Proceeds of Crime</i>,<i> </i>5th ed (2018), chapter 16, para 16.53:</a></p><a name="para21"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A confiscation order is an <i>in personam </i>order against the convicted defendant and not an <i>in rem </i>order against specific items of property. The consequence of this, prior to 1 June 2015, was that third parties who held an interest in realisable property did not have a right to be heard at the confiscation hearing in the Crown Court or to have counsel make representations to the court on their behalf. If the defendant wished the third party to be called as a witness on his behalf for the purpose of establishing the extent of his interest in realisable property, he could of course do so. Following the introduction of section 10A of POCA [in Northern Ireland section 160A] … the position has been modified.”</p>

In such circumstances, the confiscation stage of proceedings remains separate from the enforcement stage. In the present case, the Court of Appeal’s judgment is premised on the proposition that on every occasion that third party interests arise, the court must proceed under section 160A. The consequence of that approach would be that there would be an inevitable collapse of the traditional two stages into one hearing with all the panoply of investigation of the merits of the rights of third parties, such as a former partner and the building society in the present appeal. This would inevitably introduce a cumbersome procedure to the making of the confiscation order. Conventionally, as in the present instance, those with some interest in the property which might become available at the realisation stage, such as former partners and mortgagees, are not made parties to the application for a confiscation order. If, in every case where third party interests were potentially at stake, a full section 160A investigation had to be undertaken <i>at the stage of making the confiscation order</i>, the case would have to be adjourned; those with possible interests would have to be put on notice; and the making of a confiscation order would have to be postponed.</a></p><a name="para23">

The making of a confiscation order would no longer be straightforward, much less quasi-automatic (see para 8 above) if section 160A had to be applied in all its rigour in every case where third-party interests arose. The enactment of the section was designed to streamline the system, not to complicate it. In my view, its purpose was to combine the confiscation and enforcement stages in simple cases where there could be no sensible debate about how the confiscation order should be enforced. This conclusion is supported by consideration of academic commentary and case-law which predates the introduction of section 160A.</a></p><a name="para24">

The House of Lords emphasised the <i>in personam</i> nature of a confiscation order: “The order which it makes is an order which is directed against the defendant only, and it is simply an order for the payment of a sum of money. The question of realisation, if the exercise of powers by a receiver is needed in order to make good the order which the defendant is required to satisfy, is reserved for the High Court” (para 5). It was further emphasised that the structure of the 2002 Act reflected the engrained distinction between the courts’ criminal jurisdiction and their civil jurisdiction, and the “division of responsibility and function between the Crown Court exercising the criminal jurisdiction and the High Court exercising the civil jurisdiction. The criminal jurisdiction is concerned alone with what order to make under sections 1 to 4 of the Act.

It was not mentioned during the submissions that were made to the judge nor in the order of the court. The hearing of the application for a confiscation order was principally concerned with the relevance of the costs of the sale of the property to the calculation of the realisable amount. The possible significance of third-party interests was not referred to by any party. It seems likely that the judge was completely unaware of these. Section 160A has no bearing on this case, therefore, unless the judge was bound to make an order under its provisions. For the reasons that I have given, he was not.
