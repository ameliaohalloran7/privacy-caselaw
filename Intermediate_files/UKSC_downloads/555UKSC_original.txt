<p class="NewSpeech">LORD NEUBERGER: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom
Lord Clarke, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal raises the issue whether the daily vessel-operating expenses
of shipowners incurred while they were negotiating to reduce the ransom demands
of pirates should be allowed in general average - ie whether those expenses
should be shared proportionately between all those whose property and
entitlements were imperilled as a result of that seizure - or whether they must
be borne by the shipowner alone.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">General average and the York-Antwerp Rules</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>General average refers to the system of maritime law by which sacrifices
of property made, and loss and expenditure incurred, as a direct result of
actions taken for the purpose of preserving a common maritime adventure from
peril are rateably shared between all those whose property is at risk in the
adventure. The principle of rateable sharing of such losses between parties to
a maritime adventure appears to date back at least to the law of the Rhodians.
Having been adopted by the Romans, it passed on a customary basis into European
sea laws of the Middle Ages, and thence into modern European Codes. It appears
that the expression “general average” started to be used in English judgments
around the end of the 18th century and was first authoritatively discussed
judicially in this country by Lawrence J in <i>Birkley v Presgrave</i> (1801) 1
East 220, 228-229. It was first recognised statutorily in section 66 of the
Marine Insurance Act 1906.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The York-Antwerp Rules are an internationally agreed sets of rules, the
first set (under that name) propounded in 1877, since when they have gone
through a number of versions. The latest version was agreed in 2016. The Rules
are designed to achieve uniformity in ascertaining which losses fall within the
principle, in determining the method of calculating those losses, and in
deciding how they are to be shared. Although internationally agreed between
relevant expert and interested bodies, the Rules are not the subject of English
legislation or international convention, and they derive legal force only
through contractual incorporation. In the present case the 1974 version of the
Rules was contractually incorporated into the relevant carriage contract. I
will refer to that version as “the Rules”. The Rules are in English and French,
and for the most part I shall confine myself to the English version.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rules are introduced by a “Rule of Interpretation”, which states
that:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the adjustment of general average
the following lettered and numbered Rules shall apply to the exclusion of any
Law and Practice inconsistent therewith.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Except as provided by the numbered
Rules, general average shall be adjusted according to the lettered Rules.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The seven lettered Rules are shortly expressed and are
plainly intended to be of general application, whereas most of the 22 numbered
Rules are lengthier, a few of them much lengthier.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Three of the lettered Rules are of particular relevance to this appeal,
namely Rules A, C, and F. Rule A is in these terms:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is a general average act
when, and only when, any extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is intentionally
and reasonably made or incurred for the common safety for the purpose of
preserving from peril the property involved in a common maritime adventure.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Rule C provides:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Only such losses, damages or
expenses which are the direct consequence of the general average act shall be
allowed as general average.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Loss or damage sustained by the
ship or cargo through delay, whether on the voyage or subsequently, such as
demurrage, and any indirect loss whatsoever, such as loss of market, shall not
be admitted as general average.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Rule F states:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Any extra expense incurred in place
of another expense which would have been allowable as general average shall be
deemed to be general average and so allowed without regard to the saving, if
any, to other interests, but only up to the amount of the general average
expense avoided.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para1">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The numbered Rules play no part in these proceedings, save that some
reliance has been placed on Rule XI. That Rule is concerned with “Wages and
Maintenance of Crew and other expenses bearing up for and in a Port of Refuge
etc”, and is the second longest of the Rules. It provides among other things
for crew wages and maintenance to be recoverable in general average where Rule
XI applies.</a></p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The factual background</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 29 January 2009 the chemical carrier <i>MV Longchamp</i> (“the
vessel”) was transiting the Gulf of Aden on a voyage from Rafnes, Norway, to Go
Dau, Vietnam, laden with a cargo of 2,728.732 metric tons of Vinyl Chloride
Monomer in bulk (“the cargo”). </a><a name="para2">The cargo was carried under a bill
of lading dated 6 January 2009 which stated on its face that “General Average,
if any, shall be settled in accordance with the York-Antwerp Rules 1974”.</a></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At 06.40, seven heavily armed pirates boarded the vessel. The pirates
commanded the master to alter course towards the bay of Eyl, Somalia, where she
arrived and dropped anchor at 10.36 on 31 January 2009. </a><a name="para3">At 14.05
on 30 January 2009 a negotiator for the pirates boarded the vessel and demanded
a ransom of US$6m. The vessel’s owners (“the owners”) had meanwhile formed a
crisis management team who had set a target settlement figure of US$1.5m. On 2
February 2009 an initial offer of US$373,000 was put to the pirates. </a><a name="para4">Negotiations between the pirates’ negotiators and the owners’ crisis
management team continued over the following seven weeks with various offers
and counter-offers being made.</a></p>

</span>The average adjuster, Mr Robin Aggersbury of Stichling Hahn Hilbrich,
considered that the negotiation period expenses were allowable under Rule F on
the basis that they were incurred “during a negotiation period of about 51
days” which enabled “an amount of US$4,150,000 [to be] saved in the common
interest of all property owners concerned, which would otherwise have been
recoverable as per Rule A”. The 51-day period to which he referred was, as
explained above, from 30 January to 22 March 2009. The cargo was valued at
destination at US$787,186 and the value of the vessel was assessed at US$3,947,096;
so cargo interests were liable for 14.44% of the total general average
expenditure. Following publication of the adjustment, the cargo interests
requested and obtained a report (“the Report”) from the </a><a name="para20">Advisory
Committee of the Association of Average Adjusters</a>. The Report set out the
facts in considerable detail, and concluded, by a majority of four members to
one, that the negotiation period expenses did not fall within Rule F.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cargo interests had previously made payments on an account of
general average, but following the publication of the adjustment they issued
proceedings challenging (in accordance with the Report) the adjuster’s conclusion
that the negotiation period expenses fell within Rule F, and seeking an
appropriate repayment.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>The owners’ argument involves the following steps. First, it is rightly
common ground that the US$1.85m ransom paid to the pirates for the release of
the vessel was expenditure which was “a general average act” within Rule A.
Secondly, the negotiation period expenses claimed fell within the expression
“expense incurred” by the owners within Rule F. Thirdly, those expenses were
“incurred in place of another expense”, namely the US$4.15m saved as a result
of the negotiations. Fourthly, those expenses, being US$160,000, are less than
“the general average expense avoided”, namely the US$4.15m (and for the sake of
simplicity I will treat this as the saving, although the actual saving was
somewhat less by virtue of expenses such as those paid to Captain Ganz and
NYA). Fifthly, it follows from this that the negotiation period expenses are
properly allowable under Rule F.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="ParaHeading">It would not have been reasonable to accept the initial
ransom demand</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cargo interests’ first contention is based on the proposition that
it would not have been reasonable for the owners to have accepted the pirates’
initial ransom demand for US$6m. On that basis, it is said that a payment of US$6m
(or, more accurately, the saving of US$4.15m) would not have been “expenditure
… reasonably … incurred” within Rule A, and therefore cannot qualify as an
“expense which would have been allowable as general average” in Rule F. The judge
accepted that, in order to succeed in its claim under Rule F, the owners would
have to establish that it would have been reasonable for them to have accepted
the pirates’ initial demand, but decided that, in all the circumstances, it
would have been reasonable for the owners to have paid US$6m ransom. The Court
of Appeal agreed with the judge’s analysis of the legal position, and declined
to interfere with his conclusion that it would have been reasonable of the
owners to have met the pirates’ initial demand.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a difficult question whether the Court of Appeal ought to have
concluded that the judge was entitled to conclude that it would have been
reasonable for the ship-owner to have paid the pirates the US$6m which they
initially demanded. While an appellate court should be slow to interfere with a
trial judge’s finding of fact, this was not a finding of primary fact. And, at
least on the face of it, one would have thought that it would have required
very unusual circumstances for a ship-owner not to try and negotiate with
pirates who had made such a very high demand. Further, the evidence suggests
that no ship-owner accepted an initial demand made by Somali pirates and that
their demands were generally pitched on the basis that they would be
substantially reduced by negotiation. On the other hand, one must beware of the
perils of wisdom of hindsight, and it is right to bear in mind that there was a
wounded sailor on the vessel and that the cargo was perishable.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, it is not necessary to resolve this difficult issue, because
I do not consider that the judge or the Court of Appeal were correct in
assuming that the owners had to establish that it would have been reasonable to
accept the pirates’ initial demand in order to justify the contention that the
negotiation period expenses were allowable under Rule F. One does not need to
examine the wording of the Rules to appreciate that the assumption made by the
courts below would lead to very odd results, as explained by Hamblen LJ at
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 62 to 64. It would mean that, if a ship-owner incurs
an expense to avoid paying a reasonable sum, he can in principle recover under
Rule F, whereas if he incurs expense to avoid paying an unreasonable sum (ie a
larger sum), he cannot recover. The more obvious his duty to mitigate, and the
greater the likely benefits of such mitigation, the less likely he would be to
be able to recover. Such a state of affairs (apparently known to <i>cognoscenti</i>
as the “Hudson conundrum”, after the writer who first described it) would be a
remarkable result. Fortunately, examination of the wording of Rules A, C and F
shows that it does not arise.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where I part company with the judge and the Court of Appeal is in
relation to their view that the reference in Rule F to “another expense which
would have been allowable as general average” is to an expense whose quantum is
such that it would have qualified as a claim under Rule A. In my opinion, the
reference to an “expense which would have been allowable” is to an expense of a
nature which would have been allowable. First, the word “allowable” in Rule F
naturally takes one to Rule C, where the similar word “allowed” is used, rather
than Rule A, where there is no reference to anything being “allowed” (the same
point applies to the French version - “admissible” in Rule F and “admis” in
Rule C). Unlike Rule A, Rule C is concerned purely with the type of expense,
and not with quantum. Secondly, the opening part of Rule F is unlikely to be
concerned with quantum, as that is dealt with in the closing part, which
imposes a cap on a sum recoverable under Rule F, namely “only up to the amount
of the general average expense avoided”. Thirdly, the interpretation assumed in
the courts below imposes an unnecessary fetter on the allowability of an “extra
expense”, as there is already a reasonable fetter in the concluding part of
Rule F. Fourthly, the interpretation I favour produces an entirely rational
outcome: whenever an expense is incurred to avoid a sum of a type which would
be allowable, that expense would be allowable, but only to the extent that it
does not exceed the sum avoided.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Applying that reasoning to this
case, and subject to the discussion below as to the cargo interests’ other
arguments, the US$160,000 falls within Rule F. The US$160,000 was incurred in
order to avoid paying a US$6m ransom (or, more accurately, a ransom of around US$4m
more than the ransom actually paid), and as the ransom was an allowable expense
in principle, the US$160,000 therefore falls within Rule F, subject to the
appellant establishing that it would have been reasonable to have paid a ransom
of around US$2.4m (ie the ransom it did pay plus the US$160,000 together with
the further </span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">expenses such as those paid
to Captain Ganz and NYA)</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">. If the judge
was even arguably entitled to reach the conclusion that paying a US$6m ransom
was reasonable, it must have been reasonable to pay a ransom well under half
that figure.</span></a></p><a name="para20">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if the analysis in para 19 above were not right, I would have
reached the same conclusion. As pointed out by Lord Sumption in the course of
the argument, where an unreasonably high sum is expended, there would be no
reason not to hold that Rule F applied, albeit only to the extent of a
reasonable sum, on the basis that the greater includes the less. Thus, if (contrary
to the analysis in para 19 above), Rule F only applied where a sum was
reasonably incurred, and in this case the judge had concluded that the maximum
reasonable ransom would have been US$4m, then Rule F would have applied to US$4m
of the US$6m ransom.</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="ParaHeading">The reduction in ransom was not an alternative course of

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn then to the second contention raised by cargo interests, which
was the ground on which they succeeded in the Court of Appeal. That contention
is that the negotiation period expenses do not fall within Rule F, because the
payment of a reduced ransom of US$1.85m was not an “alternative course of
action” to the payment of the ransom originally demanded, namely US$6m: it was
merely a variant. This contention involves arguing that to trigger Rule F, it
is not enough for a claimant to incur expense in achieving a result which costs
less than what an allowable item would otherwise have cost: the expense must be
incurred to achieve a result which involves replacing that allowable item with
a different and cheaper item. As Lord Mance expressed it during the argument,
this argument involves saying that Rule F applies only where some means is
adopted to complete the adventure, and that means is different from that which
might normally be expected.</a></p><a name="para22">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The notion that Rule F is only engaged in a case where the claimant
achieves an “alternative course of action” in that sense was said by Hamblen LJ
at </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 38 to 40 to be supported by passages in the two
leading books in English on general average. In paras F.01 and F.29<i>, </i>the
editors of <i>Lowndes &amp; Rudolf, The Law of General Average and the
York-Antwerp Rules, </i>14th ed (2013)<i> </i>write:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As the name implies, substituted
expenses are the expenses incurred in respect of a course of action undertaken
as an alternative to - or in substitution for - the expense that would be
allowable as general average.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">For this rule to have any
application there must have been an alternative course which, if adopted, would
have involved expenditure which could properly be charged to general average.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In <i>Hudson &amp; Harvey, The York-Antwerp Rules: The
Principles and Practice of General Average Adjustment</i>, 3rd ed (2010), para
11.33, there is this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although Rule F is phrased in
terms which refer to the incurring of the expense, its application in practice
presupposes a choice between two (and sometimes more) different courses of

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not convinced that, as a matter of language, those passages support
the conclusion that Rule F can only be invoked when the claimant has taken an
“alternative course of action”, but I accept that the prevailing view among the
writers on the subject, and among those who work in the field, of general
average may well be as Hamblen LJ suggested. Thus, it certainly seems to have
been assumed to be the generally accepted position by Hoffmann LJ in his
striking dissenting judgment in <i>Marida Ltd v Oswal Steel (The Bijela)</i>
[1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 411, where, at p 423 he quotes with approval a passage
from the 11th ed (1990) of <i>Lowndes &amp; Rudolf </i>which is identical to
that quoted by Hamblen LJ from the 14th ed.</a></p><a name="para24">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the law cannot be decided by what is understood among writers
and practitioners in the relevant field (or even by views expressed by Hoffmann
LJ in a dissenting judgment, especially in a case where the point did not strictly
arise and does not appear to have been argued). Experience shows that in many
areas of practical and professional endeavour generally accepted points of
principle and practice, when tested in court, sometimes turn out to be
unsustainable. I accept that it may be right for a court to have regard to
practices which have developed and principles which have been adopted by
practitioners, but they cannot determine the outcome when the issue is
ultimately one of law. Further, as the opinions of the average adjuster and of the
majority of the Advisory Committee of the Association of Average Adjusters in
this case demonstrate, there is certainly no question of there being a
universal view on the issue.</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to the language of Rule F, I consider that this “alternative
course of action” contention goes nowhere. Even if one accepts that the “extra
expense” must involve an alternative course of action, it seems to me that the
owners’ claim satisfies that requirement. It appears to me that (ignoring other
sums for present purposes) the right analysis of the owners’ claim is that it
is for (i) US$1.85m under Rule A and (ii) US$160,000 under Rule F, on the basis
that (i) the US$1.85m, as a reasonable sum paid to ransom the vessel and the
cargo, is admittedly within Rule A, and (ii) the US$160,000, as negotiation
period expenses, represents “extra expense incurred in place of” the US$4.15m,
the amount by which the ransom was reduced. On that basis, as I see it, the
incurring of the US$160,000 did represent an alternative course of action, in
the sense that the cargo interests use that expression, from the payment of the
US$4.15m: the former involved incurring vessel-operating expenses whereas the
latter involved paying a ransom.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There is an alternative analysis
of the owners’ claim, which is that it should be treated as being for a single
sum of US$2.01m, namely the US$1.85m ransom actually paid plus the US$160,000
negotiation period expenses, under Rule F on the basis that this combined sum
was “extra expense incurred in place of” the US$6m originally demanded.
However, I do not see how that helps the cargo interests. Logically, their
argument on this basis should be that the US$1.85m is disallowable under Rule F
as it was not an alternative course of action from paying the originally
demanded US$6m ransom, but the negotiation period expenses are recoverable
under Rule F, as they did involve an “alternative course of action” - which is
precisely the opposite of the cargo interests’ actual case, and indeed a
nonsensical result.</span></a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the cargo interests’ second contention cannot simply be
based on the wording of Rule F. Their contention, as I see it, must be that the
expenses incurred in negotiating a reduction in the cost of an allowable item
do not fall within Rule F because the reduction in the cost of an allowable
item which would be paid for anyway, and which falls within Rule A, cannot be
within the scope of Rule F. I do not find it easy to see how one can get that
out of the words of Rule A or Rule F. I suppose that one could take the
analysis in para 27 above and argue that it works perfectly well where, as a
result of the negotiation, an “alternative course of action”, within the
restrictive use of that expression as urged by the cargo interests, was taken.
However, given the problem identified in para 27 above with such an approach
where the reduced sum is not such an “alternative course of action”, I am very
dubious whether the approach can be justified anyway.</a></p><a name="para28">

international arrangement, it is particularly inappropriate to adopt an
approach to their interpretation which involves reading in any words or
qualification. As already mentioned, it appears to me that, as a matter of
ordinary language, Rule F applies to the negotiation period expenses for the
reasons given in para 26 above. To imply some qualification such as the
requirement that those expenses must have been incurred so as to achieve an
“alternative course of action” appears to me to be very dangerous. In the same
way as an international convention or treaty, the Rules should be interpreted
by a United Kingdom court “unconstrained by technical rules of English law, or
by English legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation”, to

</span></a></span><a name="para30"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Quite apart from this, the cargo
interests’ second contention appears to me to lead to difficulties and
potential anomalies in practice. Thus, there would be difficulties about
deciding whether a particular variant was an “alternative course of action”.
Towage to destination, extra costs of arranging dry-docking with cargo on
board, overtime worked on repair or cargo operations (at least sometimes), and
(historically) air freight instead of sea freight for spare parts were examples
given by the respondents of “alternative courses of action” (mostly taken from <i>Lowndes
&amp; Rudolf</i>, op cit). But it is hard to see where the line is to be drawn.
The difficulties about deciding whether overtime payments qualify is plain from
reading <i>Lowndes &amp; Rudolf</i>, op cit, para F.25; in addition, overtime
payments are enhanced payments for the same work whose cost would have been
recoverable under Rule A in any event. And if air freight can qualify if it is
incurred instead of sea freight, it is hard to see much logic in disqualifying
sea freight at a lower rate negotiated with a new party on a different type of
vessel. Further, given that, on the cargo interests’ case, negotiation period
expenses could not be claimed if they were incurred as a result of negotiating
a reduction in the cost of repair with one shipyard, what would the position be
if the negotiations were with a competing shipyard and/or in respect of a novel
and different way of effecting the repairs?</span></a></p><a name="para30">

</span>It also appears to me to be somewhat inconsistent in terms of logic that
(as has been agreed between the parties in this case) the costs and expenses of
Captain Ganz and NYA are subject to general average whereas the negotiation
period expenses are not. It is clear that the costs and expenses claimed by and
paid to Captain Ganz and NYA included costs and expenses attributable to the
negotiations with the pirates (for instance, hotel bills for most of the 51-day
period). They can only be justified on the basis that they were referable to
the negotiations to reduce the ransom, in the sense that they were incurred
solely because of the negotiations taking place. Accordingly, if they are
claimable, it is hard to understand why the negotiation period expenses should
not also be claimable.</a></p><a name="para31">

Hamblen LJ suggested that there were a number of anomalies if the negotiation
period expenses were allowable. First, he mentioned the difficulty of
establishing that the expenses would not have been incurred even if the initial
demand for US$6m ransom had been accepted. I doubt that that problem would
arise in most cases where the vessel-operating costs are said to fall within
Rule F, and it may well arise in some cases where it would be common ground
that Rule F would apply. In any event, it is for the claimant in each case to
establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the delay caused by the
negotiation would not have occurred if there had been no negotiation. Secondly,
he said that, in a case such as this there could be no entitlement to claim
vessel-operating costs as Rule F expenses until a demand had been made. I
agree, but fail to see why it is an anomaly. Thirdly, Hamblen LJ pointed out
that, in the absence of a demand, eg if there were simply negotiations, it
might be hard to say when, or even whether, Rule F was engaged. I accept that
there may be ransom cases where it is hard to determine at what precise point
Rule F is engaged, but it would, I think, be a rare case where at some point
early in the negotiations the pirates did not come up with a figure. Anyway, I
suspect that point could apply to cases where Rule F is undoubtedly engaged.
Quite apart from that, I do not accept that the fact that there may be
difficulties for claimants in a few other ransom cases is a reason for holding
that Rule F is not engaged in this case. More broadly, if (as appears to me to
be appropriate) one views Rule F simply as entitling a claimant to claim in
respect of an expense successfully incurred for the purpose of mitigating a
loss, it seems to me that none of these points should give rise to concerns.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The cargo interests’ other arguments</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cargo interests’ third contention is that, in order to be
recoverable under Rule F, the negotiation period expenses must be shown to have
been consciously and intentionally incurred by the owners, and there was no
evidence that the owners or their agent had consciously decided to incur those
expenses in order to reduce the ransom payable to the pirates. Indeed, Hamblen
LJ said at </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, para 43 that “it does not appear that the owners
ever considered that they faced a choice” and that there was “no evidence to
suggest that they ever considered choosing between paying the ransom on demand
and paying a lesser sum following negotiation”. Accordingly, runs the argument,
the owners cannot recover under Rule F as they never made a conscious choice
between paying the US$6m ransom initially demanded by the pirates or
negotiating with the pirates.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not accept that contention. The question whether one expense has
been incurred “in place of another expense” must be assessed objectively. In
this case, it is clear (and must have been clear at the time) that negotiations
were (and would be) needed if the ransom was to be reduced, that such
negotiations took (and would take) time, and that the passage of time resulted
in the negotiation period expenses (and would result in expenses of that
nature) being incurred. As the negotiations resulted in the ransom being
reduced, it seems to me that, subject to any other argument, it must follow that
the expenses incurred as a result of those negotiations were incurred “in place
of” the US$4.15m saved (or that the expenses incurred plus the US$1.85m actual
ransom were incurred “in place of” the original US$6m ransom demand).</a></p><a name="para34">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The cargo interests further
contend that the negotiation period expenses were not “extra expense” within
the meaning of that word in Rule F. This contention is based on the proposition
that, in order to qualify as “extra expense”, an expense would have to be of a
nature which would not normally have been incurred in response to the peril
threatening the adventure. I can see no reason for giving the word “extra” such
a restrictive meaning. First, it is not its natural contextual meaning, which,
in my view, is simply an expense which would not otherwise have been incurred
(but for the saving of the “other expense”). Secondly, such a meaning is
supported by the contrast with the word “extraordinary” in Rule A. Thirdly,
such a restrictive meaning lies unhappily with the French equivalent adjective,
which is “supplémentaire”. I take some comfort from, but do not rely on, the
fact that the word “extra” in Rule F has now been replaced, in later versions
of the Rules, by the word “additional”.</span></a></p><a name="para35">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The cargo interests’ next
contention is that the delay which led to the negotiation period expenses may
well have occurred even if the owners had agreed to the pirates’ initial demand
of US$6m. For instance, if the owners had accepted the US$6m, the pirates may
have thought that they had pitched their initial demand too low, and would have
increased it, leading to further negotiations and consequent delay. That is of
course a possibility. However, it is inherent in the judge’s conclusion that he
considered it more likely than not that the vessel and cargo would have been
released promptly if the US$6m ransom demand had been accepted and paid. That
was the sort of finding (albeit an implied finding, but necessarily so, in his
conclusion) with which an appellate court should be very slow to interfere. And
in this case it appears to me that we should clearly not question it: it was an
eminently defensible finding. It is clear that a delay of some period would be
inevitable as a result of the negotiations, and it is clear that the 51 days
(between the initial demand of US$6m and the final agreement at US$1.85m) was
inevitable as a result of the negotiations; on the other hand, to put it at its
very lowest, it is not unlikely that none of the 51 days delay would have been
suffered if the US$6m demand had been met.</span></a></p><a name="para36">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="color:black">The cargo interests’ final contention
is that, as Rule C excludes from general average expenditure which is an
“indirect loss” including demurrage, and/or because Rule XI includes crew wages
and maintenance where it applies, the claim in the present case must fail. In
my opinion, there is nothing in that point. I accept that the negotiation
period expenses, if consequential on a general average act, would have fallen
within the exclusion in Rule C of loss sustained through delay, but I do not
accept that it follows that they must therefore fall outside Rule F. Rule C
applies to expenses and other sums claimed by way of general average as
consequences of a general average act (as defined by Rule A). It does not apply
to expenses covered by Rule F, which is concerned with sums which are expended
or lost in mitigating or avoiding the sums which would otherwise be claimable
as general average. By definition, sums recoverable under Rule F are not
themselves allowable in general average, but are alternatives to sums which
would be allowable. One can understand why, as a matter of policy, demurrage
and similar indirect liabilities are not recoverable as general average, but it
does not follow that such indirect liabilities should be irrecoverable if they
are expended in order to mitigate what would otherwise be a larger general
average claim.</span></a></p><a name="para37">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As for the cargo interests’ reliance on Rule XI, I find it hard to see
why the fact that vessel-operating expenses are specifically allowed in one
specific type of case, means that it should be presumed that they are excluded
from every other type of case. In any event, the Rules start by saying that the
lettered Rules apply save where the numbered Rules apply, and that makes it
particularly difficult to justify the notion that a specific allowance in a
numbered Rule should impliedly rule out such an allowance in a lettered Rule.
Indeed, I understood the cargo interests in this case to accept that
vessel-operating costs would be recoverable in a case where Rule F did apply (subject
to their Rule C argument considered in para 37 above), and that seems to be
consistent with what is said in the two books on general average to which I
have referred.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>The York-Antwerp Rules have a status in shipping law similar to that of
the Uniform Customs and Practices in the law relating to documentary credits. They
depend wholly on contractual incorporation for their binding force. But they
are designed to create a body of principle applicable internationally in a
uniform way, although incorporated in shipping agreements of different kinds,
governed by different laws. It will therefore rarely if ever be appropriate to
imply matter into them which is not apparent from the natural meaning of the
words, unless the implication is necessary to make them workable or
intelligible or to avoid absurdity. Rule F is simplicity itself. It provides
for the allowance of expenditure which is not allowable as general average
expenditure but has successfully mitigated expenditure or sacrifice which would
have been allowable as general average. The cost of maintaining the ship and
crew during a period of delay which would not have occurred but for the peril
but was necessary to enable the ransom to be reduced, is deemed to be general
average up to the amount of the reduction.</a></p><a name="para41">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I appreciate that the practice of most average adjusters has been to
disallow such expenditure. In the absence of a comprehensive body of case law
(general average rarely reaches the courts), adjusters have adopted a variety
of practices or rules of thumb to supplement the Rules. This is perhaps
inevitable, but such practices are not law and there is a tendency in this
field for them to lose sight of the basic concepts expressed in the Rules
themselves. I suspect that this particular practice has been influenced by the
second paragraph of Rule C and the limited scope of application of Rule XI. But
the second paragraph of Rule C serves to limit the permissible heads of general
average expenditure so as to exclude delay. There is no textual, indeed no
rational reason why it should be taken to limit the permissible heads of
expenditure which although not general average expenditure successfully
mitigates something else that is. As for Rule XI, like the other numbered
rules, that is a specific rule relating to ships entering a port or place of
refuge, which does not impinge upon the general principles set out in the
lettered rules, as applied to other situations.</a></p><a name="para42">

</span>Although a general average case was the origin of the English Commercial
Court, general average cases are few and far between. The correct resolution of
the present case has divided both general average practitioners and the courts,
and the number of issues raised has tended to multiply as the case has

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The core question is simple. Where a vessel with its cargo has been
seized by pirates, and the owners over a period succeed in negotiating down an
initial ransom demand, can the owners include in general average not merely the
ransom payment ultimately made, but also vessel and crew costs totalling US$160,213.95
incurred during the period of negotiation (“the negotiation period expenses”).
The vessel <i>MV Longchamp</i> was boarded by pirates at 06.40 hours on 29 January
2009. A ransom demand of US$6m was made by the pirates at 14.05 on 30 January
2009 and was rejected by the owners as “too high” on 31 January 2009. The
vessel had by then been taken to a position off Eyl on the coast of Somalia.
Thereafter, negotiations took place lasting until 18.25 on 22 March 2009, when
the pirates accepted the owners’ last offer of US$1.85m. The ransom was dropped
at sea off Eyl on 27 March and the vessel was released to proceed on her voyage
at 07.36 on 28 March 2009. The negotiation was in practice conducted by the owners.
The negotiation period to which the relevant expenses relate runs from 14.05 on
30 January to 08.25 on 22 March 2009.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The relevant bill of lading provided for any general average to be
adjusted according to the York-Antwerp Rules 1974. The ransom payment and the
costs of specialist negotiators are accepted as direct general average costs,
falling within Rule A of those Rules. The question is whether the negotiation
period expenses fall to be included in general average under Rule F, reading:</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Any extra expense incurred in
place of another expense which would have been allowable as general average
shall be deemed to be general average and so allowed without regard to the
saving, if any, to other interests, but only up to the amount of the general
average expense avoided.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The owners’ case is that: (i) if they had paid the US$6m ransom
initially demanded, that “would have been allowable as general average” within
the meaning of Rule F; (ii) instead of doing this, they entered into successful
negotiations; (iii) the resulting reduction in the ransom payable from US$6m to
US$1.85m avoided general average expense of US$4.15m; and (iv) the negotiation
period expenses totalling US$160,213.95 can and should be treated as an extra
expense incurred in place of the general average expense of US$4.15m avoided.</a></p><a name="para48">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before the deputy judge, Mr Stephen Hofmeyr QC [2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 76,
the focus was on point (i), whether the US$6m would, if paid, have been
allowable as general average. He held that it would have been. The Court of
Appeal agreed with the judge on this point. But it focused on a different
aspect, whether Rule F was in principle applicable when all that had occurred
was negotiation, in the event a long, rather than a short negotiation, but not
an alternative course of action by which expenditure different in kind was
incurred. In the Court of Appeal’s view, this was not a case of extra expense
being incurred “in place of” another expense, but a case where the owners had
no “real choice” or “true alternative” to pursue (per Hamblen LJ </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 51-53) and there was “only one course of action open … namely to
treat with the pirates … however long that might take” (per Sir Timothy Lloyd,
para 99).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have considerable sympathy with the Court of Appeal’s instinct that
Rule F was not designed with the present situation in mind. The classic
circumstances in which it is treated as applying are cases where there is one
obvious or natural course of action open to the owners following a general
average event, but there is also some different action, which might if taken
lead to a more generally beneficial outcome overall. This, it is common ground
that Rule F in the 1974 Rules embraces situations where, instead of undergoing
repairs in a port of refuge, the vessel is towed as is to destination, or the
cargo is forwarded on another vessel, or, where, instead of discharging cargo
in order to undertake dry-docking and repair, extra equipment is obtained to
enable dry-docking and repair without such discharging. In the Canadian case of
<i>Western Canada Steamship Co Ltd v Canadian Commercial Corp </i>[1960] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 313, decided in an era when sea transport was the norm, the cost of
airfreighting a new propeller shaft from Wales to Singapore was allowed on the
same basis. However, it is also clear that Rule F can apply in situations where
the general average expense avoided would have been allowable under one of the
numbered rules, setting out various specific situations in which various types
of vessel or crewing costs are in principle recoverable as general average.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In short, the focus of Rule F seems to me to have been correctly
identified by Hoffmann LJ in <i>Marida Ltd v Oswal Steel (The Bijela)</i>
[1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 411, 421, when he quoted with approval the then most
recent edition of <i>Lowndes &amp; Rudolf on General Average and the
York-Antwerp Rules</i> (11th ed (1990), p 144), as saying that the substituted
expenses must be:</a></p><a name="para51">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… an alternative to, or in
substitution for - what might prima facie be thought of as being the normal or
standard means of dealing with a given situation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Hoffmann LJ went on (p 422) to leave open the question
whether under Rule F “the course of conduct giving rise to the substituted
expense should have fallen outside the obligations contained in the contract of
affreightment” or whether it is “sufficient that the expenditure was a less
usual and more [sic] expensive way by which the owner complied with his
contractual obligation, eg to repair the ship”. He concluded by noting that “<i>Lowndes
&amp; Rudolf</i> suggest that expenditure of the latter kind could fall within
the Rule”, but that Rule F “certainly contemplates that there was a practical
alternative by which the adventure could have been completed”.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cargo interests conceded in their written case, and I am prepared
for present purposes to accept, that this does not exclude all possibility that
Rule F might cover a situation in which, by some unusual or non-standard step,
the owners are able to replace or reduce in amount an expense of one kind by
incurring a lesser expense of the same kind. It does not however seem to me
necessary to go even that far in the present case, since what is submitted is
that the owners have, by incurring negotiation period expenses, consisting of
vessel and crew costs, avoided a different kind of expense, namely extra ransom
costs.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is however clear on any view is that Rule F is not intended to
cover general average situations in which owners simply do what would in the
ordinary course be expected of them in the interests of the common adventure.
Where this is the position, the expenses incurred will be admissible, potentially,
as “the direct consequence of the general average act”, allowable as general
average under the first paragraph of Rule C, unless they are excluded as loss
or damage incurred through delay under the second paragraph of Rule C. One
qualification to this is however significant. Even if expenses would otherwise
be excluded as loss or damage incurred through delay, they may nevertheless be admitted
if they fall within one of the numbered heads. Rule XI(a) in particular covers
costs of crew and vessel’s fuel and stores during the prolongation of a voyage
occasioned by a vessel entering a port or place of refuge or returning to her
loading port or place in circumstances falling within Rule X(a). Rule XI(b)
covers, broadly, crew costs when a vessel has entered or been detained in any
port of place in consequence of, or for repairs following, a general average
event. It is unnecessary to examine the precise ambit of these provisions. What
matters is that they constitute very specific qualifications of the exclusion
by the second paragraph of Rule C of loss or damage through delay. There is no
equivalent qualification which could cover the present case. Hence the owners’
reliance on Rule F.</a></p><a name="para53">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to bring the case within Rule F, the owners have to show - and
the onus is on them both as a matter of general principle and specifically
under Rule E - that they incurred “extra expense”, that this was in place of
another expense and that that other expense would have been allowable as
general average; and, once they have done that, the extra expense is only
allowable up to the amount of the general average expense avoided. I have
little difficulty with accepting the negotiation period expenses as an extra
expense in the sense that they were over and above anything that would, taking
Mr Hofmeyr QC’s words ([2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 76, para 89), “ordinarily have been
incurred” on such a voyage. I have already covered what may have been
contemplated in Rule F by the use of the phrase “in place of another expense”.</a></p><a name="para54">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rule F only applies if the other expense “would have been allowable as
general average” and subject to the condition that the extra or substituted
expense is allowable “only up to the amount of the general average expense
avoided” by not incurring that other expense. Viewing Rule F as a whole, it is
clear that the owners must show that, had they incurred the other expense, the
costs it would have involved could validly have been treated as general average
- their right to include extra or substituted expenses as general average being
limited under Rule F by the extent to which the hypothetical other expense
could have been so treated. The last sentence of para 19 of Lord Neuberger’s
judgment accepts this. It seems therefore of only academic interest to debate
whether the same conclusion would flow from the words “would have been
allowable as general average” by themselves. For my part, however, I consider
that it would have done. The word “allowable” must take one back to the
requirements of Rule A as well as Rule C. Rule A apart, there would be no
indication what is meant by “general average” or an expense allowable in
general average. The onus placed under Rule E on any party claiming in general
average to show that the loss or expense claimed is “properly allowable as
general average” must carry one back to Rule A as well as C. In this
connection, it is also notable that the French word used throughout Rules C, E
and F (<i>admis</i>, <i>admise</i>, <i>admission</i> or <i>admissible</i>) has
in each case the same root.</a></p><a name="para55">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The “Hudson conundrum”, to which Lord Neuberger refers (para 18 above),
does not lead to any different conclusion. In most, if not all, circumstances
in which Rule F applies, there will be a prima facie or standard course of
action to be taken in the face of the general average event, but the owners
will, by adopting some unusual means, have arrived at an alternative solution
to further the common adventure. In such cases, the other paying parties will
be hard pressed to suggest that the prima facie or standard reaction would have
been unreasonable. There is a parallel here with the duty to mitigate, which is
not lightly to be imposed or treated as broken. The Court of Appeal (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 73-74) was in this respect right in my view to agree with the
deputy judge’s general conclusion of principle ([2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 73, para
77) that the hypothetical other expense must be one which would have been
reasonably incurred in a sense “interpreted and applied with a sufficient
degree of latitude to give rule F practical effect”. In many cases, the
differences between the two courses (the standard and that adopted) may not be
large, and both may easily be reconciled as reasonable reactions. Rule F is
also careful, by its concluding words, to recognise that the extra expense may
not be less than that which would have resulted from taking the standard
course. In such a case, Rule F performs the valuable function of allowing
recovery up to the amount which would have been recoverable had the standard
course been adopted.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning specifically to an unusual situation like the present: if there
is no course at all open to take, the expenses of which would have been
allowable as general average, then matters must run their course. If a ransom
is demanded and paid in an amount which is unreasonable to pay, the only amount
allowable in general average will be whatever lesser amount it would have been
reasonable, after negotiation, to pay. If the negotiation period expenses are
regarded as an extra expense incurred in place of the amount of the ransom
avoided by the negotiation, they can be recoverable at most only so far as the
negotiation avoided the making of a ransom payment which it would have been
reasonable to pay.</a></p><a name="para57">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On no view is there any basis for reading into the clear language of
Rule F an entirely artificial assumption that, when judging whether the other
expense would have been allowable as general average, the possibility of
incurring the extra expense in place of that other expense must be ignored. To
do so would be flatly contrary to the language and evident intent of Rule F.
The reasoning and decision of the House of Lords in <i>Marida Ltd v Oswal Steel
(The Bijela)</i> [1994] 1 WLR 615 turned on the very different wording of Rules
X(b) and XIV, under which the express assumption in Rule XIV that “such
[temporary] repairs had not been effected there” could be, and fell to be, read
into Rule X(b) when considering what repair expenses would have been necessary
and allowed in general average for the purposes of Rules X(b) and XIV, read
together.</a></p><a name="para58">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both the courts below have in this case concluded that it would have
been reasonable for the owners to accept and pay the first ransom demand of US$6m.
The Court of Appeal has however decided the case against the owners on the
basis that they faced no real choice but to negotiate, however long the
negotiation might take. There is to my mind a tension between the two strands
of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning. If it would have been reasonable to accept
and pay the first demand, then the owners were on the face of it taking a stand
by seeking an even more reasonable deal in the interests of all concerned in
the common adventure. It is not apparent that Rule F could not extend to such a
course, if, as here, it involved the owners in some expense in the form of
additional crew and vessel expenses.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But I find even more difficult the joint conclusion of both courts below
that it would have been reasonable for the owners to meet the first ransom
demand. The deputy judge found difficulty in seeing how any ransom payment
could be described as reasonable: [2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 76, para 98. He said:</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“At least in one sense, no ransom
payment could ever be described as ‘reasonable’. Pirates are criminals engaged
in extortion and their demands are unlawful and deplorable. How can a payment extorted
by pirates be described as ‘reasonable’? In my view, it cannot. The idea of a
‘reasonable ransom’ is radically misconceived and the term an oxymoron.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">That is however to look at the point from only one
direction. The relevant viewpoint is that of the unfortunate victims involved
in a common adventure. From their viewpoint, there must be some ransom demands
to which it is reasonable and others to which it is unreasonable to respond.
Even the deputy judge appeared prepared to accept that the latter would include
a ransom demand well in excess of the value of the vessel and cargo.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, this was as far as the deputy judge was prepared to go. Leaving
aside exceptional circumstances, where the value of the ransom demanded clearly
exceeded the value of the property involved in the venture, he thought it
obvious that it would not be reasonable to say that an owner under an
obligation to proceed with due despatch had not reasonably incurred a ransom
paid. He went on, at para 99:</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para61">“Even if it may be said that, by
January 2009, a pattern of dealing between Somali pirates and shipowners had
developed, as described by David Steel J in <i>Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate
Member Ltd (The Bunga Melati Dua)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/280.html">[2010] 2 All ER 593</a>’ <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/280.html">[2010] 1 Lloyd's Rep 509</a> at paras 19, 23, 25 and 26 (affirmed on appeal: [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 630;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/24.html">[2011] 1 WLR 2012</a>), such a pattern would not remove the potential for
unreasonable, irrational and illogical behaviour.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In support, the deputy judge said that negotiation was an
uncertain process and it “was not possible to state with reasonable certainty
when the ransom demand was made that the amount of the ransom would inevitably
be significantly reduced by the process of negotiation” (para 100). Whether or
not it is “possible to state with reasonable certainty” that a negotiation will
achieve significant success cannot however be the test of whether or not
negotiation should reasonably be essayed. The deputy judge also derived comfort
from his conclusion on this point from the consideration that “natural justice
requires that all should contribute to the substituted expenses incurred” (para
103). A difficulty about this observation is that nothing in Rule F could
enable cargo interests to recover any matching loss or damage that they might
suffer from the delay during negotiations. The cargo was in fact perishable,
even though in the event it survived the rigours it underwent without apparent
deterioration. As the Court of Appeal correctly recognised in this connection
(para 51), whether or not an item falls within general average depends on the
proper interpretation of the York-Antwerp Rules. They represent a balanced
framework, negotiated over time between all interests involved.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I have already observed, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning involves a
potential tension between the approaches taken to the scope of Rule F and to
the issue of the reasonableness of paying the initial ransom demand. In the
former context, Hamblen LJ said this </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 43-46:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some support for the cargo
interests’ approach is to be found in the evidence. Thus, it does not appear
that the owners ever considered that they faced a choice. The owners’ crisis
management and negotiation team were set up before any ransom demand had been
made. From the outset the goal was to negotiate to obtain release of the vessel
upon payment of a ransom, but in a reduced amount. There is no evidence to
suggest that they ever considered choosing between paying the ransom on demand
and paying a lesser sum following negotiation.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also borne out
by the advisory committee’s stated experience, which is that in all Somali
piracy cases the same course of action is taken, namely to negotiate and pay a
reduced ransom leading to release of the vessel. Again it does not appear that
there is considered to be a choice of payment on demand.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment this
failure to recognise that there is a choice reflects the reality, which is that
payment on demand is simply a different way of going about the same course of
action and not a true alternative course of action. Whether or not the ransom
is paid on demand there will still be a negotiation, there will still be delay,
there will still be the incurring of vessel and crew running costs during the
period of delay. In either case the same expenses will be incurred; the
difference is only in their extent.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, for
example, there was a period of delay between the hijacking and the first ransom
demand. Even if that first demand had been accepted, it does not follow that it
would have been agreed. As the majority of the advisory committee state, the
unprecedented acceptance of the ransom on demand may well have been ‘met by a
demand from the pirates for a still higher figure’. Even if that was not the
case, it would still have been necessary to negotiate and agree matters
relating to place and method of payment and to the release of vessel and crew.
Thus in this case it is to be noted that there was a period of six days between
the agreement of the ransom and the release of the vessel.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the latter context, however, Hamblen LJ said, at paras 77-84:</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“77.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cargo interests
contend that the judge was wrong to conclude that payment on demand would have
been reasonable and that account should have been taken (but was not) of the following
matters:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The established modus
operandi for Somali pirates as at the date of the hijacking, namely invariably
to negotiate down the amount of the ransom demanded over a period of time with
little or no risk to cargo or crew.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the experience of
the majority of the advisory committee, ‘the negotiation period is common in
all piracy cases’ and ‘there is always a period of negotiation before a vessel
is released and it is the normal means of dealing with such situations’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minority member
accepted that there was a reasonable period of ‘customary’ negotiation and that
‘clearly, the ransom amount initially demanded cannot automatically be allowed
in general average’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position adopted by
the owners in their skeleton argument at trial, ‘That is not to say that paying
the first-demanded ransom is ever likely in fact to be a reasonable course of
action. In reality, where there is the option of entering into negotiations
with pirates, it will almost always be the right thing to do’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They submit that if
proper regard is had to these matters it should be concluded that it would be
unreasonable to pay the originally demanded ransom without even attempting to
negotiate the amount of the ransom payment, contrary to the established practice,
and that the judge was wrong to conclude otherwise. They further submit that
payment on demand would be an ‘artificial invention’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owners do not accept
that there is satisfactory evidence to establish the matters sought to be
relied upon by the cargo interests, but that in any event they do not render
payment of the full ransom demand unreasonable.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owners accept that
the evidence at that time was that Somali pirates would release a vessel upon
payment of a ransom. As they point out, that being so, the sooner the ransom
was paid, the quicker the vessel would be released and the vessel, cargo and
crew removed from danger.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para63">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment, if, as
stated in the <i>Masefield</i> case </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/280.html">[2010] 2 All ER 593</a>, ‘the safest, most
timely and effective means to secure the release’ of a ship and crew was to pay
a ransom, it follows that the most safe, timely and effective means of so doing
is to pay as soon as possible. It may be that the general practice was to try
to negotiate the ransom down, but that does not mean that it would be
unreasonable to pay the ransom straight away so as to avert the very real
danger to vessel, cargo and crew as quickly and effectively as possible. Nor
can a course of action which procures such real and tangible benefits be regarded
as an ‘artificial invention’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in my judgment
the reasons given by the judge are all cogent and compelling reasons for
concluding that payment of the initial ransom sum would have been reasonable.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further reasons for
supporting that conclusion include the following:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of the delay
involved in seeking to negotiate a lower ransom is to keep the vessel, cargo
and crew in peril, with all the risks of saying ‘no’ to pirates, who are
violent, armed criminals.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vessel and cargo
were under the control of the pirates. As such, there were obvious dangers
should there be a storm or other peril of the sea.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owners knew that
there had been a firefight during the capture of the vessel and that a crew
member had been wounded.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although, as matters
turned out, the pirates’ main negotiator was said to be a ‘calm, rational
communicator’ who never resorted to threats or other coercive tactics, the
owners had no reason to assume that.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was just one of
many ‘known unknowns’ facing the owners.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all these reasons I
conclude that it cannot be shown that the judge was wrong to find that payment
of the initial ransom demand would have been reasonable. It follows that I
would dismiss the appeal on this issue.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">I note that, after the quotation from the <i>Masefield </i>case
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/280.html">[2010] 2 All ER 593</a> in para 81 of Hamblen LJ’s judgment, the words “to pay a
ransom” are not a correct citation. The actual words in the <i>Masefield</i>
judgment were “to negotiate and subsequently pay a ransom”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cargo interests rely on the apparent acceptance both by the deputy
judge ([2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 76, para 99, quoted in para 61 above) and by the
Court of Appeal (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/708.html">[2016] Bus LR 1285</a>, paras 43, 44, 46 and 81) of a general
practice to negotiate any ransom demand down over a period. The owners object
that there is no evidence justifying any such conclusion. But their own
skeleton argument for the trial stated that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This is not to say that paying
the first-demanded ransom is ever likely <i>in fact</i> to be a reasonable
course of action. In reality, where there is the option of entering into
negotiations with pirates, it will almost always be the right thing to do. But
when considering the allowability in GA of the costs of the negotiation, the
relevant alternative scenario to be considered is the one in which there is no
negotiation possible/available.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The last sentence reflects the owners’ then case, which
relied on a suggested analogy with the reasoning of the House of Lords in <i>The
Bijela</i>, discussed in para 58 above.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial in the present case was a Commercial Court trial on the
documents. It seems clear that the deputy judge treated himself as entitled to
rely on all the material before him when considering the factual position,
including the statements in the <i>Masefield </i>case and the Report of the
Advisory Committee of the Association of Average Adjusters on the present case,
which he summarised at some length, while recording that it was common ground
that it was not binding on the court. I see no reason to regard either the
deputy judge or the Court of Appeal as having erred in this respect. David
Steel J’s judgment in the <i>Masefield </i>case noted (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/280.html">[2010] 2 All ER 593</a>, para
14) that the initial ransom demand in that case of US$2m in August 2008</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“was all of a piece with the
process of Somali hijacking. Fortunately the process of negotiating such a
demand and making an agreed payment had invariably led to the release of all
vessels involved. Against that background, I did not understand it to be
controversial that the actual prospects of recovery of the cargo as at 18
September 2008 were good.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Other relevant factors on the issue of reasonableness are that the range
of potential values as assessed at the time was between US$5m and US$7m (with
US$5.4m being later established as the correct figure). A demand of US$6m
self-evidently exhausted or very nearly exhausted all interests involved.
Further, any indication of agreement to pay anything like the initial demand
would almost inevitably have fed a suspicion on the pirates’ part that they had
demanded far too little, and would have complicated matters then and for the
future. In contrast, and in the light of the past experience of other
shipowners whose vessels had been seized by Somalian pirates, there was on the
face of it every reason to give effect to what was evidently the present
owners’ immediate reaction, that is to hire experienced negotiators and engage
on a time-consuming and painstaking process of negotiation.</a></p><a name="para66">

</span>In reaching a conclusion that it would have been reasonable for the owners
to capitulate in response to the very first demand, the courts below were
making an evaluative judgment on the basis of documentary evidence and
material. This is not a situation in which their evaluation commands a large
inherent advantage, compared with that which the Supreme Court is in a position
to make, although of course it merits weight and it is for the cargo interests
to show that it was wrong. In the light of all the circumstances, the cargo
interests have satisfied me that it was wrong. I am unable to accept the
evaluative judgment reached by both courts below to the effect that it would
have been reasonable for the owners to pay the initial ransom, and that, had
they done so, they could have required the full US$6m to be treated as general
average. The reasoning of the courts below appears to me contrary to all the
relevant indications as to how the owners actually acted and would have been
expected to act. It is clear that the owners never contemplated the sort of
remarkable capitulation that payment of the initial ransom would have involved,
and that it would have taken them and other shipowners into uncharted
territory, as opposed to a relatively familiar negotiation process, had they
ever done so. They would in my opinion clearly have been acting unreasonably in
the circumstances had they done so.</a></p><a name="para67">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case has been fought and decided on the basis that this is the
critical issue. No alternative case has been advanced to the effect that
negotiations would or might have led to a settlement at some lesser figure
which might have covered some, no doubt lesser figure of negotiation period
expenses. Lord Neuberger notes (para 20 above) that the actual negotiation
period expenses claimed of US$160,000 would have been covered (together with
the negotiators’ expenses) by a ransom payment of around US$2.4m. That is
mathematically correct. But it does not reflect the reality which has to be
addressed. It postulates immediate agreement on or about 30 January 2009 on a
ransom of US$2.4m. Yet, even in early March 2009 the pirates were still looking
for a ransom of US$3m, reduced on 2 March 2009 to US$2m. Depending on where one
dates and places a reasonable settlement at a reasonable settlement figure, it
is clear that, on this basis, any recoverable negotiation period expenses would
be considerably reduced below the US$160,000-odd claimed. The case has not been
put on a basis which required or allows now for any such hypothetical exercise
(of assessing when and at what figure below US$6m a reasonable settlement could
have been achieved) to be undertaken. The owners have established that Rule F
is in principle capable of applying to negotiation period expenses, which may
well be the principle which this litigation is about. But I do not think that
they have established on the facts that they have any claim on the only factual
