The appellant's arguments involve consideration of the VAT collection system, the interpretation of POCA, and the effect of article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights ("A1P1").</a></p><a name="para1"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The factual and procedural background</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1972, the appellant, Jack Harvey, established a company, JFL Harvey Ltd ("the Company"), whose business was the hiring out of items of machinery. The Company traded from premises in Cornwall, and at all times the appellant owned 98.9% of the shares, the balance being owned by his wife. The Company was registered for VAT, and its accountants ensured that the requirements of the VAT legislation were duly complied with by the Company.</a></p><a name="para2">

The appellant was in due course convicted at the Truro Crown Court of nine counts of handling stolen goods and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. (He was also convicted on a separate indictment of five counts of arson, for which he was sentenced to a consecutive terms of 12 years imprisonment. On appeal, the total sentence was reduced to nine years and six months.)</a></p><a name="para3">

It was conceded on his behalf that the appellant had a "criminal lifestyle" as defined by section 75(3)(a) of POCA. Accordingly, the judge had to decide to what extent, if any, he had benefited over the relevant period from his "general criminal conduct", as defined by subsections (1) and (2) of section 76 of POCA. As the appellant had been charged on 11 November 2009, the relevant period for the purpose of assessing the extent of his benefit began on 11 November 2003.</a></p><a name="para4">

In a judgment given on 16 April 2012, the judge assessed the benefit obtained by the appellant at £2,275,454.40, comprising £1,960,754.40 from general criminal conduct and a further £314,700 from particular criminal conduct. In very summary terms, the sum of £1,960,754.40 was assessed by means of the following three steps: (i) the Company's aggregate turnover for the relevant period was £5,159,880 (inclusive of VAT); (ii) the proportion of stolen items to the total stock over that period was 38%; (iii) the benefit from general criminal conduct was therefore 38% of £5,159,880, namely £1,960,754.40.</a></p><a name="para5">

The appellant was given six months (later extended to 12 months) to pay, and was ordered to serve ten years (reduced to eight years by the Court of Appeal) in default of payment.</a></p><a name="para6">

In a judgment given on 3 July 2013 (Jackson LJ, Wyn Williams J and HH Judge Russell QC) his appeal was dismissed (save in relation to the default sentence) - </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2013/1104.html">[2013] EWCA Crim 1104</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2013/1104.html">[2014] 1 WLR 124</a>.</p>

The Crown's case, which was accepted by the judge and the Court of Appeal, was that it has been authoritatively established that a benefit is "obtained" for the purpose of POCA if it has been received by a defendant, even if he has subsequently had to account to a third party for some, or even all, of it. The appellant's case is that, given that the Company accounted for the VAT to HMRC, it would involve an unacceptable degree of double counting if the VAT is included in the sum which is the subject of the confiscation order.</a></p><a name="para8">

The first question is whether a defendant has benefited from the relevant criminal conduct; the second question concerns the value, or quantification, of that benefit; and the third question is what sum is recoverable from the defendant (and see 
<i>Waya</i>, para 7, which has a slightly fuller exegesis). When considering the first question,

<i>Ahmad </i>at para 49, cited in para 14 above. Hence the factual basis for Mr Mitchell's argument as summarised in para 22 above is correct: the fact that income tax or corporation tax has been paid in respect of a sum of money or an asset which has been acquired as a result of criminal activity, cannot be invoked to reduce the value of the property or the sum of money when assessing what has been "obtained" for the purposes of POCA.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it can fairly be said that, in a number of respects VAT for which a defendant had to account, and has accounted, to HMRC is in a different category from either income or corporation tax, and,

By contrast, a VAT liability arises on each taxable supply, and therefore can be directly and precisely related to the obtaining of the property in question under POCA. This makes it clear, at least in a case where the VAT on a particular transaction has been paid, or even accounted for, to HMRC, that, if the courts below are correct, the United Kingdom government will, albeit through different arms, enjoy double recovery of the VAT: once under VATA and again through POCA.</a></p><a name="para26">

<i>Elida Gibbs</i> cited in para 19 above. As discussed in para 20 above, the tax is intended to be neutral in its impact on taxable persons. We note that the ECJ in 
<i>Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands</i> (Case C-338/98)

Consistently with that approach, and indeed with the reality of the situation, it is difficult to regard output tax which has been collected and accounted for as forming part of the economic advantage derived from criminal offences. These considerations suggest that, where a taxable person has accounted to HMRC for the tax which he collected on their behalf, there may be a degree of artificiality involved in treating him as having "obtained" the VAT in question for the purposes of POCA. Again, no such considerations apply to income tax or corporation tax.</p>

It would seem particularly harsh, even penal, in a case where a defendant has accounted for all the VAT for which he is liable, not to allow him credit for that sum, but that would be the effect of his being rendered liable to a confiscation order in respect of the output tax on his transactions. We accept that it may well be that the Company in this appeal paid no input tax in respect of such of the items used in its hire business as were stolen. However, even if that is the case, this point has force, as it would be hard to justify treating the Company in the same way regardless of whether it had paid the input tax or not.</a></p><a name="para28">

Instead, they seek a confiscation order only, and do not seek to recover the duty: see 
<i>R v Edwards </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/2923.html">[2004] EWCA Crim 2923</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/2923.html">[2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 29</a>, paras 24-25, where it is explained that the existence of this practice was the reason why no breach of A1P1 to the ECHR was argued. In 
<i>Waya, </i>it was observed at para 33 that it might need to be argued in the future whether a proportionate result should not be left to be achieved by way of Executive concession but rather should be the responsibility of the court to which an application for a confiscation order was made. Whatever the basis may be for bringing confiscation proceedings in such cases - as to which, we note the observations of Lord Phillips of Worth Maltravers and Lord Mance in 
<i>R v Varma </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/42.html">[2012] UKSC 42</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/42.html">[2013] 1 AC 463</a>, paras 60-65 - it is questionable whether the same approach can be adopted in relation to VAT. Since VAT is a tax imposed under EU law, the scope for its non-collection as a matter of concession may be less than under domestic law. It is unnecessary to decide that question in the present proceedings, but it raises the possibility of double recovery which HMRC have recognised, and sought to avoid by extra-statutory means, in the context of excise duty.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factors discussed in paras 25-29 above give rise to a powerful argument that, at least when the VAT has been accounted for to HMRC, it, or a sum equivalent to it, has not been "obtained" by the defendant as a matter of ordinary domestic statutory construction. There are judicial observations as to how POCA is to be construed, and in particular what was said in 
<i>Waya </i>para 8 could be cited to support that view. However, we see the force of the argument that POCA is a statute which is complex and difficult to interpret in any event, and that it is important to hold fast to the principle enunciated in 
<i>Waya</i>, para 55(a) and the other judicial observations discussed in para 13 above and by Lord Toulson in paras 94-101 below. In the light of these observations, and in the interests of minimising the risk of uncertainty as to the meaning of POCA, we reject the first way in which the appellant puts his case.</a></p><a name="para30">

Although application of the 1998 Act can be said to involve interpretation of POCA, the issue raised by the appellant's alternative case involves accepting that POCA, normally construed, has the effect argued for by the Crown, but then going on to consider whether that interpretation infringes A1P1, and, to the extent that it does, modifying the effect of that construction so that it no longer has that infringing effect.</a></p><a name="para31">

<i> </i>in 
<i>Waya </i>at paras 28-33, where it was made clear that, where the proceeds of crime are returned to the loser, it would be disproportionate to treat such proceeds as part of the "benefit obtained" by a defendant as it would amount to "a financial penalty" or "an additional punitive sanction", which should not be imposed through the medium of POCA. Lord Hughes is right in para 71 to say that recognition of the disproportionality of treating property restored to the victim as property "obtained" for the purpose of POCA is not directly in point as it does not concern double recovery. However, given that VAT is effectively collected by a taxpayer as explained above, the two situations are quite similar; furthermore, as Lord Mance points out, the policy behind the principle discussed in 
<i>Waya</i>, paras 28-34 is in part that a defendant who makes good a liability to pay or restore should not be worse off than one who does not.</a></p><a name="para33">

<i>Waya</i>, "[t]here may be other cases of disproportion analogous to that of goods or money entirely restored to the loser", which would "have to be resolved case by case", That came to pass in 
<i>Ahmad</i>, where this court held that it would be disproportionate for the same sum to be recovered from two co-conspirators in respect of the same property which they had obtained jointly. At para 71, the court said that "it would not serve the legitimate aim of the legislation and would be disproportionate for the state to take the same proceeds twice over". The point was repeated in the following paragraph, where it is said that: "[t]o take the same proceeds twice over would not serve the legitimate aim of the legislation and, even if that were not so, it would be disproportionate". We consider those observations are applicable in this case in relation to the VAT which has been accounted for to HMRC.</a></p><a name="para34">

It should be said at the outset that the potential inconvenience involved in applying POCA in a manner which is consistent with A1P1 is not a good reason for failing to do so. There are also likely to be many cases where there will be no good reason to doubt that VAT has been properly accounted for to HMRC. Nevertheless, particularly given that POCA claims almost always involve dishonest defendants, we would accept that there may often be difficulties in assessing the amount of VAT to be treated as accounted for to HMRC. However, in some cases, it will be clear, and, where it is not, the judge trying the issue should be guided by two important factors. First, although the burden may be on the Crown to establish the gross value of the benefit obtained by the defendant (ie in this case £2,275,454.40), the burden of establishing that a sum, and if so what sum, should be deducted from that value to reflect VAT accounted for to HMRC lies on the defendant. Secondly, as in many exercises involved in assessments under POCA, a judge should be robust in making such a determination. There is nothing disproportionate about taking a broad-brush approach to questions of what sums were received or paid in the context of criminal activity, where the evidence is confusing, unreliable and/or incomplete. On the contrary: the risk of disproportionality may lie more in spending much time and money pursuing a precise answer which is at best elusive and more frequently unattainable.</a></p><a name="para35">

We would leave open the position in relation to VAT for which the defendant is liable, but in respect of which he has not accounted, to HMRC, essentially for the reasons given in paras 27-28 above. We are conscious that we are leaving undecided a question which will in practice confront Crown Court judges, but it is one which raises difficult issues extending beyond VAT (as Lord Mance explains in para 47), on which the court has not been addressed in the present appeal.</a></p><a name="para36">

<i>R v Waya</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/51.html">[2012] UKSC 51</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/51.html">[2013] 1 AC 294</a>, as supporting his conclusion that it is not disproportionate to ignore output VAT for which the defendant has accounted. In my view that decision both opens the issue under A1P1 and leaves its resolution open. Likewise, although there is a distinction between evasion cases (where payment may be said to redress the offence) and the present case (where the dishonest transaction under which the VAT was obtained remains unredressed), that does not answer the question whether VAT accounted for should be given special treatment under A1P1.</p>

But they have this in common, that one reason why restoration is taken into account is that a defendant who has made good his liability to restore should not be in a worse position when it comes to the making of a confiscation order than a defendant who has not done so. That also applies to a defendant who has actually accounted for VAT to HMRC.</a></p><a name="para40">

The actual question certified by the Court of Appeal was whether "any VAT accounted for 
<i>and/or</i> paid to HMRC should be subtracted from the turnover figure" (emphasis added). Consistently with this, the agreed statement of facts and issues (para 31) identifies as the question for our determination whether any deduction should be "(i) the total amount of VAT received from customers; (ii) the net amount paid to HMRC (after deduction of input tax); or (iii) some other figure".</a></p><a name="para41">

As indicated in paras 16 and 17 of Lord Neuberger's and Lord Reed's judgment, output VAT is due when charged to the recipient of the goods or services. The entitlement to set it off against input VAT is merely a facility that is permitted at the end of a relevant accounting period in which there happens to be such input VAT: Value Added Tax Act 1994 ("VATA"), section 25(2).</a></p><a name="para42">

That is also true. But equally there will be cases where it is crystal clear that the input tax was due. Could the happenstance that the defendant has offset output VAT against input VAT clearly payable to him by HMRC, rather than actually disbursed the output VAT to HMRC, make all the difference? In my opinion, not. Either way the defendant has in reality and law satisfied his obligation to HMRC to account for or pay the full output VAT he has received.</a></p><a name="para43">

As regards the difficulties involved, that is a generalisation, which, as noted in the previous paragraph, will by no means necessarily be true. But, even when and where it is true, the process of making a confiscation order is, as Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson themselves recognised, inherently complex. Criminal courts have under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to make a whole series of often very difficult assessments, eg as to the nature and scale of offending, as to benefits received and as to means.</a></p><a name="para44">

The onus will also be on the defendant to show that he has accounted for and met his obligations in respect of output VAT whether by remittance or set off against input VAT due from HMRC. Judges can and should also be robust in their assessments and determinations under POCA, as Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed indicate in para 35 of their judgment.</a></p><a name="para45">

In such a case, the question may arise whether a confiscation order may be made by reference to the VAT received or taken as received, even though such VAT remains due to HMRC who may require it to be paid or accounted for. That has a parallel in the question arising from cases such as

He was also convicted of arson of a competitor's machinery. After reduction on appeal, he is serving a total sentence of nine years and six months. He had carried on his business through a limited company which was properly treated as his alter ego, so that its receipts were his. On the findings of the judge, he had effectively run his business to a considerable extent on stolen machinery. Some 38 different stolen machines, plus a quantity of accessories, were identified and traced following the intervention of the police; the earliest thefts were some nine years beforehand. The judge assessed the proportion of stolen machinery in his total stock at 38%. The defendant was found to be in possession of blank invoices in varying names, such as strongly suggested a practice of forgery to disguise the origins of stolen property.</a></p><a name="para49">

Because of the number of offences the lifestyle provisions of that Act applied to the assessment of the defendant's benefit. Accordingly, all property passing through his hands in the relevant six year period was to be assumed to be the proceeds of crime except to the extent that the defendant could prove on the balance of probabilities that any item was not, and unless the making of such an assumption would give rise to a serious risk of injustice: see section 10. The judge heard the evidence of the defendant himself and several witnesses called on his behalf. Except for the accountant who prepared the company accounts, the judge found the evidence untruthful; the accountant was truthful but much of his source material provided by the defendant was not. The judge accordingly found that the principal component of the benefit obtained by the defendant as a result of or in connection with his criminal conduct was 38% of the total business receipts of the company from the hiring out of plant. There is no complaint about this method of calculation. Other benefit brought the total to £2,275,454.40.</a></p><a name="para50">

Both the judge and the Court of Appeal held that there was no basis for deducting that element from the gross receipts (or, rather, from 38% of them) in arriving at the benefit obtained and thus, in due course, at the amount of the confiscation order.

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-top:26.0pt">It should be noted that there has been no assessment of the accuracy of the VAT declarations. Since the judge declined to deduct any VAT element, it was not necessary to embark on such an investigation. The defendant's use of forged invoices, never mind the clear findings of unrecorded trading, would at the least raise real queries as to the figures. Moreover, the declared output tax would seem to have been upon the on-book transactions of which the accountant had knowledge, but presumably not on the off-book ones. So it would appear distinctly likely that the defendant under-declared output VAT, at least to the tune of 20% of £94,400, which is a little under £12,900.</p>

There, the benefit obtained was (as was agreed) the pecuniary advantage of evading payment of (not liability for) excise duty on smuggled cigarettes. That pecuniary advantage was indisputably obtained. As Laws LJ had put it in a case of tax evasion by fraud, if the crime had not been detected, the defendant would have been "better off to the tune of £4m" (
<i>R v Dimsey</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2261.html">[1999] EWCA Crim 2261</a>). The decision of the House of Lords in

<i>Smith</i>, additionally negated by seizure of the cigarettes under the excise legislation, could not alter the fact that the benefit had been obtained.

The same principle is also inherent in Lord Bingham's seminal judgment in 
<i>May</i>, for it was there decided that the fact that the benefit had been jointly obtained with, and shared with, an accomplice did not mean that the defendant had not obtained the whole of it (recently re-affirmed in 
<i>R v Ahmad</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/36.html">[2014] UKSC 36</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/36.html">[2015] AC 299</a>). This principle famously led Lord Bingham to make clear, in the same judgment at para 9, that proceeds of crime legislation is not confiscation as the schoolboy would understand it:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">"Although 'confiscation' is the name ordinarily given to this process, it is not confiscation in the sense in which schoolchildren and others understand it. A criminal caught in possession of criminally-acquired assets will, it is true, suffer their seizure by the state. Where, however, a criminal has benefited financially from crime but no longer possesses the specific fruits of his crime, he will be deprived of assets of equivalent value, if he has them. The object is to deprive him, directly or indirectly, of what he has gained. 'Confiscation' is, as Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough observed in 
<i>In re Norris</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/34.html">[2001] 1 WLR 1388</a>, para 12, a misnomer."</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The post-conviction provisions of POCA (Parts 2, 3 and 4 for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively), and their statutory predecessors, constitute a scheme for penalising criminals by imposing not a fine but a financial order geared to what they obtained by their crime. A fine would be unrelated to what was obtained and would be measured, rather, by the culpability and harm involved in the underlying offence. It would take account of the obligations as well as the assets of the defendant. A post-conviction confiscation order is different, and may often be swingeing. It was described in 
<i>Waya</i> at para 12 as "deprivation of property as a form of penalty". It should be emphasised that such confiscation is not designed to restore money to the state, since the state is, in most cases, not the loser by the crime. It is designed to deprive the offender.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt a different scheme could have been prescribed, and one such might have involved calculation of retained benefit. In some countries schemes for the confiscation of criminal proceeds do follow this approach, notably those which rely upon tracing and recovering specific property. The UK system does not. It depends upon ascertaining the value of what was obtained, and then recovering not specific property but, rather, that sum. Having obtained such a sum through crime, the defendant is expected to surrender it from 
<u>any</u> assets which he holds, whether they were legitimately or criminally acquired. That, as Lord Bingham observed in 
<i>May</i> at para 46, involves no injustice or lack of proportionality. It might be added that two considerable disadvantages of a system which depends on retained benefit are the ease with which confiscation can be avoided by complicated concealment of what has happened to the initial proceeds and the complexity of the investigation and calculations which fall to be made by the court into transactions which a criminal is unlikely to record. UK confiscation under POCA does not, it might be thought, at present want for sufficient complexity.</a></p><a name="para56">

<p class="ParaHeading">Are taxes different?</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are taxes different from other expenses or incidental outgoings because they are money paid to the State, which is also the recipient of confiscation orders? No doubt in the case of the simple paradigm criminal, the question is unlikely to arise. The burglar or thief will rarely pay income tax or fall liable to other taxes in connection with his crime. But many of the most serious acquisitive criminals will. Those who make a business out of their crime may well do so, and especially if they adopt the cover of legitimate trade under which to pursue offences such as drug trafficking, fraud or smuggling. The bigger the criminal operation, the more likely it is that the outgoings incidental to the crime will include one or more forms of tax payable to the state. The smuggler running a fleet of lorries will need operator's licences, will pay probably heavy liabilities in fuel duty, will pay business rates on his depot(s) and employers' national insurance contributions for those who work for him, as well as falling liable to corporation tax on his business profits. If what he is smuggling is drugs, they will probably be sold clandestinely and there will be no question of corporation tax being paid on the profits. But if the contraband is container loads of cigarettes or wine and spirits, it may well be sold as if legitimate through the front of an apparently honest trade outlet, and corporation tax accordingly may be paid. These outgoings are no different from the other expenses of criminal offending, some of which may themselves be overtly criminal, such as payments to subordinates or the purchase price of drugs or contraband, and some of which may be neutral, such as the cost of fuel or accommodation or the stamp duty paid on the laundering of the proceeds through the purchase of real property. There is no relevant difference, for example, between the prime cost of fuel used to transport contraband and the fuel tax element of the pump price. It is simply impossible to distinguish between these different types of outgoing on the basis that some are payments made to the state and others are not. None of these outgoings affects the question of what is obtained. Nor, when it comes to proportionality of the confiscation order, does any of them give rise to any disproportion if the order is based on the gross receipts. Nor has the contrary been suggested in any of the arguments before this court.</a></p><a name="para58">

It is certainly true that corporation tax and income tax are essentially taxes on profits, and that they are not taxes on individual transactions. But this is not a material distinction. Other taxes, such as fuel tax and excise duty on alcohol, are essentially levied on individual transactions, and moreover the tax paid by the trader is passed on to consumers in the price of each later transaction. Business rates are levied neither on profits nor individual transactions, but on the occupation of premises. National insurance is levied on the engagement of employees. There is nothing distinctive in the mechanics of VAT which differentiates it relevantly from other taxes when it comes to asking the questions posed at para 60.</a></p><a name="para61">

Likewise the (input) tax which he is entitled to reclaim is identical to the total VAT which he has been charged by those from whom he has bought goods or services. This is indeed an important characteristic of VAT. But it does not follow from this that he has not obtained the (output) VAT which is included in his charges to his customers. On the contrary, fiscal neutrality is equally achieved if he 
<u>does</u> obtain the VAT element, but is then required to pay an identical sum to the Revenue. Nor does it follow that his interest in the VAT element obtained is nil; there will still be fiscal neutrality if his interest is substantial but he comes under a corresponding obligation to pay the same sum to the Revenue. Nor, lastly, does fiscal neutrality answer the question whether there is anything disproportionate in declining to net off the VAT element when calculating the amount of a confiscation order under POCA, in the same way as it is agreed that the system declines to set off other outgoings, including other taxes payable to the state.</a></p><a name="para62">

But the mechanics of VAT simply do not work by making the taxable trader the agent of the state in collecting VAT. He is obliged by the Value Added Tax Act 1994 to charge VAT on his supply of goods or services, and he is treated as having done so by the statutory rule that his price for such supply is deemed to be VAT inclusive. But if his customer pays his price, the VAT element in no sense belongs to the Revenue, but to the recipient trader. It is not held on any kind of trust for the Revenue. The trader is free to do with the money whatever he wants. His obligation to the Revenue is not to deliver up something which he has collected for it, but the different one of accounting for tax according to what he has charged and what he has paid out. When he renders the invoice he comes under the obligation to account to the Revenue for the VAT element, that is to say to declare it. In due course at the end of the accounting period he is obliged to pay the Revenue 
<b>not </b>the amount of VAT charged to his customers, but the difference between the total output VAT charged and the total input VAT paid. The input tax which he can reclaim is not transaction-specific. He can reclaim any input tax which he has paid in any part of his business, and even if he has paid nothing at all in relation to the subject matter of the supply(ies) on which he has charged output tax. If his input tax exceeds his output tax, as it may well if he is trading predominately in exempt or zero rated supplies, he has to pay nothing to the Revenue even though he has charged and received output tax on some of his trading. Otherwise his obligation is only to pay the difference between the sums charged by way of output tax and the sums paid out by way of input tax. He is under that obligation whether or not his customer has paid him. There is provision in the Act (section 36) for subsequent adjustments as between the trader and the Revenue by way of bad debt relief if the customer fails altogether to pay, but in the meantime the trader's liability to pay the Revenue the difference between output receipts and input payments is unaffected by any such failure, whilst if the customer simply delays, the trader must nevertheless pay up promptly. None of these rules can possibly co-exist with a legal framework in which the trader is collecting the output tax on behalf of the Revenue.</a></p><a name="para63">

Input tax need not relate to the transaction on which output tax has been charged. Moreover, whilst it is undoubtedly true that the philosophy underlying the tax is that the effective burden of it will fall on the ultimate consumer, this is by no means only true of VAT. In the UK, the predecessor of VAT was purchase tax, which was levied on wholesalers only. But in effect that tax was passed down the line of supplies and similarly ended up being felt in the price paid by the consumer: see the analysis of Mance LJ (as he then was) in

It was there held that for the purpose of a rent clause which made the rent variable with the tenants' turnover, that expression included the VAT element in receipts. The provision in the Companies Act 2006 on which the appellant in the present case relies is similarly contextual. It is applied by section 474 for the purposes of Part 15 of that Act only. Part 15 is concerned with rules for companies to render accounts and reports. The references to turnover in that part of the Act are to the means of classification of companies as "small", or as "medium sized", for the purposes of differing regimes for accounts and reports: see sections 381-383, 441-444 and 465-466. "Turnover" does not refer to anything stated in accounts. There is no comparability between this categorisation rule and the entirely different context and purposes of POCA, and it is not possible to read across from the one to the other.</a></p><a name="para65">

The test of proportionality comes to be applied at the next stage, when one asks what confiscation order is to be made. This was explained in 
<i>Waya</i> at paras 15 and 16. The A1P1 requirement of proportionality is given effect by reading down section 6(5)(b) of POCA. There is no question of reading down section 76(4) or (7), which is where it is provided that a defendant benefits when he obtains property as a result of or in connection with his (criminal) conduct, and to the extent of the value of what he obtains. Nor is there any question of reading down section 80, which is where the rules for valuation of benefit are set out. The section which is read down is section 6(5)(b) which requires the making of an order in the sum of the recoverable amount (defined in section 7(1) as the value of the benefit obtained). Section 6(5)(b) is read down by adding the qualification "except insofar as such an order would be disproportionate and thus a breach of article 1, Protocol No 1" and the section has now been amended to this effect. This difference is not simply technical. It may matter. Because the focus is on the fairness (proportionality) of the amount of the ultimate order, then if the VAT element 
<b>is </b>to be deducted there might be a difference between a defendant who has paid the VAT element over to the Revenue, and a defendant who, even if he has declared it, has not paid it.</a></p><a name="para69">

In the end, the amount of the confiscation order depended on the correct analysis of what benefit had been obtained rather than on departure from the amount of such benefit on grounds of disproportion: see para 78.

As has already been explained at para 55 above, that decision of the House of Lords proceeded upon two clearly correct propositions: first that the defendant had obtained the pecuniary advantage of evading payment of excise duty (not the liability to pay it), and second that the subsequent forfeiture of the contraband did not un-obtain that pecuniary advantage. The court in 
<i>Waya</i> went on to disclaim any analysis of excise duty cases, but it recorded that the practice of the Revenue is not, in cases of evasion of payment, to claim both confiscation in the amount of the excise duty and civil recovery of the same excise duty. That practice, the court noted, appeared to have been adopted in order to avoid disproportionate double recovery.</p>

<i>R v Edwards</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/2923.html">[2004] EWCA Crim 2923</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/2923.html">[2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 29</a>, paras 24 to 25, has been confirmed to this court in the course of argument, albeit it is recorded only in various letters written in individual cases. It appears to be adopted at least in those cases where the offence charged is of tax evasion 
<u>and</u> the confiscation order is for (or includes) the same specified sum of tax evaded. It is not difficult to see that offences of evasion of payment of taxes are in a category of their own. There, the benefit consists of the pecuniary advantage of evasion of payment, not of liability. Payment, once made, satisfies the obligations of the defendant. So if payment is then made in full, whether voluntarily, or by way of civil recovery by the Revenue, or under a confiscation order made for the sum evaded, the liability has been met. In that sense, the position is analogous to total restoration cases. But the excise duty cases, such as 
<i>R v Smith (David)</i>, also demonstrate the absence of any wider or more general rule against "double recovery", for it is the state which forfeits contraband which is discovered, but that does not in any sense invalidate the proportionality of imposing on the smuggler a confiscation order based upon his evasion of payment of duty.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74">74.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 
<i>Ahmad</i> this court confronted a different kind of "double recovery". The two defendants had jointly obtained some millions of pounds through their crime. This court held that although confiscation orders against each of them were properly made for the full amount obtained, it would be disproportionate for the orders both to be enforced in full, thus yielding twice the proceeds of crime to the state. That sheds no light on the present question.</a></p><a name="para74">

But the case of a trader defendant who did not declare any output VAT need not affect the answer to the question posed. He might be prosecuted also for evasion of that liability. Assuming, however, that the VAT element of gross receipts does not fall to be deducted, the benefit of the VAT offence would overlap with the benefit of the dishonest handling and would not increase it.</a></p><a name="para75">

But it is clear both in principle and from the judgment in 
<i>Waya</i> that there is no room for any general rule that "double recovery" is either (a) a necessary or (b) a sufficient determinant of when a confiscation order will be disproportionate. As to (a), cases of total restoration to the loser cannot be described as involving double recovery for the loser is in most such cases not the state. As to (b), it is clear from 
<i>Waya</i>, as from the argument in the present case, that there is nothing disproportionate about a proceeds of crime regime which confiscates the gross proceeds of offending without giving credit for taxes, direct or indirect, paid to the state. That is so, even though this plainly involves the state both receiving the taxes earlier paid and recovering by way of the confiscation order. This follows from the general rule that confiscation is entitled to fasten on gross receipts rather than on profits. There is nothing disproportionate in the mere fact that the consequences of detection and confiscation may leave the criminal worse off than if he had not committed the crime. Once the position as to taxes generally is accepted, there is no sufficient basis for singling out VAT as requiring different treatment; indeed it would be inconsistent to do so. For the reasons set out in paras 59-65 above, the characteristics of VAT, to the extent that they can be distinguished from those of other taxes, are distinctions without a relevant difference.</a></p><a name="para76"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contention on behalf of the present appellant was that the confiscation order was unlawfully disproportionate to the extent that it did not give credit for 38% of the total output VAT declared (ie 38% x £843,827 = £320,654; see para 52 above), because that was said to be the sum which would be wrongly "doubly recovered". If that were to be the necessary consequence of giving credit for the VAT element in gross receipts, it would follow that the Crown Court would have to determine whether there had been a full declaration of output tax and, in order to discover the extent of "double recovery", it would have also to determine whether the input tax claimed was all properly offsettable. That would add inordinately, and inappropriately, to the already complex task of the Crown Court when considering a confiscation application, and would in practice mean that the Revenue had to be a participant in every case. That would not be proportionate. It would also mean, as Jackson LJ pointed out in the Court of Appeal, that the order is reduced even though the defendant has used the criminally obtained output VAT element of his receipts from customers to buy goods and services, which is itself an offence: see the passage quoted by Lord Toulson at para 117. But an alternative way of giving credit for VAT might, if the principle were a sound one, be to deduct from the gross receipts the net VAT actually paid (here £200,745.03) or, more accurately I think, 38% of that sum (£76,283.11). However, for the reasons given, the suggested principle is unsound.</a></p><a name="para77"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to this view, the judgments of Lord Neuberger, Lord Reed and Lord Mance hold that in order to meet the requirement of proportionality the output VAT element in relevant receipts must (unlike other taxes payable) be deducted from the confiscation order in some circumstances. It is to be deducted, they all agree, when it has been "accounted for to HMRC (either by remittance or by its being set off against input tax"): see Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed at para 36 and Lord Mance at para 46. That would appear to mean that the output tax is to be subtracted from the confiscation order if the trader has declared it 
<u>and</u> paid either it, or the difference between it and input tax he claims to set off. That, as I understand it, will leave it to the Crown Court to determine in each case whether to investigate the propriety of the input set-off or not. For the reasons set out above and those additionally explained by Lord Toulson, I myself do not regard this as satisfactory, as a means of determining when an order will be disproportionate, but the working out of this principle must be for Crown Courts and the Court of Appeal; it may be that in practice Crown Courts will be entitled to take the view that the input tax can be taken as correct unless good reason is shown by the Crown (or by the Revenue) to query it, but since most defendants will by definition be unreliable or dishonest, such good reason is very likely to exist in most cases. In that event the kind of case management envisaged by Lord Toulson (para 125) seems likely to be necessary. The question of what to do if the output tax has 
<u>not</u> been paid (with or without set-off for input tax) is left open (see Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed at para 36). The intention would seem to be to avoid requiring the defendant to pay the VAT output element twice, once by way of inclusion in a confiscation order and once by way of orthodox recovery of VAT by the Revenue. If that is the intention, Crown Court judges need to know how to proceed when confronted by a confiscation application. They are obliged to make an order and have no discretion not to do so. There is no mechanism by which they can put the Revenue, which is not a party to the proceedings, on terms that the VAT is not to be recovered by orthodox enforcement. If they simply deduct the output VAT element whether it has been paid or not, and whether or not there is any reasonable prospect of it being paid, they risk making an order which is unduly favourable to the defendant and in no sense required by proportionality, even on the majority view.</a></p><a name="para78">

The practical difficulties set out in para 35 which surround giving effect to the decision of the majority in this case seem to me to provide additional reasons why this is so.</a></p><a name="para79">

<i>R v Banks</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1996/1799.html">[1997] 2 Cr App R (S) 110</a> the Court of Appeal was concerned with section 4(1) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. This provided that "any payments or other rewards received by a person ... in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him or another person are his proceeds of drug trafficking" and "the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking is the aggregate of the values of the payments or other rewards". It was argued that the value of such payments should be taken to be the net value. Lord Bingham CJ said that there were four insuperable objections to this argument. The first derived from the statutory language, which he read as directing the court's attention to gross payments. The second objection was to be found in a series of decisions under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (the predecessor of the 1994 Act). Among other authorities he cited the judgment of Lord Lane CJ in 
<i>R v Smith (Ian)</i> [1989] 1 WLR 765, 769:</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom: 26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-size:13.0pt">"The words 'any payments' are on the face of them clear. They must mean, indeed it is clear from the wording, any payment in money or in kind ...</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom: 26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-size:13.0pt">It seems to us that the section is deliberately worded so as to avoid the necessity, which the appellant's construction of the section would involve, of having to carry out an accountancy exercise, which would be quite impossible in the circumstances of this case. It may be that the wording is draconian, and that it produces a draconian result. But it seems to us that if that is the case, it was a result intended by those who framed the Act."</span></p>

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">Lord Bingham's third insuperable objection was that the relevant provisions of the 1986 Act had been re-enacted in almost precisely the same terms in the 1994 Act. It could not be said that the statute had simply been reproduced without attention being paid to the intervening case law, because other amendments had been made which showed that attention had been paid to intervening case law. The court was therefore bound to proceed on the assumption that Parliament re-enacted the provision, knowing of the decisions which had been made on them and intending that they should have that effect.</span></a></p><a name="para99">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">Lord Bingham's fourth objection was that the 1994 Act also contained provisions which made it an offence to conceal or disguise property which directly or indirectly represented the proceeds of drug trafficking. Lord Bingham considered that it would "reduce those provisions to absurdity" if they did not refer to the aggregate of the payments received, and that the same term must bear the same meaning in the earlier and later sections of the Act.</span></a></p><a name="para100">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The same four points apply to section 76(4) of the 2002 Act. It is true that its language is slightly different from the language used in the earlier drug trafficking legislation (although not the language of the CJA 1988), but Lord Bingham said in 
<i>Jennings v Crown Prosecution Service</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/29.html">[2008] UKHL 29</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/29.html">[2008] AC 1046</a>, para 13 that the appellate committee regarded the meaning of section 71(4) as "in substance the same as the equivalent provisions of the drug trafficking legislation". Lord Bingham's fourth point in 
<i>R v Banks</i> can be made by reference to the money laundering offences in sections 327 to 329 of the 2002 Act. These penalise various forms of dealing with criminal property, which is defined in section 340(3) as property which constitutes or represents a person's benefit from criminal conduct. More broadly, for nearly 30 years it has been a central feature of the statutory confiscation schemes that in identifying and assessing the defendant's benefit from criminal conduct, the court is concerned with the gross value of what he has obtained in cash or in kind. As Lord Walker and Hughes LJ observed in 
<i>R v Waya</i> at para 26, to embark on an accounting exercise in which the defendant is entitled to set off the cost of committing his crime would be to treat his criminal enterprise as if it were a legitimate business and confiscation as a form of business taxation. The cost to the appellant of his form of criminal conduct included his liability to HMRC for VAT on the service provided by him to customers; the gross value of what he obtained was the gross income from hiring out stolen goods.</p>

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant's argument fails to focus on the moment when the moneys were paid into the company's account, but depends on later payments out of the account. This approach is contrary to the proper approach as stated in 
<i>R v Smith (David)</i> and 
<i>R v Waya</i>. Departure from that approach in this case is not only contrary to the language of the statute and to authority, but it would lead inevitably to future arguments and uncertainty about whether the courts should make similar exceptions in other cases of perceived hardship.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">A measure which deprives a person of his property must not only serve a legitimate aim, but there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between that aim and the measure adopted to achieve it. In deciding whether that requirement is satisfied, the Strasbourg court has recognised that the state enjoys a wide margin of appreciation as to the choice of means of enforcement and its assessment of whether consequences are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving its legitimate aim: see, for example, 
<i>Jahn v Germany</i> (2005) 42 EHRR 1084, para 93.</span></a></p><a name="para106">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The primary aim of the present legislation is to provide a practicable means of taking away from criminals their proceeds of crime. A secondary aim is to deter others. These are legitimate aims. The mere fact that enforcement of the order will in many cases leave the criminal worse off than if he had never committed an offence does not of itself mean that the measure is disproportionate.</span></a></p><a name="para107">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">Double recovery of the same benefit is another matter and is liable to be disproportionate as going against the grain of the legislation: see 
<i>R v Waya</i>, paras 20 and 30 to 34. But it is important to be careful in the use of the expression "double recovery". Lord Walker and Hughes LJ instanced a case of a confiscation order being sought solely on the basis of the momentary benefit of a thief (or handler of stolen goods) obtaining property which had been restored intact to the true owner before the making of a confiscation order. In such a case the benefit obtained and the benefit restored are identical. To make a confiscation order in respect of that benefit in those circumstances would be disproportionate. It would not serve the aim of the legislation. (It might, on the contrary, act as a disincentive to a thief making reparation before the imposition of a confiscation order; if he had stolen money, he might be better off to keep it and use it to pay the confiscation order.) The court recognised that there might be other cases of disproportion analogous to that of goods or money entirely restored to the owner. These would have to be resolved case by case.</span></a></p><a name="para108">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">In 
<i>R v Ahmad</i> the question of double recovery arose in another way. Co-defendants were found to have benefited jointly from their offending. This court held that it was proper in principle to make confiscation orders against each of them for the full amount of the benefit jointly obtained, but that the orders should contain a provision preventing their enforcement in such a way that the state recovered the same benefit twice over. The court said that "it would not serve the legitimate aim of the legislation and would be disproportionate for the state to take the same proceeds twice over" and that a violation of A1P1 would occur "at the time when the state sought to enforce an order for the confiscation of proceeds of crime which have already been paid to the state" (paras 71-72).</span></a></p><a name="para109">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">In this case the appellant argues that where the benefit consists of income derived from payments by customers of invoices for the hire of stolen plant which included (or are to be taken as including) the VAT for which the supplier was liable on the supply, and where the supplier has either paid that amount to HMRC or offset it against input tax paid on purchases of goods or services by the supplier, the amount so paid or offset should be deducted in arriving at the final amount of the confiscation order so as to avoid double recovery, which would be disproportionate and contrary to A1P1.</span></a></p><a name="para110">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The prosecution argue that liability for VAT is part of the expense of carrying on a business. Under section 1 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, VAT on any supply of goods and services is a liability of the person making the supply. It is not disproportionate to the object of the legislation that in making a confiscation order the court should ignore expenses incurred by defendant, whether of a fiscal nature or otherwise.</span></a></p><a name="para111">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant counters that argument by saying that VAT is unlike other forms of taxation. It is regulated by a series of European Directives. Its purpose and nature are that the trader in gathering and paying VAT is acting as a tax collector for the state: 
<i>Elida Gibbs Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>(Case C-317/94) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C31794.html">[1996] ECR I-5339</a>, para 22. (The trader who is VAT registered is required by regulations to provide a VAT invoice to the customer, and even if VAT is not shown as a discrete charge in a trader's invoice, it is treated as such for revenue purposes: paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 of the VAT Act.) By paying or accounting for that element of the benefit received by way of customers' payments, the trader makes restitution to the state, and for that amount to be included in the confiscation would amount to the state taking the same thing twice.</p>

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">For my part, as a matter of general principle I do not consider it disproportionate to the legitimate aim of the legislation for the court, when making a confiscation order, to disregard outgoings associated with property obtained by a defendant as a result of or in connection with his criminal conduct; and I cannot see a satisfactory reason in general for distinguishing fiscal from other outgoings. Examples would include a person who pays income tax on criminal earnings, a company which pays corporation tax on the profits from criminal business or a person who pays stamp duty or capital gains tax in connection with the laundering of criminal property. In such cases the liability to tax arises because the defendant's overall profit after setting off allowable losses or expenses during the relevant tax period exceeds the relevant tax threshold. They are not cases of the state taking the "same" proceeds twice over, in the sense that the court was speaking of in 
<i>R v Ahmad</i>. They are readily distinguishable from cases in which a thief or handler restores stolen property to its owner or where the amount of confiscation orders made against two or more defendants in respect of their joint benefit is paid off by one or some of them. There is not the same degree of identity between the benefit obtained and the benefit restored or surrendered.</span></a></p><a name="para113">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The known receipts of the company during the relevant period were £5,159,880. There was also significant "off the book" trading. Because of the statutory assumptions applicable to a defendant with a criminal lifestyle, the burden was on the appellant to show what part, if any, of the sums received by the company was not the benefit of his criminal conduct. It has been held that rebuttal of the assumption requires clear and cogent evidence. For this purpose at the confiscation proceedings the appellant gave evidence and called evidence from his two daughters and a friend. The judge found that none of them was worthy of belief. In an attempt to show that nearly all the company's income was from the use of plant lawfully obtained the appellant produced invoices and receipts, but he was unable to show which invoices fitted which pieces of plant. Further there was evidence of forgery of invoices. At his daughter's home the police discovered draft invoices in the names of other plant and machinery traders, and the judge disbelieved the defence evidence about how they came to be there. The only point which told in the appellant's favour was that of 91 pieces of plant found by the police at the company's premises only 39 were identified as having been stolen. Adopting a broad approach, the judge found that not less than 38% of the company's turnover came from the use of stolen plant.</span></a></p><a name="para115">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant's primary argument is that 38% of the entire sum of £843,827 should be deducted from the amount of the confiscation order.

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">"In relation to VAT, the way in which JHL dealt with these moneys is significant. JHL expended three quarters of the VAT which it collected upon the purchase of goods and services. In doing so, JHL was using the proceeds of criminal conduct to purchase those goods and services. It would be wrong in principle for the defendant to be given credit in respect of the VAT element of these purchases."</span></p>

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">I agree. The use of criminal proceeds to purchase goods and services would in fact be itself an offence under section 329 of the 2002 Act.

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant's alternative argument is that there should be a deduction of 38% of the lesser sum of £200,745 said to have been paid to HMRC. Rejecting that argument in the Court of Appeal, Jackson LJ said, at para 80, that it would be wrong for the court to carry out an accounting exercise in respect of VAT collected through the use of stolen property. He had earlier, at para 76, made the general point that in confiscation proceedings the focus is on what money was received and not how it was spent:

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">The question whether there would be dual recovery of the same benefit, such as to offend against A1P1, if the confiscation order were to include the VAT element of his criminal benefit which the appellant has already paid to the state is at first sight more difficult than the appellant's primary argument. In 
<i>R v Waya</i>, para 34, the court spoke of taking a case by case approach to the application of A1P1 to the post-conviction confiscation legislation. Inevitably there will be cases in which it will be possible to point to apparent anomalies on whichever side of the line the question is resolved.</span></a></p><a name="para120">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">On first impression the appellant's alternative argument has a beguiling simplicity and attraction: that in charging VAT to customers the trader acts as a tax gatherer for the state, and, if he pays it to HMRC, he should not be made subject to a confiscation order which includes that amount. But on fuller consideration I am not persuaded that the court should make a distinction between the £843,827 and £200,745.</span></a></p><a name="para121">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is argued that the company was a mere temporary custodian of the £200,745 for the state, but that argument (which goes really to the question whether it was a benefit obtained by the appellant) is unsound. The company was not a custodian of the £843,827 or the £200,745. The entire money received by the company was its money. The description of the company as a tax gatherer for the state is misleading if it is intended to suggest that the company was an agent or trustee of HMRC. The effect of taxing the company on the amount charged by it for the supply of goods and services was to reduce its net profit after tax (unless it increased its charges accordingly) but the same would be true of other forms of taxation, such as corporation tax or capital gains tax or stamp duty on the purchase of a property as part of a crime or as a form of laundering of criminal property. Other examples could be given.</span></a></p><a name="para122">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">Jackson LJ referred in the passage cited to JHL having expended three quarters of VAT which it collected on the purchase of goods and services, but, for all that is presently known, it may have used the entirety of the initial proceeds of its criminal transactions in other transactions funded by money criminally obtained; the use of the criminal funds may or may not have been off the books; and the amount paid by the company to settle its VAT liabilities may or may not have been exceeded by other benefits, which may or may not have been reflected in the company's records. The answers would depend on a full accountancy process, if that were possible. I do not see that it is possible, in principle or in practice, to draw a satisfactory distinction between VAT accounted for and VAT paid. The judge in the Crown Court will face these questions when this case goes back to him to assess the amount of the confiscation order. The majority recognise that there may be difficulties in assessing the amount of VAT to be treated as accounted for to HMRC in the case of a dishonest defendant; that the burden of proof lies on the defendant; and that the court may take a robust and broad-brush approach (para 35). I take it from these observations that the judge will not be obliged to accept that the defendant has accounted to HMRC for VAT merely by producing VAT returns purporting to show that he has offset VAT due against input tax paid on purchases of goods or services. Especially in view of the evidence of forgery of invoices, together with the appellant's possession of draft invoices in the names of other plant and machinery suppliers, the court would be entitled to require evidence from a credible source that the purported transactions, generating the supposed input tax against which the appellant claimed to have offset output tax, were genuine. One test of their genuineness would be whether the supposed supplier had accounted for the input tax claimed to have been paid to the supplier by the appellant's company.</span></a></p><a name="para123">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">This is just the sort of accountancy exercise against which the courts have taken a firm stand from the outset (see, for example, Lord Lane CJ's judgment in 
<i>R v Smith (Ian)</i> referred to at para 98). Moreover, supposing that there were purchases by the company of goods and services in respect of which it paid input tax to the supplier, if those purchases were part of the company's criminal trading it is hard to see why the company should be able effectively to recoup that part of its criminal expenditure by offsetting it against the output tax due from the company to HMRC.</span></a></p><a name="para124">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">For my part, I do not consider it to be disproportionate to the proper object of the confiscation scheme to treat the entirety of the company's receipts from its criminal conduct as having been obtained by the appellant, but the majority consider otherwise. As a matter of practicality, I would expect the next step to be for the judge of the Crown Court to arrange a hearing for directions about evidence. The court should be encouraged to use its case management powers to ensure that the appellant produces all evidence, whether by way of witness statements, documents or expert evidence, in support of his claim to deduct VAT from the amount of the confiscation in a clear and timely fashion.</span></a></p><a name="para125">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">I conclude that the question certified by the Court of Appeal should be answered either in the affirmative or in the negative, but not half and half; and that, although the results in an individual case may seem harsh, A1P1 is not violated by the court adhering to the general principle that in determining the amount of a confiscation order the focus is on the benefits received, ignoring associated outgoings, including tax liabilities. I do not see the application of that principle as going against the grain of the legislation.</span></a></p><a name="para126">

<span style="font-size:13.0pt">I would therefore answer the certified question in the negative and dismiss the appeal.</span></a></p><a name="para127"> </a></div><a name="para127">
