<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal raises a question relating to the temporal scope of Council
Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997, 1998 OJ L14/9, concerning the Framework
Agreement on part-time work (“the directive”) as extended to the United Kingdom
by Council Directive 98/23/EC of 7 April 1998, 1998 OJ L131/10, and the general
principles of EU law governing the non-retroactivity of legislation.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question arises in the context of proceedings between Mr Dermod
O’Brien QC and the Ministry of Justice concerning the pension to which Mr
O’Brien is entitled by reason of his part-time service in a judicial office.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In essence, the question is whether, where a part-time worker retires
after the entry into force of the directive and is entitled under the
directive, taken together with national law, to an occupational pension based
on his length of service, periods of service which were completed before the
directive entered into force should be taken into account.</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="ParaHeading">The facts</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The material facts are as follows. Mr O’Brien is a retired self-employed
barrister who also held part-time judicial office as a recorder (a part-time
judge of the Crown Court) between 1 March 1978 and 31 March 2005, when he
retired at the age of 65. Recorders were not salaried but were paid fees on a
per diem basis. There was no provision for the payment of a judicial pension on
retirement.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In June 2005 Mr O’Brien wrote to the Ministry, requiring that he be paid
a retirement pension on the same basis, adjusted pro rata temporis, as that
paid to former full-time judges who had been engaged on the same or similar
work. He was informed by the Ministry that he fell outside the categories of
judicial office-holder to whom a judicial pension was payable. In September
2005 he began proceedings in the Employment Tribunal, in which he claimed that
he was entitled to a judicial pension by virtue of the directive and the regulations
transposing it into domestic law.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 28 July 2010 the Supreme Court referred two questions to the Court of
Justice for a preliminary ruling under article 267 TFEU:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it for national law to
determine whether or not judges as a whole are ‘workers who have an employment
contract or employment relationship’ within the meaning of clause 2.1 of the
Framework Agreement, or is there a Community norm by which this matter must be
determined?</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If judges as a whole are
workers who have an employment contract or employment relationship within the
meaning of clause 2.1 of the Framework Agreement, is it permissible for
national law to discriminate (a) between full-time and part-time judges, or (b)
between different kinds of part-time judges in the provision of pensions?”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 1 March 2012 the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice, having
received the opinion of the Advocate General (Kokott) on 17 November 2011, gave
judgment: <i>O’Brien </i>(Case C-393/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C39310.html">[2012] 2 CMLR 25</a>. It answered the
questions as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; European Union law must
be interpreted as meaning that it is for the member states to define the
concept of ‘workers who have an employment contract or an employment
relationship’ in clause 2.1 of the Framework Agreement … and in particular, to
determine whether judges fall within that concept, subject to the condition
that that does not lead to the arbitrary exclusion of that category of persons
from the protection offered by Directive 97/81, as amended by Directive 98/23,
and that agreement. An exclusion from that protection may be allowed only if
the relationship between judges and the Ministry of Justice is, by its nature,
substantially different from that between employers and their employees
falling, according to national law, under the category of workers.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Framework Agreement
... must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes, for the purpose of access
to the retirement pension scheme, national law from establishing a distinction
between full-time judges and part-time judges remunerated on a daily fee-paid
basis, unless such a difference in treatment is justified by objective reasons,
which is a matter for the referring court to determine.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following that ruling, the Supreme Court held that Mr O’Brien was at the
material time a part-time worker within the meaning of clause 2.1 of the
Framework Agreement, and that no objective justification had been shown for
departing from the principle of remunerating fee-paid part-time judges on the
same basis as full-time judges, subject to adjustment pro rata temporis. Mr
O’Brien was therefore entitled to a pension on terms equivalent to a circuit
judge (a comparable full-time judge): </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] UKSC 6</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] 1 WLR 522</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case was remitted to the Employment Tribunal for determination of
the amount of the pension to which Mr O’Brien was entitled. The question which
then arose was whether, in calculating the amount of his pension, account
should be taken of the whole of his service since the beginning of his
appointment on 1 March 1978 (a period of 27 years), or only his service since
the deadline for transposing the directive expired (a period of less than five
years). The Employment Tribunal held that the calculation should take into

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Domestic legislation provides for the payment of judicial pensions under
two statutes, the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 and the Judicial Pensions and
Retirement Act 1993. The 1981 Act applies to persons appointed prior to 31
March 1995, unless they elect to have their pension paid under the 1993 Act.
The 1993 Act applies to persons appointed on or after 31 March 1995. Under the
Acts, a pension is payable to any person retiring from “qualifying judicial
office”, subject to their having attained the age of 65 and, under the 1993
Act, subject also to their having completed at least five years’ service in
such office. At the material time, full-time judges and salaried part-time
judges held a qualifying judicial office, but fee-paid part-time judges, such
as recorders, did not. Under both schemes, the amount of pension payable to a
full-time judge is based on his or her final year’s salary and on his or her
number of years’ service in a qualifying judicial office by the date of
retirement. Under the 1981 Act, circuit judges must have served for 15 years in
order to qualify for a full pension of one half of their last annual salary.
The corresponding period under the 1993 Act is 20 years. Under both schemes,
judges who have served for shorter periods receive a proportion of the full
pension corresponding to the length of their service. There is also a lump sum
payable on retirement, the sum being based on the amount of the annual pension.
Judicial pensions were at the material time non-contributory. Since 2012,
judges have had to pay a contribution.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>The United Kingdom gave effect to the directive by the Part-Time Workers
(Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/1551),
which came into force on 1 July 2000. The Regulations provide that a part-time
worker has the right not to be treated by his employer less favourably than the
employer treats a comparable full-time worker. In determining whether a
part-time worker has been treated less favourably than a comparable full-time
worker, the pro rata principle is to be applied unless it is inappropriate. The
Regulations expressly do not apply to fee-paid part-time judges.</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A new rule of law applies from
the entry into force of the act introducing it, and, while it does not apply to
legal situations that have arisen and become definitive under the old law, it
does apply to their future effects, and to new legal situations. It is

</span>The Court applied that principle in the context of the directive in <i>Istituto
Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS) v Bruno </i>(Joined Cases C-395/08
and C-396/08) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2010/C39508.html">[2010] ECR I-5119</a>, where the question arose whether service prior
to the entry into force of the directive counted towards the service required
to qualify for a retirement pension. The Court cited the principle that “new
rules apply, unless otherwise specifically provided, immediately to the future
effects of a situation which arose under the old rule” (para 53), and
concluded:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Accordingly, the calculation of the
period of service required to qualify for a retirement pension such as the
pensions at issue in the main proceedings is governed by Directive 97/81,

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court cited that judgment when rejecting an objection to the
admissibility of the first preliminary reference in the present proceedings. In
<i>O’Brien </i>(Case C-393/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C39310.html">[2012] ICR 955</a>, the Court stated:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Latvian Government
doubts whether the reference for a preliminary ruling is admissible. It is
contrary to the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations and the
principle of legal certainty to hold that Directive 97/81 may apply to facts
which took place before the entry into force of that directive in the United
Kingdom and which continued for a short time after its entry into force, even
if the right to a retirement pension claimed by Mr O’Brien arose after the
expiry of the time-limit for transposing Directive 97/81.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court has already
declared, as regards the applicability ratione temporis of that directive that
new rules apply, unless otherwise specifically provided, immediately to the

concluded that the calculation of the period of service required to qualify for
a retirement pension is governed by Directive 97/81, including periods of
employment before the directive entered into force (Joined Cases C-395/08 and

</span>The Court has treated occupational pensions as a form of pay, the
entitlement to which accrues over the length of the employee’s service. In <i>Ten
Oever v Stichting Bedrijfspensionenfonds voor her Glazenwassers en
Schoonmaakbedrijf </i>(Case C-109/91) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1993/C10991.html">[1993] ECR I-4879</a>, the Court stated, in
relation to its <i>Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group </i>judgment
(Case C-262/88) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/R26288.html">[1990] ECR I-1889</a>:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court’s ruling took
account of the fact that it is a characteristic of this form of pay [scil,
benefits provided for by private occupational pension schemes] that there is a
time-lag between the accrual of entitlement to the pension, which occurs
gradually throughout the employee’s working life, and its actual payment, which
is deferred until a particular age.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the reasons

<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary of arguments

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental difference between the parties is as to whether Mr
O’Brien’s entitlement to a pension in respect of his service prior to 7 April
2000 (the final date for transposition of the directive) should be regarded as
a legal situation which arose and became definitive under the law then in
force, or should be regarded as one of the future effects of a legal situation
which arose under the old law, to which the directive therefore applies.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr O’Brien argues that the reasoning in the <i>Bruno </i>and <i>O’Brien </i>judgments
implies that periods of employment before the directive entered into force are
to be taken into account when applying the directive in situations which arise
after it should have been transposed. In particular, they are relevant not only
to qualification for a retirement pension (which the Ministry does not dispute),
but also to the quantification of that pension, where its quantification is
based on the employee’s length of service.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Ministry argue that since, following <i>Ten Oever,</i> a pension
payable under an occupational pension scheme constitutes deferred pay for past
work, and the worker’s entitlement to pension accrues at the time of the work
for which it constitutes pay, it follows from the non-retroactivity principle
that the accrued right cannot be affected retrospectively by a change in the
law. The entitlement is permanently fixed at the time when the right accrues,
rather than being determined when the person retires and the pension becomes
payable. On that basis, it is argued that Mr O’Brien’s non-entitlement to
pension in respect of his first 22 years of service was definitively
established before the directive entered into force.</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The view of the
national court</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The majority of the court are inclined to think that the effect of
Directive 97/81 is that it is unlawful to discriminate against part-time
workers when a retirement pension falls due for payment. The directive applies
ratione temporis where the pension falls due for payment after the directive
has entered into force. In so far as part of the period of service took place
prior to the directive’s entry into force, the directive applies to the future
effects of that situation.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the Court of Justice has not as yet considered the argument
that if, following the <i>Ten Oever </i>line of authority, an occupational
pension is treated as deferred pay, the right to which is acquired at the time
of the work to which the pay relates, then it follows from the general
principle of non-retroactivity that the directive does not alter or affect
rights acquired (or, in Mr O’Brien’s case, not acquired) before it was brought
into force, there being no provision in the directive which overrides that
general principle. Although the majority of the court are inclined to think
that <i>Ten Oever </i>was concerned with the exceptional <i>Barber </i>limitation,
which does not arise in the present context, the correct approach does not
appear to the Supreme Court to be acte clair.</a></p><a name="para20">

principle of non-discrimination, require that periods of service prior to the
deadline for transposing the Directive should be taken into account when
calculating the amount of the retirement pension of a part-time worker, if they
would be taken into account when calculating the pension of a comparable
full-time worker?</p>
