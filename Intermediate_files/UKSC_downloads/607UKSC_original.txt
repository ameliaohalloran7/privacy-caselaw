</span>This case is about a credit reference negligently supplied by a bank for
a person who subsequently defaulted. The facts are to that extent similar to
those of <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html">[1964] AC 465</a>. But there is a critical difference. The reference was relied upon not by
the party to whom it was addressed but by that party’s undisclosed principal.
The question at issue on this appeal is whether the bank is liable to the
latter.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In October 2010 Hassan Barakat wished to gamble at the London Playboy
Club. He visited the club and applied for a cheque cashing facility for up to
£800,000. Mr Barakat was a Lebanese resident and a well-known figure at a
casino in Lebanon. But he had only once played at the London club. Playboy
Club’s policy for gamblers like him was to require a credit reference from his
bankers for twice the amount of the facility, ie £1.6m. But in order to avoid
disclosing the purpose of the credit facility, the Club’s practice was not
itself to ask its customer’s bank for the reference. Instead, it arranged for
an associated company called Burlington Street Services Ltd to do so without
disclosing the purpose of the inquiry or the fact that the reference was
required for the benefit of another company.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Barakat completed a written application for the cheque-cashing facility,
naming his bankers as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Reggio Emilia, Italy
(“BNL”). A “Status Enquiry Request” was completed. It was written on Burlington’s
printed letterhead and addressed to the relevant branch of BNL. The operative
part of the request read:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We request your opinion as to the
means and standing of Hassan Barakat [details follow] and his/her
trustworthiness to meet a financial commitment to the extent of £1,600,000 at
any one time.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Mr Barakat signed the form of authority at the foot of
the printed form. The operative part of the authority was in the following
terms:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I, Hassan Barakat, hereby consent
to BNL-BNP Paribas Bank … providing a reference on me to Burlington Services
Ltd.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The request was then sent to the Club’s bankers, National
Westminster Bank, who forwarded it to BNL under cover of a letter beginning:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We enclose a request on behalf of
Burlington Street Services Ltd, who would be glad of your opinion on the
character and standing of Hassan Barakat.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The reply from BNL, faxed on 13 October 2010, was
addressed to Burlington c/o National Westminster Bank. It confirmed that Mr
Barakat had an account with them and that he was trustworthy up to £1,600,000
in any one week. It added: “This information is given in strict confidential”
(sic).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In reliance on the reference, the Club granted the cheque cashing
facility on 13 October 2010 and shortly afterwards increased it to £1.25m. Over
four days from 15 to 18 October Mr Barakat played at the club. He drew two
cheques on BNL for a total of £1.25m in return for gaming chips of the same
amount. His net winnings were £427,400, which the Club paid out to him. He then
returned to Lebanon and was not seen again at the Club. Both cheques were
returned unpaid. Including gaming duty, the Club suffered a total net loss of
£802,940. It is common ground that BNL had no reasonable basis for their
reference. It held no account for Mr Barakat until two days after the reference
was sent, when an account was opened in his name which had a nil balance until
it was closed on 14 December 2010.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The Playboy Club, Burlington and another associated company subsequently
began these proceedings against BNL. It is common ground that of the three claimants
the Club is the only party with an interest, neither of the others having
suffered any loss. The trial judge (His Honour Judge Mackie QC) said that BNL
owed a duty of care in relation to its reference to the Club </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2014/2613.html">[2014] EWHC 2613 (QB)</a>. The Court of Appeal disagreed. They held that the only duty was owed to
Burlington, to whom the reference was addressed <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/457.html">[2016] 1 WLR 3169</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the House of Lords in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> <i>&amp; Co
Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> was a landmark in the development of the
law of tort. Contrary to the ordinary rule as it had previously been
understood, it allowed the recovery of a purely economic loss in negligence
where the existence of a special relationship between claimant and defendant
made this appropriate. The facts were that Hedley Byrne asked its bank,
National Provincial Bank, to obtain a credit reference for a company wishing to
place advertising contracts through it. The company’s bank, Heller &amp;
Partners, supplied the reference to National Provincial. The Appellate
Committee inferred as a matter of fact that Heller &amp; Partners must have
appreciated that National Provincial was not acting for its own account but
wanted the reference for a client intending to do business with Heller’s
client, even though they did not know who that client was: see, in particular,
pp 482 (Lord Reid), 493-494 (Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest), 530 (Lord Devlin).
The ratio of the decision was that the reasonable reliance of Hedley Byrne on
the reference, combined with Heller &amp; Partners’ appreciation of the fact
that they would reasonably rely on it, gave rise to a direct relationship
between them involving a duty of care. All five members of the Appellate
Committee gave reasoned judgments, but Lord Devlin’s analysis has generally
been treated in the subsequent case law as most clearly expressing the
reasoning. At pp 529-530, Lord Devlin, said this:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I have had the advantage of
reading all the opinions prepared by your Lordships and of studying the terms
which your Lordships have framed by way of definition of the sort of
relationship which gives rise to a responsibility towards those who act upon
information or advice and so creates a duty of care towards them … It is a
responsibility that is voluntarily accepted or undertaken, either generally
where a general relationship, such as that of solicitor and client or banker
and customer, is created, or specifically in relation to a particular
transaction. … Responsibility can attach only to the single act, that is, the
giving of the reference, and only if the doing of that act implied a voluntary
undertaking to assume responsibility. This is a point of great importance because
it is, as I understand it, the foundation for the ground on which in the end
the House dismisses the appeal ...</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">I do not go further than this for
two reasons. The first is that I have found in the speech of Lord Shaw in <i>Nocton
</i><i>v</i> <i>Lord Ashburton</i> and in the idea of a relationship that is
equivalent to contract all that is necessary to cover the situation that arises
in this case … All that was lacking was formal consideration … </p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">I shall therefore content myself
with the proposition that wherever there is a relationship equivalent to
contract, there is a duty of care. Such a relationship may be either general or
particular. Examples of a general relationship are those of solicitor and
client and of banker and customer … There may well be others yet to be
established. Where there is a general relationship of this sort, it is
unnecessary to do more than prove its existence and the duty follows. Where, as
in the present case, what is relied on is a particular relationship created ad
hoc, it will be necessary to examine the particular facts to see whether there
is an express or implied undertaking of responsibility.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principle thus established is capable of development. Indeed it has
undergone considerable development since 1964, for example to cover omissions
and the negligent performance of services. But these have been incremental
changes within a consistent framework of principle. One area in which the courts
have resisted expanding the scope of liability concerns the person or category
of persons to whom the duty is owed. The defendant’s voluntary assumption of
responsibility remains the foundation of this area of law, as this court
recently confirmed after a full review of the later authorities in <i>NRAM Ltd
(formerly NRAM plc) v Steel</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/13.html">[2018] 1 WLR 1190</a>, paras 18-24 (Lord Wilson JSC).
It is fundamental to this way of analysing the duty that the defendant is
assuming a responsibility to an identifiable (although not necessarily
identified) person or group of persons, and not to the world at large or to a
wholly indeterminate group.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html">[1990] 2 AC 605</a>, the Appellate
Committee held that foreseeability, although it was a necessary condition for
liability, was not necessarily a sufficient one. The foundation of the duty is
proximity, which may require more than the mere foreseeability of reliance. The
problem before the Appellate Committee was to identify the outer limits of the
class of persons whose reliance on a statement could properly be said to give
rise to a sufficiently proximate relationship. They found the relevant limiting
factors in the defendants’ knowledge of (i) the person known to be likely to
rely on the statement, and (ii) the transaction in respect of which he was known
to be likely to rely on. After reviewing the authorities supporting a duty of
care for negligent statements, both before and after <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, Lord
Bridge (with whom Lord Roskill, Lord Ackner and Lord Oliver agreed), summarised
the position as follows at pp 620-621:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The salient feature of all these
cases is that the defendant giving advice or information was fully aware of the
nature of the transaction which the plaintiff had in contemplation, knew that
the advice or information would be communicated to him directly or indirectly
and knew that it was very likely that the plaintiff would rely on that advice
or information in deciding whether or not to engage in the transaction in
contemplation. In these circumstances the defendant could clearly be expected,
subject always to the effect of any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically
to anticipate that the plaintiff would rely on the advice or information given
by the defendant for the very purpose for which he did in the event rely on it.
So also the plaintiff, subject again to the effect of any disclaimer, would in
that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the advice or
information communicated to him for the very purpose for which he required it.
The situation is entirely different where a statement is put into more or less
general circulation and may foreseeably be relied on by strangers to the maker
of the statement for any one of a variety of different purposes which the maker
of the statement has no specific reason to anticipate. To hold the maker of the
statement to be under a duty of care in respect of the accuracy of the
statement to all and sundry for any purpose for which they may choose to rely
on it is not only to subject him, in the classic words of Cardozo CJ to
‘liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an
indeterminate class:’ see <i>Ultramares Corpn </i><i>v</i> <i>Touche </i>(1931)
174 N.E. 441, 444; it is also to confer on the world at large a quite unwarranted
entitlement to appropriate for their own purposes the benefit of the expert
knowledge or professional expertise attributed to the maker of the statement.
Hence, looking only at the circumstances of these decided cases where a duty of
care in respect of negligent statements has been held to exist, I should expect
to find that the ‘limit or control mechanism … imposed upon the liability of a
wrongdoer towards those who have suffered economic damage in consequence of his
negligence’ rested in the necessity to prove, in this category of the tort of
negligence, as an essential ingredient of the ‘proximity’ between the plaintiff
and the defendant, that the defendant knew that his statement would be
communicated to the plaintiff, either as an individual or as a member of an
identifiable class, specifically in connection with a particular transaction or
transactions of a particular kind (eg in a prospectus inviting investment) and
that the plaintiff would be very likely to rely on it for the purpose of deciding
whether or not to enter upon that transaction or upon a transaction of that
kind.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In support of that analysis, Lord Bridge adopted the
celebrated dissenting judgment of Denning LJ in <i>Candler v Crane, Christmas
&amp; Co</i> [1951] 2 KB 164 on the persons to whom an auditor owed a duty of
care in respect of his audit report. At pp 180, 182, 184, Denning LJ had said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To whom do these professional
people owe this duty? I will take accountants, but the same reasoning applies
to the others. They owe the duty, of course, to their employer or client; and
also I think to any third person to whom they themselves show the accounts, or
to whom they know their employer is going to show the accounts, so as to induce
him to invest money or take some other action on them. But I do not think the
duty can be extended still further so as to include strangers of whom they have
heard nothing and to whom their employer without their knowledge may choose to
show their accounts. Once the accountants have handed their accounts to their
employer they are not, as a rule, responsible for what he does with them
without their knowledge or consent … The test of proximity in these cases is:
did the accountants know that the accounts were required for submission to the
plaintiff and use by him?</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… To what transactions does the
duty of care extend? It extends, I think, only to those transactions for which
the accountants knew their accounts were required… </p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">My conclusion is that a duty to
use care in statement is recognised by English law, and that its recognition
does not create any dangerous precedent when it is remembered that it is
limited in respect of the persons by whom and to whom it is owed and the
transactions to which it applies.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his concurring judgment, Lord Oliver, at p 638, identified the
circumstances in which a duty of care “may typically be held to exist” as
follows:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the advice is required
for a purpose, whether particularly specified or generally described, which is
made known, either actually or inferentially, to the adviser at the time when
the advice is given; (2) the adviser knows, either actually or inferentially,
that his advice will be communicated to the advisee, either specifically or as
a member of an ascertainable class, in order that it should be used by the advisee
for that purpose; (3) it is known either actually or inferentially, that the
advice so communicated is likely to be acted upon by the advisee for that
purpose without independent inquiry, and (4) it is so acted upon by the advisee
to his detriment.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The defendant’s knowledge of the transaction in respect of which the
statement is made is potentially relevant for three purposes: (i) to identify
some specific person or group of persons to whom he can be said to assume
responsibility; (ii) to demonstrate that the claimant’s reliance on the
statement will be financially significant; and (iii) to limit the degree of
responsibility which the defendant is taken to assume if no financial limit is expressly
mentioned. We are presently concerned with its significance for the first of
these purposes, which will vary according to what is known about the person or
group expected to rely on the statement. Thus in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> itself, the
defendant understood that the statement would be relied on by the unidentified,
but readily identifiable, client on whose behalf National Provincial Bank was
known to be making the inquiry. It was enough that the proposed transaction was
said to be an advertising contract for £8,000 to £9,000. It would probably have
been enough even if the transaction had not been identified as an advertising
contract but simply as some kind of business transaction. For Lord Morris, for
example, it was enough that the person contemplated was “some one who was
contemplating doing business with Easipower Ltd”: see pp 493-494. In <i>Caparo</i>
on the other hand, where the persons said to have been entitled to rely on the
defendant’s audit report were any potential bidder for the auditor’s client,
the absence of a specific transaction in the defendant’s contemplation assumed
decisive significance.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Salzedo QC, who appeared for the Playboy Club, accepted that there
was no evidence that BNL knew that its reference would be communicated to or
relied on by anyone other than Burlington. He also accepted that in the ordinary
course where a statement is relied upon by B to whom A has passed it on, the
representor owes no duty to B unless he knew that the statement was likely to
be communicated to B. That concession was plainly justified. I would go further
and say that the representor must not only know that the statement is likely to
be communicated to and relied upon by B. It must also be part of the
statement’s known purpose that it should be communicated and relied upon by B,
if the representor is to be taken to assume responsibility to B. Mr Salzedo’s
submission was that the present case was different because the Club was
Burlington’s undisclosed principal. He submitted that the relationship between
BNL and the Club was, in Lord Devlin’s phrase, “equivalent to contract” because
in contract the Club would have been entitled to declare itself and assume the
benefit of the contract. This is an ingenious argument, but in my opinion it is
fallacious.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The rule of English law that an undisclosed principal may declare
himself and enter upon a contract is an anomalous legacy of eighteenth and
nineteenth century jurisprudence, which survives in the modern law on account
of its antiquity rather than its coherence. The law on the point was summarised
by Lord Lloyd of Berwick in <i>Siu Yin Kwan v Eastern Insurance Co Ltd</i>
[1994] 2 AC 199, 207:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An undisclosed principal
may sue and be sued on a contract made by an agent on his behalf, acting within
the scope of his actual authority. (2) In entering into the contract, the agent
must intend to act on the principal’s behalf. (3) The agent of an undisclosed
principal may also sue and be sued on the contract. (4) Any defence which the
third party may have against the agent is available against his principal. (5)
The terms of the contract may, expressly or by implication, exclude the
principal’s right to sue, and his liability to be sued.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">To this I would add that the third party must irrevocably
elect whether to sue the agent or the undisclosed principal.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first problem about the appellants’ argument is that it assumes that
because a relationship “equivalent to contract” is generally sufficiently
proximate to found a duty of care, it must follow that the legal incidents of a
contractual relationship are imported into it. This is a non-sequitur. The
expression “equivalent to contract” originates in the speech of Lord Shaw in <i>Nocton
v Lord Ashburton</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1914/31.html">[1914] AC 932</a>, 971-972. He used it to describe any kind of
relationship which gave rise to a duty to give information or advice, and hence
to liability for giving it negligently. The phrase was adopted by Lord Devlin
in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, at pp 528-529, and has passed into common currency: see
in particular <i>Smith v Bush</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/1.html">[1990] 1 AC 831</a>, 846 (Lord Templeman), <i>Henderson
v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1994/5.html">[1995] 2 AC 145</a>, 181 (Lord Goff), <i>Spring v
Guardian Assurance plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1994/7.html">[1995] 2 AC 296</a>, 324 (Lord Goff). It serves (i) as
an allegory of proximity, to describe a case where a service is performed for a
person pursuant to a relationship which would be contractual if there were
consideration passing from that person; and (ii) as an explanation of why it is
appropriate to award a purely economic loss as damages for negligence in the
course of such a relationship. But it does not follow from the fact that a
non-contractual relationship between two parties is as proximate as a
contractual relationship, that it is legally the same as a contractual
relationship or involves all of the same legal incidents.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the relationship between a person dealing with another and the
latter’s undisclosed principal is not at all analogous to the kind of
relationship which will give rise to a duty of care. Whether a relationship is
sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care is essentially a question
of fact from which the law draws certain conclusions. The liability of a
contracting party to his counterparty’s undisclosed principal, however, is not
a legal conclusion from any factual relationship between them. It is a purely
legal construct. The whole point about the law relating to undisclosed
principals is that a person may be brought into contractual relations with some
one with whom he has no factual relationship at all. As Lord Lloyd of Berwick
observed in <i>Siu Yin Kwan v Eastern Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1994] 2 AC 199,
207F-G, the doctrine “runs counter to fundamental principles of privity of
contract”. Such a relationship is by definition not proximate. Nor is it in any
relevant sense voluntary or consensual so as to give rise to an assumption of responsibility.
It has none of the features which were held in <i>Caparo</i> to be necessary to
bring the claimant into proximity with the defendant.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, the appellant’s submission would require one to import into the
law of tort just one aspect of the law relating to undisclosed principals. But
in fact the law in this area is a complex bundle of interrelated rights and
liabilities most of which are entirely inapposite to the law of tort. The
relationship between A and B’s undisclosed principal may not be consensual, but
it is at least mutual. The undisclosed principal may not only sue but be sued
on the contract. A may elect to sue the agent. If A is sued by the undisclosed
principal, he may take any defences which would have been available to him as against
B. But in the absence of a true contract there would be no corresponding
mutuality in tort.</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>It is impossible to feel much sympathy for BNL given the circumstances
in which they came to give a favourable credit reference for some one with whom
they appear to have had no relevant dealings. But they had no reason to suppose
that Burlington was acting for some one else, and they knew nothing of the
Playboy Club. In those circumstances, it is plain that they did not voluntarily
assume any responsibility to the Club. It may well be, since they knew nothing
of Burlington either, that they were indifferent to whom they were dealing
with. But the fact that a representor may have been equally willing to assume a
duty to some one else does not mean that he can be treated as if he had done
so.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>I agree with the judgment which has been prepared by Lord Sumption. But
one can, as he observes in para 16, have little sympathy for BNL; and the Club
has suffered significant loss in undoubted reliance on BNL’s negligent
misrepresentation of Mr Barakat’s trustworthiness. In these circumstances, I
think that there are one or two points worth examining further in order to
identify precisely why the Club’s claim nevertheless fails.</a></p><a name="para18">

</span>BNL was prepared to make an unconditional representation of
credit-worthiness without knowing anything about Burlington Street Services Ltd
(“Burlington”). And all it knew about the context was, in Burlington’s words,
that Burlington was seeking its opinion as to “the means and standing of …
Hassan Barakat … and his “trustworthiness to meet a financial commitment to the
extent of [£1.6m] at any one time”, or, in the words of NatWest, passing on
Burlington’s request, its “opinion of the character and standing of Hassan
Barakat” … and trustworthiness in the way of business to the extent of [£1.6m]
at any one time. In response, BNL, without further enquiry, represented that Mr
Barakat was trustworthy to the extent of £1.6m “in any one week”, adding “This
information is given in strict confidential [sic]”.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>Passages can be found in authority where courts have used language
suggesting that, for a duty of care to arise in tort in respect of a
representation, (a) not only must the claimant be a specific person or within a
group to whom responsibility may be said to have been undertaken, but (b) the
purpose for which the representation is required must be “specifically in
connection with a particular transaction or transactions of a particular kind”
or must, “whether particularly specified or generally described”, be “made
known, either actually or inferentially”, to the representor: see eg per Lord
Bridge and Lord Oliver in <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html">[1990] 2 AC 605</a>, 620-621 and 638, cited by Lord Sumption in his paras 8 and 9.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>BNL has argued that the Club’s claim must fail because it satisfies
neither of the elements (a) and (b) suggested by these passages. The Court of
Appeal </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/457.html">[2016] 1 WLR 3169</a> focused on element (a), although two sentences in para
19 of Longmore LJ’s judgment may also indicate that the Court saw the claim as
failing because neither element was satisfied. Longmore LJ said in particular:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the present case the customer
was identified by name as Burlington and the true purpose of the reference (for
a gambling club) was not revealed. In these circumstances there cannot, to my
mind, be an assumption of responsibility to the Club (rather than to
Burlington) or indeed a responsibility for its use by the Club in trusting Mr
Barakat in his gambling activities (a purpose of which the Bank was unaware).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not consider that this claim should fail for want of communication
of the purpose or kind of purpose for which an assessment of trustworthiness
was required. Had Burlington been the operator of the gambling club and
suffered the loss, it should have succeeded. On the face of it, BNL was
prepared, without further enquiry, to take the open risk of exposure to the
tune of up to £1.6m in any one week whatever “financial commitment” or
“business” to that tune was intended. There is no reason in principle why a
duty of care should not arise in relation to so unspecific a purpose, provided
(as is here clear) that the representation was requested and given in terms
showing that it was intended to be and would be relied on. The decision in <i>Caparo
</i>does not exclude liability on this basis. <i>Caparo </i>turned on the
statutory purpose of an audit being to enable shareholders to exercise their
class rights in general meeting, rather than to enable individual shareholders
to buy more shares in the company (unless of course the auditors specifically
agreed to extend the use of their audit report to such a use).</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The only contrary argument regarding purpose has to be that gambling is
so unusual and risky a “financial commitment” in Burlington’s terms, or
“business” in NatWest’s terms, that it must be excluded from what was
objectively and reasonably covered by the representation sought and made. But
many other high risk businesses other than gambling can be contemplated, eg
trading in derivatives or on margin. BNL was evidently prepared to take the
risk of all or any of these. So I would not be inclined to accept that
argument, in a context where the bank showed absolutely no interest in the
nature of the proposed commitment(s) or the level of risk involved.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore dismiss the claim only because element (a) is not
satisfied. The representation was directed simply and solely to Burlington. It
is true that, so far as appears, BNL was probably as uninterested in Burlington
and its identity as it was in the nature and purpose of the intended financial
commitment. But the representation was, objectively, requested by Burlington
alone and, objectively, confined in its making to Burlington. To my mind, this
consideration is strengthened by the notation “This information is given in
strict confidential” in BNL’s representation mail.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Had the representation been made, expressly or impliedly, for the
benefit of an unnamed (rather than an entirely undisclosed) principal or client
of Burlington, the case would have paralleled <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v
Heller &amp; Partners Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html">[1964] AC 465</a>, and the claim should then have
succeeded. Had it been made, expressly or impliedly, for the benefit of any
principal or client of Burlington, to which Burlington might make it available,
the same would have applied. BNL would then have undertaken an open exposure,
as it did in my view in relation to the purpose for which the representation as
to trustworthiness was sought.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Lord Sumption’s disposal of the ingenious and
well-presented submission that, as the Club could have intervened to rely on
the representation had consideration been furnished for it to BNL, so the Court
should recognise the existence for tortious purposes of a relationship akin to
contract, in the absence of any consideration. The right of an undisclosed
principal to intervene in contract is not easy to rationalise, but it does not
rest or bear on proximity for tortious purposes. It is true that it follows
from this that contributory fault will not be available as a response to a claim
by an undisclosed principal relying on a representation for which consideration
has been given - since there will be no concurrency of contractual and tortious
liability: see <i>Vesta v Butcher </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1989/5.html">[1989] AC 852</a>, CA. But the oddity here is
again, if anything, the existence of the right to intervene, or the limitations
of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, not the absence of a
relationship of duty of care.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, additional to those given by Lord Sumption, and
tempting though the thought is that BNL is very lucky to avoid liability to the
Club, I agree that the appeal falls to be dismissed.</a></p><a name="para27">
