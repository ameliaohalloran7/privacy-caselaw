</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As Lord Hewart CJ famously
declared, in <i>R v Sussex Magistrates, Ex p McCarthy </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1923/1.html">[1924] 1 KB 256</a>, 259,
“… it is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that
justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen
to be done”. That was in the context of an appearance of bias, but the
principle is of broader application. With only a few exceptions, our courts sit
in public, not only that justice be done but that justice may be seen to be
done. But whereas in the olden days civil proceedings were dominated by the
spoken word - oral evidence and oral argument, followed by an oral judgment,
which anyone in the court room could hear, these days civil proceedings
generate a great deal of written material - statements of case, witness
statements, and the documents exhibited to them, documents disclosed by each
party, skeleton arguments and written submissions, leading eventually to a
written judgment. It is standard practice to collect all the written material
which is likely to be relevant in a hearing into a “bundle” - which may range
from a single ring binder to many, many volumes of lever arch files.
Increasingly, these bundles may be digitised and presented electronically,
either instead of or as well as in hard copy.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This case is about how much of the
written material placed before the court in a civil action should be accessible
to people who are not parties to the proceedings and how it should be made
accessible to them. It is, in short, about the extent and operation of the
principle of open justice. As Toulson LJ said, in <i>R (Guardian News and Media
Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court (Article 19 intervening) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/420.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 420</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/420.html">[2013] QB 618</a> (“<i>Guardian News and Media</i>”), at para 1:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Open justice. The words express a
principle at the heart of our system of justice and vital to the rule of law.
The rule of law is a fine concept but fine words butter no parsnips. How is the
rule of law itself to be policed? It is an age old question. <i>Quis custodiet
ipsos custodes </i>- who will guard the guards themselves? In a democracy,
where power depends on the consent of the people governed, the answer must lie
in the transparency of the legal process. Open justice lets in the light and
allows the public to scrutinise the workings of the law, for better or for
worse.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The circumstances in which this
important issue comes before the court are unusual, to say the least. Cape
Intermediate Holdings Ltd (“Cape”) is a company that was involved in the
manufacture and supply of asbestos. In January and February 2017, it was the
defendant in a six-week trial in the Queen’s Bench Division before Picken J.
The trial involved two sets of proceedings, known as the “PL claims” and the
“CDL claim”, but only the PL claims are relevant to this appeal. In essence,
these were claims brought against Cape by insurers who had written employers’
liability policies for employers. The employers had paid damages to former
employees who had contracted mesothelioma in the course of their employment.
The employers, through their insurers, then claimed a contribution from Cape on
the basis that the employees had been exposed at work to asbestos from products
manufactured by Cape. It was alleged that Cape had been negligent in the
production of asbestos insulation boards; that it knew of the risks of asbestos
and had failed to take steps to make those risks clear; indeed, that it
obscured, understated and unfairly qualified the information that it had, thus
providing false and misleading reassurance to employers and others. Cape denied
all this and alleged that the employers were solely responsible to their
employees, that it did publish relevant warnings and advice, and that any
knowledge which it had of the risks should also have been known to the
employers.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Voluminous documentation was
produced for the trial. Each set of proceedings had its own hard copy “core
bundle”, known as Bundle C, which contained the core documents obtained on
disclosure and some documents obtained from public sources. The PL core bundle
amounted to over 5,000 pages in around 17 lever arch files. In addition, there
was a joint Bundle D, only available on an electronic platform, which contained
all the disclosed documents in each set of proceedings. If it was needed to
refer to a document in Bundle D which was not in Bundle C, it could immediately
be viewed on screen, and would then be included in hard copy in Bundle C. The
intention was that Bundle C would contain all the documents referred to for the
purpose of the trial, whether in the parties’ written and oral opening and
closing submissions, or in submissions or evidence during the trial.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">After the trial had ended, but
before judgment was delivered, the PL claims were settled by a consent order
dated 14 March 2017 and sealed on 17 March 2017. The CDL claim was also settled
a month later, before judgment.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Asbestos Victims Support
Groups Forum UK (“the Forum”) is an unincorporated association providing help
and support to people who suffer from asbestos-related diseases and their
families. It is also involved in lobbying and promoting asbestos knowledge and
safety. It was not a party to either set of proceedings. On 6 April 2017, after
the settlement of the PL claims, it applied without notice, under the Civil
Procedure Rules, CPR rule 5.4C, which deals with third party access to the
“records of the court”, with a view to preserving and obtaining copies of all
the documents used at or disclosed for the trial, including the trial bundles,
as well as the trial transcripts. This was because the Forum believed that the
documents would contain valuable information about such things as the knowledge
of the asbestos industry of the dangers of asbestos, the research which the
industry and industry-related bodies had carried out, and the influence which
they had had on the Factory Inspectorate and the Health and Safety Executive in
setting standards. In the Forum’s view, the documents might assist both
claimants and defendants and also the court in understanding the issues in
asbestos-related disease claims. No particular case was identified but it was
said that they would assist in current cases.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">That same day, the Master made an
ex parte order designed to ensure that all the documents which were still at
court stayed at court and that any which had been removed were returned to the
court. She later ordered that a hard drive containing an electronic copy of
Bundle D be produced and lodged at court. After a three day hearing of the
application in October, she gave judgment in December, holding that she had
jurisdiction, either under CPR rule 5.4C(2) or at common law, to order that a
non-party be given access to all the material sought. She ordered that Mr Dring
(now acting for and on behalf of the Forum) should be provided with the hard
copy trial bundle, including the disclosure documents in Bundle C, all witness
statements, expert reports, transcripts and written submissions. She did not
order that Bundle D be provided but ordered that it be retained at court.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Cape appealed, inter alia, on the
grounds that: (1) the Master did not have jurisdiction, either under CPR rule 5.4C
or at common law, to make an order of such a broad scope; (2) to the extent
that the court did have jurisdiction to grant access, she had applied the wrong
test to the exercise of her discretion; and (3) in any event, she should have
held that the Forum failed to meet the requisite test.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appeal was transferred to the
Court of Appeal because of the importance of the issues raised. In July 2018,
that court allowed Cape’s appeal and set aside the Master’s order: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1795.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 1795</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1795.html">[2019] 1 WLR 479</a>. It held that the “records of the court” for the
purpose of the discretion to allow access under CPR rule 5.4C(2) were much more
limited than she had held. They would not normally include trial bundles, trial
witness statements, trial expert reports, trial skeleton arguments or written
submissions; or trial transcripts. Nevertheless, the court had an inherent
jurisdiction to permit a non-party to obtain (i) witness statements of
witnesses, including experts, whose statements or reports stood as evidence-in-chief
at trial and which would have been available for inspection during the trial,
under CPR rule 32.13; (ii) documents in relation to which confidentiality had
been lost under CPR rule 31.22 and which were read out in open court, or the
judge was invited to read in court or outside court, or which it was clear or
stated that the judge had read; (iii) skeleton arguments or written submissions
read by the court, provided that there is an effective public hearing at which
these were deployed; and (iv) any specific documents which it was necessary for
a non-party to inspect in order to meet the principle of open justice. But
there was no inherent jurisdiction to permit non-parties to obtain trial
bundles or documents referred to in skeleton arguments or written submissions,
or in witness statements or experts’ reports, or in open court, simply on the
basis that they had been referred to in the hearing.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">When exercising its discretion
under CPR rule 5.4C(2) or the inherent jurisdiction, the court had to balance
the non-party’s reasons for seeking disclosure against the party’s reasons for
wanting to preserve confidentiality. The court would be likely to lean in
favour of granting access if the principle of open justice is engaged and the
applicant has a legitimate interest in inspecting the documents. If the
principle of open justice is not engaged, then the court would be unlikely to
grant access unless there were strong grounds for thinking it necessary in the
interests of justice to do so (paras 127 and 129).</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Accordingly, the court ordered, in
summary: (i) that the court should provide the Forum with copies of all
statements of case, including requests for further information and answers,
apart from those listed in Appendix 1 to the order, so far as they were on the
court file and for a fee, pursuant to the right of access granted by CPR rule
5.4C(1); (ii) that Cape should provide the Forum with copies of the witness
statements, expert reports and written submissions listed in Appendix 2 to the
order; and (iii) that the application be listed before Picken J (or failing him
some other High Court Judge) to decide whether any other document sought by the
Forum fell within (ii) or (iv) in para 9 above and if so whether Cape should be
ordered to provide copies. Copying would be at the Forum’s expense. Cape was
permitted to retrieve from the court all the documents and bundles which were
not on the court file and the hard drive containing a copy of Bundle D. In
making this order, the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that clean copies
of the documents in question were available.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Cape now appeals to this court. It
argues, first, that the Court of Appeal should have limited itself to order (i)
in para 11 above; second, that the Court of Appeal was wrong to equate the
court’s inherent jurisdiction to allow access to documents with the principle
of open justice; the treatment of court documents is largely governed by the
Civil Procedure Rules and the scope of any inherent jurisdiction is very
limited; insofar as it goes any further than expressly permitted by the Rules,
it extends only to ordering provision to a non-party of copies of (a) skeleton
arguments relied on in court and (b) written submissions made by the parties in
the course of a trial (as held by the Court of Appeal in <i>GIO Personal
Investment Services Ltd v Liverpool and London Steamship Protection and
Indemnity Association Ltd (FAI General Insurance Co Ltd intervening) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/3538.html">[1999] 1 WLR 984</a> (“<i>FAI”</i>)); and third, that the Court of Appeal was wrong to
conclude that the Forum did have a relevant legitimate interest in obtaining
access to the documents; the public interest in open justice was different from
the public interest in the content of the documents involved.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Forum cross-appeals on the
ground that the Court of Appeal was wrong to limit the scope of CPR rule 5.4C
in the way that it did. Any document filed at court should be treated as part
of the court’s records for that purpose. The default position should be to
grant access to documents placed before a judge and referred to by a party at
trial unless there was a good reason not to do so. It should not be limited by
what the judge has chosen to read.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Media Lawyers Association has
intervened in the appeal to this court. It stresses that the way in which most
members of the public are able to scrutinise court proceedings is through media
reporting. The media are the eyes and ears of the public. For this, media
access to court documents is essential. The need often arises after the
proceedings have ended and judgment has been given because that is when it is
known that scrutiny is required. The media cannot be present at every hearing.
It cites, among many other apposite quotations, the famous words of Jeremy
Bentham, cited by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in the House of Lords in <i>Scott v
Scott </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1913/19.html">[1913] AC 417</a>, the leading case on open justice, at p 477,</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> “Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the

</span>What is the scope of CPR rule 5.4C(2)? Does it give the court power to
order access to all documents which have been filed, lodged or held at court,
as the Master ruled? Or is it more limited, as the Court of Appeal ruled?</p>

Rules, save in exceptional circumstances, as the appellant argues? Or does the
court have an inherent power to order access outside the Rules?</p>

documents to a non-party from court records”. For our purposes, the following
provisions are relevant:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general rule is that

or another person.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There are thus certain documents
to which a non-party has a right of access (subject to the various caveats set
out in the rule which need not concern us) and what looks at first sight like a
very broad power to allow a non-party to obtain copies of “any other document
filed by a party, or communication between the court and a party or other
person”. Hence the Forum argues that the test is filing. CPR rule 2.3 provides
that “‘filing’ in relation to a document means delivering it by post or
otherwise to the court office”. So, it is argued, any document which has been
delivered to the court office has been filed and the court may give permission
for a non-party to obtain a copy.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There are two problems with this
argument. First, the fact that filing is to be achieved in a particular way
does not mean that every document which reaches court in that same way has been
filed: the famous fallacy of the undistributed middle. The second is that the
copy is to be obtained “from the records of the court”. The Civil Procedure
Rules do not define “the records of the court”. They do not even provide what
the records of the court are to contain. Nor, so far as we are aware, does any
other legislation.</span></p>

much help. It only tells us which records are public records and what is to be
done with them. The person responsible for public records must make
arrangements to select those which ought to be permanently preserved and for
their transfer to the Public Record Office no later than 20 years after their
creation (section 3). The Lord Chancellor is the person responsible for many
court records, including those of the High Court and Court of Appeal (section
8). Section 10 and Schedule 1 define what is meant by a public record.
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 includes the records of or held in the Senior Courts
(ie the High Court and Court of Appeal) in the list of records of courts and
tribunals which are public records. We have been shown a document prepared by
Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and the Ministry of Justice, headed <i>Record
Retention and Disposition Schedule</i>. This lists how long various categories
of files and other records are to be kept. Queen’s Bench Division files, for
example, are to be destroyed after seven years. Trial bundles are to be
destroyed if not collected by the parties at the end of the hearing or on a
date agreed with the court. This is of no help in telling us what the court
files should contain.</span></p>

historical sources which indicate what the records of certain courts may from
time to time have contained, but it is clear that practice has varied. Some
indication of what the court records may currently contain is given by Practice
Direction 5A, para 4.2A of which lists the documents which a <i>party</i> may
obtain from the records of the court unless the court orders otherwise. These
include “a claim form or other statement of case together with any documents
filed with or attached to or intended by the claimant to be served with such
claim form”; “an acknowledgement of service together with any documents filed
with or attached to or intended by the party acknowledging service to be served
with such acknowledgement of service”; “an application notice”, with two
exceptions, and “any written evidence filed in relation to an application”,
with the same two exceptions; “a judgment or order made in public (whether made
at a hearing or without a hearing)”; and “a list of documents”. It does not
include witness statements for trial, experts’ reports for trial, transcripts
of hearings, or trial bundles.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The essence of a record is that it
is something which is kept. It is a permanent or long-term record of what has
happened. The institution or person whose record it is will decide which
materials need to be kept for the purposes of that institution or person.
Practice may vary over time depending on the needs of the institution. What the
court system may have found it necessary or desirable to keep in the olden days
may be different from what it now finds it necessary or desirable to keep. Thus
one would expect that the court record of any civil case would include, at the
very least, the claim form and the judgments or orders which resulted from that
claim. One would not expect that it would contain all the evidence which had
been put before the court. The court itself would have no need for that,
although the parties might. Such expectations are confirmed by the list in
Practice Direction 5A.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The “records of the court” must
therefore refer to those documents and records which the court itself keeps for
its own purposes. It cannot refer to every single document generated in
connection with a case and filed, lodged or kept for the time being at court.
It cannot depend upon how much of the material lodged at court happens still to
be there when the request is made.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">However, current practice in
relation to what is kept in the records of the court cannot determine the scope
of the court’s power to order access to case materials in particular cases. The
purposes for which court records are kept are completely different from the
purposes for which non-parties may properly be given access to court documents.
The principle of open justice is completely distinct from the practical
requirements of running a justice system. What is required for each may change
over time, but the reasons why records are kept and the reasons why access may
be granted are completely different from one another.</span></p>

are relevant to the access to documents which may be granted to non-parties.
CPR, rule 39.2 lays down the general rule that court hearings are to be in
public. Rule 39.9 provides that in any hearing the proceedings will be recorded.
Any party or other person may require a transcript (for which there will be a
fee). If the hearing was in private, a non-party can get a transcript but only
if the court so orders. A <i>Practice Direction (Audio Recordings of
Proceedings: Access)</i> [2014] 1 WLR 632 states that there is generally no
right for either a party or a non-party to listen to the recording. If they
have obtained a copy of the transcript, they can apply for permission to
listen, but this will only be granted in exceptional circumstances, save to
official law reporters. Nevertheless, the effect of rule 39.9 (which is wider
than its predecessor) is that a non-party can (at a fee) obtain a transcript of
everything that was said in court.</span></p>

file a trial bundle and Practice Direction 32, para 27.5, deals in detail with
how these are to be prepared. Nothing is said about non-parties being granted
access to them.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Rule 32 deals with evidence. If a
witness who has made a witness statement is called to give evidence, the
witness statement shall stand as his evidence in chief (rule 32.5(2)). A
“witness statement which stands as evidence in chief is open to inspection
unless the court otherwise directs during the course of the trial” (rule
32.13(1)). The considerations which might lead the court otherwise to direct
are listed as the interests of justice, the public interest, the nature of
expert medical evidence, the nature of confidential information, and the need
to protect a child or protected person (rule 32.13(3)). Rule 32.13 recognises
that the modern practice of treating a witness statement as evidence in chief
(which dates back to the <i>Report of the Review Body on Civil Justice</i>
(1988, Cm 394)) means that those observing the proceedings in court will not
know the content of that evidence unless they can inspect the statement. The
rule puts them back into the position they would have been in before that
practice was adopted.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In <i>FAI</i>, FAI applied to
inspect and obtain: copies of documents referred to in witness statements which
they had obtained under the predecessor to rule 32.13 (Rules of the Supreme
Court, Order 39, rule 2A); any written opening, skeleton argument or
submissions, to which reference was made by the judge, together with any
documents referred to in them; and any document which the judge was
specifically requested to read, which was included in any reading list, or
which was read or referred to during trial. The Court of Appeal held that RSC
Order 38, rule 2A, the predecessor to CPR, rule 5.4C(2), did not cover
documents referred to in witness statements. The purpose of using witness
statements was to encourage a “cards on the table” approach, to accelerate the
disclosure of the parties’ evidence as between themselves; it was not to enable
non-parties to obtain access to documentation which would otherwise have been
unavailable to them whether or not they had attended court. As to the inherent
jurisdiction of the court, based on the principle of open justice, the same
reasoning applied to documents referred to in court or read by the judge,
unless they had been read out in court and thus entered the public domain.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Written submissions or skeleton
arguments were a different matter. The confidence of the public in the integrity
of the judicial process must depend upon having an opportunity to understand
the issues. Until recently this had been done in an opening speech, but if the
public were deprived of that opportunity by a written opening or submissions
which were not read out, it was within the inherent jurisdiction of the court
to require that a copy be made available. Nevertheless, the court did observe,
having referred to Lord Woolf’s report, <i>Access to Justice: Final Report to
the Lord Chancellor on the Civil Justice System in England and Wales </i>(July
1996) that “It is of great importance that the beneficial saving in time and
money which it is hoped to bring about by such new procedures should not erode
the principle of open justice” (p 997).</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Indeed, Lord Woolf himself took
the same view. In <i>Barings plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/148.html">[2000] 1 WLR 2353</a>,
para 43, he said this:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As a matter of basic principle
the starting point should be that practices adopted by the courts and parties
to ensure the efficient resolution of litigation should not be allowed to
adversely affect the ability of the public to know what is happening in the
course of the proceedings.”</p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In this case, the Court of Appeal
largely adopted the approach in <i>FAI</i>, while recognising that in certain
respects the law had been developed. First, it was now apparent that the court
had inherent jurisdiction to allow access to all parties’ skeleton arguments,
not just the opening submissions, provided there was an effective public
hearing at which they were deployed (see <i>Law Debenture Trust Corpn (Channel
Islands) Ltd v Lexington Insurance Co </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2003/2297.html">[2003] EWHC 2297 (Comm)</a>; (2003) NLJ
1551), and the same would apply to other advocates’ documents provided to the
court to assist its understanding of the case, such as chronologies, dramatis
personae, reading lists and written closing submissions (para 92). Second,
although CPR rule 32.13 is limited to access during the trial, there was no
reason why access to witness statements taken as evidence in chief should not
be allowed under the inherent jurisdiction after the trial (para 95). Third,
what applies to witness statements should also apply to experts’ reports which
are treated as their evidence in chief (para 96). This did not extend to
documents exhibited to witness statements or experts’ reports unless it was not
possible to understand the statement or report without sight of a particular
document (para 100).</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, developments since <i>FAI </i>also meant that it was within the
inherent jurisdiction to allow access to “documents read or treated as read in
open court” (para 107). This should be limited to documents which are read out
in open court; documents which the judge is invited to read in open court;
documents which the judge is specifically invited to read outside court; and
documents which it is clear or stated that the judge has read (para 108). These
were all documents which were likely to have been read out in open court had
the trial been conducted orally. Furthermore, the rule that parties may only
use documents obtained on disclosure for the purpose of the proceedings in
which they are disclosed does not apply to documents which have been “read to
or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in public”
unless the court prohibits or limits their use (CPR rule 31.22). However, the
mere fact that a document had been referred to in court did not mean that it
would have been read out had the trial been conducted wholly orally or that
sight of it is necessary in order to understand or scrutinise the proceedings (para
109). So, as in <i>FAI</i>, the court did not consider that the inherent
jurisdiction extended to granting access “simply on the basis that it has been
referred to in open court” (para 109).</p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The decisions of the Court of
Appeal in <i>FAI </i>and in this case are not the only cases in which the
courts have accepted that they have an inherent jurisdiction to allow access to
materials used in the course of court proceedings and that the rationale for
doing so is the constitutional principle of open justice. That this is so is
made even plainer by some recent cases of high authority.</span></p>

unenviable task of trying to reconcile the very different approaches taken by
that court in <i>FAI </i>and <i>Guardian News and Media. </i>This court has the
great advantage of being able to consider the issues from the vantage point of
principle rather than the detailed decisions which have been reached by the
courts below. There can be no doubt at all that the court rules are not
exhaustive of the circumstances in which non-parties may be given access to
court documents. They are a minimum and of course it is for a person seeking to
persuade the court to allow access outside the rules to show a good case for
doing so. However, case after case has recognised that the guiding principle is
the need for justice to be done in the open and that courts at all levels have
an inherent jurisdiction to allow access in accordance with that principle.
Furthermore, the open justice principle is applicable throughout the United
Kingdom, even though the court rules may be different.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This was plainly recognised in <i>Guardian
News and Media</i>. A District Judge had ordered two British citizens to be
extradited to the USA. The Guardian newspaper applied to the District Judge to
inspect and take copies of affidavits, witness statements, written arguments
and correspondence, supplied to the judge for the purpose of the extradition
hearings, referred to during the course of the hearings but not read out in
open court. The judge held that she had no power to allow this and the
Divisional Court agreed. In a comprehensive judgment, Toulson LJ, with whom
both Hooper LJ and Lord Neuberger MR agreed, held that she did.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The requirements of open justice
applied to all tribunals exercising the judicial power of the state. The fact
that magistrates’ courts were created by statute was neither here nor there
(para 70). The decisions of the House of Lords in <i>Scott v Scott </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1913/19.html">[1913] AC 417</a>, and of the Court of Appeal in <i>FAI</i>, and <i>R v Howell </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2003/486.html">[2003] EWCA Crim 486</a> - respectively a family, civil and criminal case - were
illustrations of the jurisdiction of the court to decide what open justice
required (para 71). Hence the principles established in <i>Guardian News and
Media </i>cannot be confined to criminal cases. They were clearly meant to
apply across the board. Nor has anyone suggested why the jurisdiction in
criminal cases should be wider than that in civil. More to the point, they have
since been approved by this court.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">So what were those principles? The
purpose of open justice “is not simply to deter impropriety or sloppiness by
the judge hearing the case. It is wider. It is to enable the public to
understand and scrutinise the justice system of which the courts are the
administrators” (para 79). The practice of the courts was not frozen (para 80).
In <i>FAI</i>, for example, issues of informing the public about matters of
general public interest did not arise (para 81). In earlier cases, it had been
recognised, principally by Lord Scarman and Lord Simon of Glaisdale
(dissenting) in <i>Home Office v</i> <i>Harman </i>[1983] 1 AC 280, 316,<i> </i>and
by Lord Bingham in <i>SmithKline Beecham Biologicals SA v Connaught
Laboratories Inc </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1781.html">[1999] 4 All ER 498</a>, p 512, that the practice of receiving
evidence without its being read in open court “has the side effect of making
the proceedings less intelligible to the press and the public”. Lord Bingham
had contemplated that public access to documents referred to in open court
might be necessary “to avoid too wide a gap between what has in theory, and
what has in practice, passed into the public domain”. The time had come to
acknowledge that public access to documents referred to in open court was
necessary (para 83). Requiring them to be read out would be to defeat the
purpose of making hearings more efficient. Stating that they should be treated
as if read out was merely a formal device for allowing access. It was
unnecessary. Toulson LJ was unimpressed by the suggestion that there would be
practical problems, given that the Criminal Procedure Rules 2011, in rule 5.8,
provided, not only that there was certain (limited) information about a
criminal case which the court officer was bound to supply, but also that, if
the court so directs, the officer could supply “other information” about the
case orally and allow the applicant to inspect or copy a document containing
information about the case (para 84). But it was the common law, not the rule,
which created the court’s power; the rule simply provided a practical procedure
for implementing it.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Hence “[i]n a case where documents
have been placed before a judge and referred to in the course of proceedings …
the default position should be that access should be permitted on the open
justice principle; and where access is sought for a proper journalistic purpose
the case for allowing it will be particularly strong”. In evaluating the
grounds for opposing access, the court would have to carry out a fact-specific
proportionality exercise. “Central to the court’s evaluation will be the purpose
of the open justice principle, the potential value of the material in advancing
that purpose and, conversely, any risk of harm which access to the documents
may cause to the legitimate interests of others” (para 85).</span></p>

enable public scrutiny of the way in which courts decide cases - to hold the
judges to account for the decisions they make and to enable the public to have
confidence that they are doing their job properly. In <i>A v British
Broadcasting Corpn</i>, Lord Reed reminded us of the comment of Lord Shaw of
Dunfermline, in <i>Scott v Scott </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1913/19.html">[1913] AC 417</a>, 475, that the two Acts of
the Scottish Parliament passed in 1693 requiring that both civil and criminal
cases be heard “with open doors”, “bore testimony to a determination to secure
civil liberties against the judges as well as against the Crown” (para 24).</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">But the second goes beyond the
policing of individual courts and judges. It is to enable the public to
understand how the justice system works and why decisions are taken. For this
they have to be in a position to understand the issues and the evidence adduced
in support of the parties’ cases. In the olden days, as has often been said,
the general practice was that all the argument and the evidence was placed
before the court orally. Documents would be read out. The modern practice is
quite different. Much more of the argument and evidence is reduced into writing
before the hearing takes place. Often, documents are not read out. It is
difficult, if not impossible, in many cases, especially complicated civil
cases, to know what is going on unless you have access to the written material.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:
13.0pt">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It was held in <i>Guardian News
and Media</i> that the default position is that the public should be allowed
access, not only to the parties’ written submissions and arguments, but also to
the documents which have been placed before the court and referred to during
the hearing. It follows that it should not be limited to those which the judge
has been asked to read or has said that he has read. One object of the exercise
is to enable the observer to relate what the judge has done or decided to the
material which was before him. It is not impossible, though it must be rare,
that the judge has forgotten or ignored some important piece of information
which was before him. If access is limited to what the judge has actually read,
then the less conscientious the judge, the less transparent is his or her
decision.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">However, although the court has
the power to allow access, the applicant has no right to be granted it (save to
the extent that the rules grant such a right). It is for the person seeking
access to explain why he seeks it and how granting him access will advance the
open justice principle. In this respect it may well be that the media are
better placed than others to demonstrate a good reason for seeking access. But
there are others who may be able to show a legitimate interest in doing so. As
was said in both <i>Kennedy</i>, at para 113,<i> </i>and <i>A v British
Broadcasting Corpn</i>, at para 41, the court has to carry out a fact-specific
balancing exercise. On the one hand will be “the purpose of the open justice
principle and the potential value of the information in question in advancing
that purpose”.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:
13.0pt">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand will be “any
risk of harm which its disclosure may cause to the maintenance of an effective
judicial process or to the legitimate interests of others”. There may be very
good reasons for denying access. The most obvious ones are national security,
the protection of the interests of children or mentally disabled adults, the
protection of privacy interests more generally, and the protection of trade
secrets and commercial confidentiality. In civil cases, a party may be
compelled to disclose documents to the other side which remain confidential
unless and until they are deployed for the purpose of the proceedings. But even
then there may be good reasons for preserving their confidentiality, for
example, in a patent case.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:
13.0pt">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Also relevant must be the
practicalities and the proportionality of granting the request. It is highly
desirable that the application is made during the trial when the material is
still readily available, the parties are before the court and the trial judge
is in day to day control of the court process. The non-party who seeks access
will be expected to pay the reasonable costs of granting that access. People
who seek access after the proceedings are over may find that it is not
practicable to provide the material because the court will probably not have
retained it and the parties may not have done so. Even if they have, the
burdens placed on the parties in identifying and retrieving the material may be
out of all proportion to benefits to the open justice principle, and the burden
placed upon the trial judge in deciding what disclosure should be made may have
become much harder, or more time-consuming, to discharge. On the other hand,
increasing digitisation of court materials may eventually make this easier. In
short, non-parties should not seek access unless they can show a good reason
why this will advance the open justice principle, that there are no
countervailing principles of the sort outlined earlier, which may be stronger
after the proceedings have come to an end, and that granting the request will
not be impracticable or disproportionate.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is, however, appropriate to add
a comment about trial bundles. Trial bundles are now generally required. They
are compilations of copies of what are likely to be the relevant materials -
the pleadings, the parties’ submissions, the witness statements and exhibits,
and some of the documents disclosed. They are provided for the convenience of
the parties and the court. To that end, the court, the advocates and others
involved in the case may flag, mark or annotate their copies of the bundle as
an aide memoire. But the bundle is not the evidence or the documents in the
case. There can be no question of ordering disclosure of a marked up bundle
without the consent of the person holding it. A clean copy of the bundle, if
still available, may in fact be the most practicable way of affording a
non-party access to the material in question, but that is for the court hearing
the application to decide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;page-break-after:avoid"><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Application to this case</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Cape argues that the Court of
Appeal did not have jurisdiction to make the order that it did, not that if it
did have jurisdiction the order was wrong in principle. The Forum argues that
the court should have made a wider order under CPR rule 5.4C(2). Both are, in our
view, incorrect. The Court of Appeal not only had jurisdiction to make the
order that it did, but also had jurisdiction to make a wider order if it were
right so to do. On the other hand, the basis of making any wider order is the
inherent jurisdiction in support of the open justice principle, not the Civil
Procedure Rules, CPR rule 5.4C(2). The principles governing the exercise of
that jurisdiction are those laid down in <i>Guardian News and Media</i>, as
explained by this court in <i>Kennedy</i>,<i> A v British Broadcasting Corpn</i>
and this case<i>.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In those circumstances, as the
Court of Appeal took a narrower view, both of the jurisdiction and the
applicable principles, it would be tempting to send the whole matter back to a
High Court judge, preferably Picken J, so that he can decide it on the basis of
the principles enunciated by this court. However, Cape has chosen to attack the
order made by the Court of Appeal, not on its merits, but on a narrow view of
the court’s jurisdiction. Nor has it set up any counter-vailing rights of its
own. In those circumstances, there seems no realistic possibility of the judge
making a more limited order than did the Court of Appeal. We therefore order
that paras 4 and 7 of the Court of Appeal order (corresponding to points (i)
and (ii) in para 11 above) stand. But we would replace paragraph 8
(corresponding with point (iii)) with an order that the application be listed
before Picken J (or, if that is not possible, another High Court Judge) to
determine whether the court should require the appellant to provide a copy of
any other document placed before the judge and referred to in the course of the
trial to the respondent (at the respondent’s expense) in accordance with the
principles laid down by this court.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;page-break-after:avoid"><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Postscript</span></i></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">We would urge the bodies
responsible for framing the court rules in each part of the United Kingdom to
give consideration to the questions of principle and practice raised by this
case. About the importance and universality of the principles of open justice
there can be no argument. But we are conscious that these issues were raised in
unusual circumstances, after the end of the trial, but where clean copies of
the documents were still available. We have heard no argument on the extent of
any continuing obligation of the parties to co-operate with the court in
furthering the open justice principle once the proceedings are over. This and
the other practical questions touched on above are more suitable for resolution
through a consultative process in which all interests are represented than
through the prism of an individual case.</span></p>
