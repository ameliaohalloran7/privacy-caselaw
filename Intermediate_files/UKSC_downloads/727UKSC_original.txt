<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issuers and acquirers join the Visa and/or Mastercard schemes, and agree to abide by the rules of the schemes.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A cardholder contracts with an issuer, which agrees to provide the cardholder with a Visa or Mastercard debit or credit card, and agrees the terms on which they may use the card to buy goods or services from merchants.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those terms may include a fee payable by the cardholder to the issuer for the use of the card, the interest rate applicable to the provision of credit, and incentives or rewards payable by the issuer to the cardholder for holding or using the card (such as airmiles, cashback on transactions, or travel insurance).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merchants who wish to accept payment cards under the scheme contract with an acquirer, which agrees to provide services to the merchant enabling the acceptance of the cards, in consideration of a fee, known as the merchant service charge (“the MSC”). The acquirer receives payment from the issuer to settle a transaction entered into between cardholder and merchant, and passes the payment on to the merchant, less the MSC.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MSC is negotiated between the acquirer and the merchant. Typically, it is set at a level that reflects the size and bargaining power of the merchant, the level of the acquirer’s costs (including scheme fees payable to Visa and Mastercard, and any interchange fees payable by the acquirer to issuers), and the acquirer’s margin.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(vi)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scheme rules require that, whenever a cardholder uses a payment card to make a purchase from a merchant, the cardholder’s issuer must make a payment to the merchant’s acquirer to settle the transaction.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(vii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Visa and Mastercard scheme rules make provision for the terms on which issuers and acquirers (who are members of the scheme) are to deal with each other, in the absence of any different bilateral agreement made between them. These terms include issuers and acquirers settling transactions at the face value of the transaction (“settlement at par” or, as it is sometimes referred to, “prohibition on ex post pricing”) and also provide for the payment of an interchange fee on each transaction.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(viii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under both the Visa and Mastercard schemes, the default interchange fee (ie the MIF) which is payable by the acquirer to the issuer on each transaction is expressed either as a percentage of the value of the transaction, or as a flat figure in pence for each transaction. Different MIFs apply to different types of transaction (such as contactless payments, or payments made where the card is not present, including internet payments). Different MIFs also apply to transactions depending on whether the issuer and acquirer are based in the same state/region or different states/regions.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(ix)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the Visa and Mastercard schemes, issuers and acquirers are not required to contract on the basis of the MIF. Under the rules, they are free to enter into bilateral agreements with different terms. In practice, however, issuers and acquirers do contract on the basis of the MIF, as both trial judges below found.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para10">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popplewell J stated in <i>Asda Stores Ltd v Mastercard Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2017/93.html">[2017] EWHC 93 (Comm)</a>; [2017] 4 CMLR 32, para 9 in relation to the Mastercard scheme:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">“Interchange fees can in theory be agreed bilaterally between issuers and acquirers. In practice this is not how the interchange fee is determined. Under the Scheme Rules (Rule 8.3), MasterCard sets the interchange fees which are to apply compulsorily in default of bilateral agreements. These are the multilateral interchange fees or ‘MIFs’. In practice there are no material bilateral agreements, and so the MIF always applies. This is not surprising: in a putative bilateral negotiation between an issuer and an acquirer the issuer has no incentive to accept less than the default MIF and the acquirer no incentive to offer more.”</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phillips J stated in <i>Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd v Visa Europe Services LLC </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2017/3047.html">[2017] EWHC 3047 (Comm)</a>; [2018] 2 All ER 611, para 102 in relation to the Visa scheme:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">“Although a MIF is, in theory, only a default provision applying in the absence of agreement, it was common ground that no bilateral agreements as to Interchange Fees are in fact made in the UK market. The reason for that result is also common ground and is obvious: Issuers have no need or incentive to agree a lower fee than the MIF and Acquirers have no need or incentive to agree to a higher fee. Both sides of the negotiation have the certainty that transactions will, in the absence of agreement, proceed on the basis of settlement at par plus an Interchange Fee set at the level of the MIF, so neither has a reason to depart from that position and certainly no incentive to incur the significant costs of entering negotiations with multiple counterparties in the (probably forlorn) hope of persuading one or more of them to agree a position which deviated from the default. As all Acquirers are in the same position, Merchants have no ability to negotiate with them as to the MIF element of the MSC, which is passed on in full. Witnesses called by each of the Merchants (12 in total) gave evidence that their respective Acquirers refused to negotiate the MIF element of their charge, treating it as a pass-through cost set by the Scheme.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(x)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For most of the claim period, the MIF typically accounted for some 90% of the MSC. Acquirers pass on all of the MIF, and the scheme fee, to merchants through the MSC, with negotiation between acquirers and merchants in respect of the MSC being limited to the level of the acquirer’s margin.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present proceedings, the MIFs at issue flow from the acquirer to the issuer. In other words, they involve a deduction from the payment that the issuer makes to the acquirer to settle the transaction. This is sometimes referred to as a “positive MIF”. However, this is not universally the case for schemes of this kind. In principle, interchange fees could flow in the opposite direction (ie be added to the payment made by the issuer to the acquirer). There are some four-party payment card schemes which operate on that basis. This is sometimes referred to as a “negative MIF”. Other schemes operate on the basis that, in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the issuer and acquirer, the issuer must settle the transaction at par without the deduction of an interchange fee.</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“156.&nbsp; ...They [the MIFs] imposed a floor below which the MSC could not fall, because acquirers had to pay at least that much to issuers and had to recoup it from the merchants, which in turn led to higher prices charged by acquirers to merchants through the MSC than if the MIF were lower or zero. Such a floor restricts competition because it interferes with the ability of acquirers to compete for merchants’ business by offering MSCs below such floor. It is no different in kind from a collective agreement by manufacturers to maintain inflated wholesale prices, which prevents wholesalers competing on the retail market below those prices.”</p>

His main reason for doing so is set out at para 156 of the Visa restriction judgment:</a></p><a name="para46"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“156.&nbsp; … the situation is exactly the same at any lower level of MIF, including a zero MIF or its equivalent, a no-MIF/default SAP [settlement at par] counterfactual. At that lower level, the default settlement rule still provides a default level of Interchange Fee, and therefore (because of the lack of competitive pressure to depart from that default) both a floor and a ceiling for that fee. The only difference is the level. Popplewell J rejected that argument in the Asda Judgment, stating at para 160 that ‘in a no MIF<i> </i>counterfactual the alleged vice is not the same as the actual: there is no floor.’ However, a zero MIF or no-MIF/default SAP counterfactual most certainly <i>does</i> give rise to a ‘floor’, both in economic terms and as a matter of logic, particularly in the context of a two-sided market: it prevents the possibility of market forces driving the MIF to a negative level (equivalent to a premium on settling the transaction price). As I have mentioned above, that is not merely a theoretical possibility, as all the expert economists recognised ...”</p>

It stated that this was not a decision from which the Court “either can or should depart”. Its reasoning is summarised at paras 185-186 of the judgment:</a></p><a name="para47"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para47">“185.&nbsp; Our conclusions on the primary article 101(1) issue can be summarised quite shortly. The correct counterfactual for schemes like the MasterCard and Visa schemes before us was identified by the [Court of Justice’s] decision. It was ‘no default MIF’ and a prohibition on ex post pricing (or a settlement at par rule). The relevant counterfactual has to be likely and realistic in the actual context (see the <i>O2 Germany GmbH &amp; Co OHG</i> case </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/T32803.html">[2006] ECR II-1231</a>, paras 68-71 [<i>O2 Germany v Commission </i>(Case T-328/03)] and the [Court of Justice’s] decision, para 169), but for schemes of this kind, the [Court of Justice] has decided that that test is satisfied.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">186.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The [Court of Justice’s] decision also made clear at para 195 that MasterCard’s MIFs, which resulted in higher prices, limited the pressure which merchants could exert on acquiring banks, resulting in a reduction in competition between acquirers as regards the amount of the merchants’ service charge. This is not a decision from which this court either can or should depart. It answers the schemes’ argument that, whether as a matter of evidence or not, the competitive process will not differ in the counterfactual. The default MIFs may be a transparent common cost, which is passed on by acquirers to merchants, and which does not figure in the negotiations between them, but it does not follow that acquirers none the less compete as strongly for merchants’ business in relation to the acquirer’s margin and the additional services they offer, as they would in the absence of the default MIFs.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The MIF in MasterCard’s scheme restricts competition between acquiring banks by inflating the base on which acquiring banks set charges to merchants and thereby setting a floor under the merchant fee. In the absence of the multilateral interchange fee the merchant fees set by acquiring banks would be lower.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“MasterCard’s MIF constitutes a restriction of price competition in the acquiring markets. In the absence of a bilateral agreement, the multilateral ‘default’ rule fixes the level of the interchange fee rate for all acquiring banks alike, thereby inflating the base on which acquiring banks set charges to merchants. Prices set by acquiring banks would be lower in the absence of this rule and in the presence of a rule that prohibits ex post pricing. The MasterCard MIF therefore creates an artificial cost base that is common for all acquirers and the merchant fee will typically reflect the costs of the MIF. This leads to a restriction of price competition between acquiring banks to the detriment of merchants (and subsequent purchasers).”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is further explained at recital 448 as follows:</a></p><a name="para52"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… The decisive question is whether in the absence of the MIF the prices acquirers charge to merchants at large would be lower. This is the case, because the price each individual bank could charge to merchants would be fully determined by competition rather than to a large extent by a collective decision among (or on behalf of) the banks.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At recitals 455 to 460 the Commission addressed the argument of Mastercard and Visa (who had been allowed to participate in the proceedings) that the MIF was not a restriction because its effect would be like an excise tax. This argument is recorded at recital 219 in the following terms:</a></p><a name="para53"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“At the oral hearing Visa’s expert also argued that it was hard to imagine how a multilaterally set interchange fee could possibly restrict competition between acquiring banks. Competition among acquirers could not be stronger with ‘<i>at par</i>’ clearing than with a MIF, just as it would be hard to assume that breweries would compete more keenly if one scraps excise taxes.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is essentially the same argument as that advanced successfully by Visa before Phillips J and again on this appeal. In summary, in a counterfactual with settlement at par (equivalent to a zero rated MIF) there is no process of competition as to that default term of settlement, just as there would not be if there was a MIF, a common and transparent cost which is also a default term of settlement, not a price or charge. In both the factual scenario and the counterfactual, competition is limited to the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and mark up. There is accordingly no difference in the competitive process and no restriction on competition (“the zero MIF argument”).</a></p><a name="para54"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission rejected this argument for the following reasons:</a></p><a name="para55"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“455.&nbsp; MasterCard puts forward that the interchange fee does not favour a particular acquirer or type of acquirer over other acquirers/types of acquirers. ‘<i>The interchange fee is a common identical cost, borne by all acquirers, that does not influence price competition between acquirers in terms of determining the level of MSCs</i>’. Visa’s expert raised a similar argument at the oral hearing by comparing the MIF to an excise tax.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">457.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … even if one were to qualify a MIF as a kind of ‘excise tax’ this is no reason why the MIF should fall outside article 81(1) of the Treaty [now article 101(1) TFEU]. The collective act of competing undertakings to raise charges for consumers is subject to the prohibition of article 81(1) of the Treaty.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">458.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the concept of a restriction of competition within the meaning of article 81(1) of the Treaty had to be interpreted as MasterCard suggests, then article 81(1) of the Treaty would be entirely deprived of its <i>effet utile</i>. The MasterCard MIF not only creates an (artificial) common cost for acquirers and thereby sets a floor for the fees each acquirer charges to merchants. Acquirers also <i>know </i>precisely that all of their competitors pay the very same fees. The price floor <i>and </i>the transparency of it to all suppliers involved (that is to say the knowledge of each acquirer about the commonality of the MIF for all other acquirers in the MasterCard scheme) eliminate an element of uncertainty.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">459.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of MasterCard’s MIF, the prices acquirers charge to merchants would not take into account the artificial cost base of the MIF and would only be set taking into account the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and his mark up.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">460.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statements of retailers demonstrate that they would be in a position to exert that pressure if acquirers were not able to refer to interchange fee as the ‘starting point’ (that is to say, as the floor) for negotiating the MSC. This is because without a default that fixes an interchange fee rate in the absence of a bilateral agreement, merchants could shop around to contract with the acquirer who incurs the lowest interchange costs.<sup>517</sup> Acquirers who bilaterally agree to pay relatively high interchange fees to issuers would ultimately not remain competitive, as other acquirers could undercut their merchant fees by refusing to enter into bilateral agreements with issuers or by agreeing on relatively lower interchange fees. The uncertainty of each individual acquirer about the level of interchange fees which competitors bilaterally agree to pay to issuers would exercise a constraint on acquirers. In the long run this process can be expected to lead to the establishment of inter-bank claims and debts at the face value of the payment that is without deducting any interchange fees. A multilateral rule that by default sets a certain interchange fee rate in the absence of bilateral negotiations prevents this competitive process. In the absence of such a rule (and in the presence of a prohibition of ex post pricing) acquiring banks would eventually end up setting their MSCs merely by taking into account their own marginal cost plus a certain mark up.”</p>

Recital 459 bears repetition; it states:</a></p><a name="para74"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the absence of MasterCard’s MIF, the prices acquirers charge to merchants would not take into account the artificial cost base of the MIF and would only be set taking into account the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and his mark up.”</p>

It was contrasting the position where that charge is negotiated by reference to a minimum price floor set by the MIF and one where it is negotiated by reference only to the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and his mark up - ie between a situation in which the charge is only partly determined by competition and one in which it is fully determined by competition. In the latter situation the merchants have the ability to force down the charge to the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and his mark up and to negotiate on that basis. This is the “pressure” which is referred to in recital 460 of the decision. This is made clear by the reference in the first sentence of recital 460 to “that” pressure - ie the pressure referred to in recital 459.</a></p><a name="para75">

The transient nature of such a competitive process shows that the existence of such a process cannot have been integral to the Commission’s decision that there was a restriction on competition. This is further borne out by footnote 517 in which the Commission stated that in the counterfactual “banks may or may not enter into bilateral agreements on interchange fees”, thereby making it clear that such agreements were not essential to its reasoning.</a></p><a name="para76">

In para 143 the General Court rejected the zero MIF argument and held that since the MIF sets a minimum price floor for the MSC (which is not determined by competition) “it necessarily follows that the MIF has effects restrictive of competition”. This is the context in which the “pressure” referred to in the next sentence falls to be considered. The consequence of the minimum price floor set by the MIF is that such pressure is limited to only part of the MSC - ie that relating to the acquirer’s individual marginal cost and mark up (in the present case about 10% of the MSC).</a></p><a name="para77">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, as regards the acquiring market in Hungary, even assuming that the MIF Agreement had inter alia as its objective the fixing of a minimum threshold applicable to the service charges, the Court has not been provided with sufficient information to establish that that agreement posed a sufficient degree of harm to competition on that market for a restriction of competition ‘by object’ to be found to exist.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, in the present instance, subject to those verifications, it is not possible to conclude on the basis of the information produced for this purpose that sufficiently general and consistent experience exists for the view to be taken that the harmfulness of an agreement such as that at issue in the main proceedings to competition justifies dispensing with any examination of the specific effects of that agreement on competition. The information relied on by the Competition Authority, the Hungarian Government and the Commission in that connection, that is to say, primarily, that authority’s decision-making practice and the case law of the Courts of the European Union, specifically demonstrates, as things currently stand, the need to conduct an in-depth examination of the effects of such an agreement in order to ascertain whether it actually had the effect of introducing a minimum threshold applicable to the service charges and whether, having regard to the situation which would have prevailed if that agreement had not existed, the agreement was restrictive of competition by virtue of its effects.”</p>

Fourthly, it must not afford them the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.

He went on to address the relationship of that standard of proof with the requirement under EU law (citing the Mastercard Commission Decision at para 690) that the claim that a restrictive agreement creates efficiencies must be founded on detailed, robust and compelling analysis and that assumptions and deductions be based on empirical data and facts.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my judgment the distinction being drawn is between: (a) real links to real efficiencies, capable of being observed and demonstrated on the facts by evidence (in other words, requiring empirical data); and (b) theoretical or logically assumed links and efficiencies based on broad economic or logical analysis, opinion or anecdotal evidence, perhaps sound in theory but possibly failing to take into account one or more of the many factors which arise in highly complex interactions in the real economy. I see no difficulty in this court determining whether the former has been proved on the balance of probabilities. That test is capable of accommodating varying requirements as to what is expected to meet the standard: contract terms must be ‘certain’, allegations of fraud must be ‘distinctly proved’ and it is often said that ‘cogent’ evidence is required to rebut certain presumptions. In the case of article 101(3), it is recognised that robust analysis and cogent evidence will be required to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that a restrictive agreement in fact and in the real world (as opposed to in theory) gives rise to pro-competitive effects.” (at para 24)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Phillips J went on to state (at para 25) that in his view this analysis did not differ significantly from that of Popplewell J.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“77.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Pursuant to article 2 of the Modernisation Regulation [Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 on the implementation of Treaty competition rules (OJ 2003 L1, p 1)] the burden of proving that these cumulative conditions are satisfied is upon the schemes. Recital 5 to the [Modernisation] Regulation makes it clear, however, that the standard of proof is for the national law, so that the usual civil standard of the balance of probabilities applies.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">It then adopted para 24 of the Visa exemption judgment of Phillips J and continued:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“80.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>We agree with Phillips J (at para 25 of that judgment), that this analysis does not differ significantly from that of Popplewell J at para 305 of his judgment, but to the extent that there are any differences, we prefer the analysis of Phillips J. In so far as Ms Dinah Rose QC, leading counsel for Visa, sought to argue that Phillips J adopted too prescriptive an approach and that any evidence should suffice provided it meets the civil standard of proof, we do not accept that argument. We consider that Phillips J was right that regard should be had to the requirement of the Commission and the CJEU for cogent and convincing arguments and evidence (see <i>GlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited v Commission of the European Communities </i>(Case T-168/01) EU:T:2006:265, [2006] ECR II-2969; [2006] 5 CMLR 1623 … para 235, which was applied and followed in the General Court’s decision in <i>MasterCard</i> at para 196).</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">81.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Although the standard of proof is a matter of English law, the nature of the evidence which will satisfy that standard must be informed by European Union law and Commission decisional practice since, ultimately, whether a party is entitled to exemption involves the application of a European treaty. Furthermore, in that context, it is important to maintain a consistency of approach across member states as to the requirements of article 101(3).”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Other passages in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (paras 85, 86 and 249) demonstrate that it considered that EU law requires cogent factual and empirical evidence to satisfy article 101(3). In particular, the Court of Appeal (at paras 84 and 85) derived from the Commission Guidelines on the application of what is now article 101(3) TFEU (2004/C 101/8) (“the Guidelines”) and the EU jurisprudence on article 101(3), first, a need for the relevant benefits to be causally linked to the relevant restriction and, secondly, for that causal link to be established “by facts and evidence supported by empirical analysis and data and not just economic theory”. It added (at para 86):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Thirdly, as para 54 of the Guidelines makes clear, the causal link must be sufficiently direct to be capable of proof and an indirect effect will not generally be sufficient, precisely because cogent evidence of the link based on empirical analysis and data and not merely economic theory is required.”</p>

The Court of Appeal made clear that its objection was to reliance solely on economic theory and that, in its view, a claim under article 101(3) must be based on empirical data and fact and not economic theory alone (paras 85 and 86).</a></p><a name="para110">

They take as their starting point Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 on the implementation of Treaty competition rules (“the Modernisation Regulation”). The major change effected by the Modernisation Regulation was that whereas previously the grant of exemption from the prohibition on agreements which restrict competition had been the exclusive function of the European Commission, the Modernisation Regulation introduced a directly applicable exception system in which the competition authorities and courts of the member states have the power to apply the exemption provisions under what is now article 101(3). The previous system of notification to the Commission for exemptions was abolished and the widespread involvement of national courts and authorities in exempting restrictive agreements was clearly contemplated. It is in this context that recital 5 of the Preamble states:</a></p><a name="para111"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In order to ensure an effective enforcement of the Community competition rules and at the same time the respect of fundamental rights of defence, this Regulation should regulate the burden of proof under articles 81 and 82 [now articles 101 and 102] of the Treaty. It should be for the party or the authority alleging an infringement of article 81(1) and article 82 of the Treaty to prove the existence thereof to the required legal standard. It should be for the undertaking or association of undertakings invoking the benefit of a defence against a finding of an infringement to demonstrate to the required legal standard that the conditions for applying such defence are satisfied. This Regulation affects neither national rules on the standard of proof nor obligations of competition authorities and courts of the member states to ascertain the relevant facts of a case, provided that such rules and obligations are compatible with general principles of Community law.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Similarly, article 2 which bears the heading “Burden of proof” provides:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In any national or Community proceedings for the application of articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, the burden of proving an infringement of article 81(1) or of article 82 of the Treaty shall rest on the party or the authority alleging the infringement. The undertaking or association of undertakings claiming the benefit of article 81(3) of the Treaty shall bear the burden of proving that the conditions of that paragraph are fulfilled.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">There is, accordingly, a clear allocation of the burden of proof, while questions as to the standard of proof are left to the law of the member state concerned, provided that the national rules are compatible with general principles of EU law. Visa and Mastercard submit, therefore, that EU law expressly reserves the question of the standard of proof to national law, subject to the principles of effectiveness and equivalence.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although article 2 of Regulation No 1/2003 expressly governs the allocation of the burden of proof, that regulation does not contain any provisions on more specific procedural aspects. Thus, in particular, that regulation does not contain any provision in relation to the principles governing the assessment of evidence and the standard of proof in national proceedings for the application of article 101 TFEU.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That conclusion is confirmed by recital 5 of Regulation No 1/2003, which expressly states that the regulation does not affect national rules on the standard of proof.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to settled case law, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each member state to establish them in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, provided, however, that those rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) …”</p>

The issue in that case, which was a reference from the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania in proceedings where an anti-competitive concerted practice was alleged, was whether certain evidence was sufficient proof of a fact which, if established, would trigger a presumption of liability under article 101(1). The passage in the judgment of the Court of Justice at paras 30-32, cited above, was concerned with the specific question whether the dispatch of a message through an electronic system may constitute sufficient evidence to establish that the operators which used the system were aware, or ought to have been aware, of the content of that message. Unsurprisingly, the Court of Justice held that, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, the standard of proof in relation to establishing that fact was a matter for the national legal order of the member state concerned. The Court of Justice went on, however, (at para 33) to distinguish the presumption arising under article 101(1) of a causal connection between a concertation and the market conduct of the undertakings participating in the practice. That presumption, it emphasised, followed from article 101(1) and consequently formed an integral part of the EU law which the national court was required to apply. The Court of Justice then went on (at paras 46-49) to address in detail the nature of the evidence that would be sufficient to rebut the presumption.</a></p><a name="para113"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para113"></a><a name="para114">114.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the fact that the Court of Justice in <i>Eturas</i> addressed, as a question of EU law, what evidence was capable of rebutting the presumption of participation in a concerted practice provides the key to resolving the present issue. In that case Advocate General Szpunar observed (at AG100), with regard to rebuttable presumptions in competition law:</a></p><a name="para114"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Insofar as such presumptions stem from article 101(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the court, and consequently form an integral part of applicable EU law, they do not fall within the scope of the principle of the autonomy of national procedural law and are therefore binding on national authorities when they apply EU competition rules.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">As Mr Nicholas Khan QC, on behalf of the Commission, put it in his oral submissions, <i>Eturas </i>illustrates how the nature of the evidence by which a finding of infringement can be secured or rebutted may be a question of EU law. In the same way, the nature of the evidence by which an undertaking may establish that a restriction on competition is exempted by virtue of article 101(3) may also be a question of EU law.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para114"></a><a name="para115">115.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the essential complaint made by Visa and Mastercard under this ground of appeal does not relate to the standard of proof but to the nature of the evidence required to meet the standard of proof in this context. More specifically, it relates to the type of evidence needed to establish that the benefits from the MIF rules under consideration outweigh the detriments to merchants and are indispensable for achieving those benefits. The Court of Appeal recognised this distinction at paras 77 to 81 of its judgment, where it expressly accepted that the applicable standard of proof was the usual civil standard of the balance of probabilities but observed that the nature of the evidence which will satisfy that standard must be informed by EU law and Commission decisional practice. While the Modernisation Regulation recognises the autonomy of member states in determining the legal test for the standard of proof under article 101(3), it does not recognise any autonomy in the member states to determine the nature of the evidence required to satisfy that standard. The outcome on this issue, therefore, does not depend on Visa and Mastercard upholding national procedural rules about the standard of proof but on whether EU law imposes requirements as to what type of evidence is capable of discharging that burden.</a></p><a name="para115">

Section 60 of the 1998 Act imports these requirements into domestic competition law. Article 101(3) is founded on the notion that notwithstanding the existence of a restriction on competition and its likely negative effect on competition and consumers, efficiencies and benefits arising from the conduct which gave rise to the restriction may, nevertheless, justify exemption from the prohibition in article 101(1). This is an inherently empirical proposition and necessarily requires the authority or court addressing the issue to carry out a balancing exercise - a “complex assessment” (<i>GlaxoSmithKline</i>, Court of First Instance, at paras 241, 304 and 307) - involving weighing the pro-competitive effect against the anti-competitive effect of the conduct in question. Cogent empirical evidence is necessary in order to carry out the required evaluation of the claimed efficiencies and benefits. To the extent that objective efficiencies caused by a restriction cannot be established empirically, they cannot be balanced with the restrictive effects. As a result, although the standard of proof is a matter of domestic law, the nature of the evidence which will satisfy that standard must take account of the substantive requirements of article 101(3).</a></p><a name="para116">

The Guidelines are not binding but they are based on the experience and expertise of the Commission which had previously had sole responsibility for carrying out the balancing test and granting exemptions, and they provide an analytical framework for the application of article 101(3). In particular, they address (at paras 50 and 51) what is involved in identifying and evaluating the causal link between a restriction of competition and the creation of an efficiency and they cast light on this balancing exercise.</a></p><a name="para118"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the first condition of [article 101(3)] is to define the types of efficiency gains that can be taken into account and be subject to the further tests of the second and third conditions of [article 101(3)]. The aim of the analysis is to ascertain what are the objective benefits created by the agreement and what is the economic importance of such efficiencies. Given that for [article 101(3)] to apply the pro-competitive effects flowing from the agreement must outweigh its anti-competitive effects, it is necessary to verify what is the link between the agreement and the claimed efficiencies and what is the value of these efficiencies.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Commission did not dispute that payment card schemes such as Mastercard’s may represent, as such, economic and technical progress. However, it considered that the decisive question was whether the Mastercard MIF specifically contributed to that progress (at recital 679). In addressing Mastercard’s “balancing of demand” arguments the Commission referred to the assumption underlying the Mastercard MIF that there was a perceived imbalance between the issuing and the acquiring business in the scheme. The Commission observed (at recital 686):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Also, an ‘imbalance’ between issuing and acquiring cannot be assumed on the basis of <i>cost</i> considerations only but has to comprise an analysis of <i>revenues</i> as well. A cost imbalance is as such no sufficient evidence to explain why MasterCard’s MIF is always paid by the acquirer to the issuer, irrespective of the concrete market situation. If receipts (interests, money exchange fees, penalty fees, etc) or other monetary benefits (resulting from cost savings such as reduction of staff, paperwork etc) from payment card issuing provide sufficient commercial incentives for banks to invest in incremental card issuing, a transfer from acquiring to issuing may be superfluous and even counterproductive as the revenue transfer dampens card acceptance due to the increase of costs on the merchants’ side. Robust empirical evidence is therefore required to establish the necessity for and the direction of a fallback interchange fee.” (Original emphasis) (See also recital 720)</p>

It continued (at recital 695):</a></p><a name="para122"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is on the undertakings in the first place to present to the Commission the evidence intended to establish that the agreement in question fulfils the conditions laid down by [article 101(3)] of the Treaty. In the context of the first condition it has to be ascertained that the restrictive effects are offset by efficiencies. In this context the undertakings concerned must demonstrate whether a MIF generates the positive effects which the underlying model claims to achieve, here: an increase of system output and possible related efficiencies. To the extent that objective efficiencies cannot be established empirically, they cannot be balanced with the restrictive effects. Some form of convincing empirical evidence on the actual effect of a MIF on the market is therefore required.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">A footnote to the third sentence of recital 695 (footnote 840) reads:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Again, it should be noted that an increase in system output does not constitute an objective efficiency if the benefits of increased card usage only accrue to banks, while customers and merchants are worse off due to higher retail prices and increased merchant fees.

However, the Commission’s statements at recitals 686 and 695 are general statements made before consideration of the Baxter framework which is introduced at recital 703.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Contrary to MasterCard’s perception the Commission’s position is not that only the level of a MIF is a decisive criterion for assessing whether that MIF fulfils the first condition of [article 101(3)] of the Treaty. Rather, the existence of objective appreciable efficiencies is assessed in relation to the MIF as such, the effects it produces on the market and the manner in which it is set. In particular, the Commission verifies on the basis of the evidence submitted whether the model underlying a MIF is based on realistic assumptions (which is not the case here), whether the methodology used to implement that model in practice is objective and reasonable (which is not the case for the two methodologies used by MasterCard) and whether the MIF indeed has the positive effect on the market to the benefit of both customer groups which the model claims.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Commission was not subscribing here to the view that convincing proof of efficiencies can be provided by economic modelling and assumptions alone. On the contrary, the Commission made abundantly clear the need for empirical evidence in the immediately preceding recital:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is no presumption that MIFs in general enhance the efficiency of card schemes just as there is no presumption that they do not fulfil the conditions of [article 101(3)] of the Treaty and are therefore illegal. A MIF may be used by banks to achieve efficiencies as well as to extract rents. The Commission’s conclusion on the efficiencies of a MIF will depend on the concrete evidence brought forward by the parties.” (recital 730)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">and the immediately following recital:</p>

In those proceedings, Mastercard had complained that “an excessively high burden of proof” had been imposed on the applicants in relation to the conditions of what is now article 101(3) TFEU, whereas the Commission had been “required to analyse the arguments and the evidence adduced by reference to the balance of probabilities alone” (paras 194, 195 and 237). In rejecting this submission, the General Court observed (at para 196) that “a person who relies on [article 101(3)] must demonstrate that those conditions are satisfied, by means of convincing arguments and evidence”. At a later point in the judgment the General Court observed:</a></p><a name="para125"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“232.&nbsp; So far as concerns the allegation relating to the lack of data capable of meeting the standard of economic proof demanded by the Commission, even if that were established, it does not mean that the burden of proof is eased, or even reversed, as the applicants seem to suggest. It must be observed that such a difficulty might be regarded as having resulted from the arguments developed by the applicants during the administrative procedure.</p>

It was also for them to establish that there was a sufficiently clear correlation between the costs involved in the provision of those services and the level of the MIF. As regards the last point, it must be noted that those costs cannot be determined without taking into account other revenues obtained by issuing banks on the provision of those services or by including costs which are not directly linked to them.”</p>

In their submission, the EU has, by legislation, expressly deferred procedural autonomy to member states, not just in respect of the legal test for the standard of proof, but also in relation to the nature of evidence required to satisfy that domestic standard, subject only to the EU principles of equivalence and effectiveness. In our view, this submission is contradicted by authority and is simply wrong. While EU law has deferred to the law of member states in respect of the standard of proof under article 101(3), subject to the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, it clearly maintains its own requirements as to the type of evidence which may be capable of discharging the appropriate standard of proof. Moreover, those requirements cannot vary depending on whether EU competition law is being applied by EU courts or authorities or the courts or authorities of member states. As the Court of Appeal observed in the present case (at para 81), it is important to maintain a consistency of approach across member states as to the requirements of article 101(3). It should be noted, in this regard, that the Modernisation Regulation emphasises the importance of the effective and uniform application of competition law within the EU. (See recitals 1, <span style="font-size:12.0pt">14, 17, 19, 21</span> and 22 and article 16.) In the same way, national courts are required by section 60(2) of the 1998 Act to ensure consistency in the application of article 101 with that of the General Court and the Court of Justice. In our view, EU law clearly requires an undertaking seeking exemption under article 101(3) to produce cogent empirical evidence in support of that claim.</a></p><a name="para128">

In the present case, Visa submits, a judge would be entitled to conclude that nothing more is required than the expert evidence of economists to prove that an issuing bank which receives a payment on each card transaction undertaken by its customers will probably invest more to encourage its customers to engage in a greater number of such card transactions than it would do if it did not receive any such payments. This submission, however, grossly underestimates the complexity and subtlety of the balancing exercise required under article 101(3). In particular, as the AAM parties point out, an assessment of any benefits accruing to consumers and merchants from MIFs will depend on a range of factors including “issuer pass-through” (the extent to which issuing banks decide to recycle MIF revenues into promotional behaviour) and “always card transactions” (the extent to which cardholders alter their behaviour in the light of any incentives provided). Thus, in the present case the Court of Appeal correctly concluded (at para 88) that establishing the requisite causal link involves two critical stages: first that the default MIFs in each case incentivise the issuers to take steps they would not otherwise have taken, and secondly that the steps taken did indeed increase card usage or increase the efficiencies of transactions which would have been card transactions anyway. (See also the judgment of Popplewell J at para 310 and the Visa exemption judgment of Phillips J at para 37.) Such factors must necessarily be taken into account in assessing whether appreciable objective advantages for consumers arise from the restriction in question so as to compensate for its competitive disadvantages. This process necessarily requires empirical evidence.</a></p><a name="para129">

As a result, it is submitted, the prohibition applies before empirical, real world evidence of the type demanded by the Court of Appeal can be available. Undertakings, it is said, must be able to make a realistic assessment, at the time of making their agreement, as to whether article 101(3) is satisfied or not and that can only be done with the best evidence that is reasonably available at the time. In our view, there is nothing in the Court of Appeal’s approach which is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the legislation. Indeed, the answers advanced by the AAM parties are, in our view, compelling. First, the Guidelines state (at para 58) that, in cases where an agreement has yet to be fully implemented, “the parties must substantiate any projections as to the date from which the efficiencies will become operational so as to have a significant positive impact in the market”. (See also the General Court in <i>GlaxoSmithKline</i> at para 249.) Secondly, it is not the case that where, as in the present case, there is experience of restrictive measures over many years, the courts must disregard the evidence then available to them in assessing the issue of exemption. Thus, in <i>Krka Tovarna Zdravil d d v European Commission </i>(Case T-684/14) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2018/T68414.html">[2019] 4 CMLR 14</a><i>, </i>the General Court (Ninth Chamber) observed (at para 360), with regard to the assessment of distortion of competition under article 101(1) by comparison with the situation which would have existed but for the agreement:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It appears paradoxical - where the clauses of an agreement have been implemented and their impact on competition can be measured by taking into account the relevant factual developments, including those subsequent to the conclusion of the agreement, which took place before the Commission issued its decision - to allow the Commission to demonstrate merely the anticompetitive effects that such clauses are likely to have and, to that end, to make the comparison … without taking those developments into account.”</p>

The MIT, which is also known as “the tourist test”, is an economic methodology developed by Professors Rochet and Tirole, initially in a paper published in 2008. It embodies the notion that there is a level of MIF which, when included in the MSCs paid by merchants, equalises the cost to merchants of accepting a scheme card with the cost of their accepting other methods of payment such as cash. If the MIT is set at that level, a merchant would be indifferent as to whether a one-off customer (such as a tourist) chooses to pay with cash or card, so long as he does not choose to shop elsewhere. If, however, it is set at a higher level, while a merchant could in principle be better off by refusing to accept scheme cards because other forms of payment would be cheaper, in reality, if he did so, he would probably lose sales to rivals who did accept them (“the business-stealing effect”). There are “must-take cards” that merchants cannot turn down. The MIT seeks to put an upper limit on MIFs so that the schemes are not able to exploit their market power over merchants in this way<i> </i>(Rochet and Tirole, Must-Take Cards: Merchant Discounts and Avoided Costs, (2011) Journal of the European Economic Association 9(3): 462 at 463). Visa and Mastercard rely on the MIT in two ways.</a></p><a name="para132">

This is not correct. While the Commission and the European Parliament accepted the MIT for the purpose of setting a cap under the Regulation, the Commission has consistently maintained that adoption of the MIT alone will not lead to automatic exemption. This is reflected in recital 10 of the IFR:</a></p><a name="para133"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In addition to a consistent application of the competition rules to interchange fees, regulating such fees would improve the functioning of the internal market and contribute to reducing transaction costs for consumers.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">and in recital 14:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The application of this Regulation should be without prejudice to the application of Union and national competition rules. It should not prevent member states from maintaining or introducing lower caps or measures of equivalent object or effect through national legislation.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In enacting the IFR, the Commission and the European Parliament were concerned with regulation and were not specifically addressing issues of EU competition law.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para133"></a><a name="para134">134.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, Visa and Mastercard submit that the Commission has repeatedly taken into account a variety of forms of available evidence, including economic theory and in particular the MIT, when examining MIFs. In this regard, they rely in particular on a number of commitment decisions made under article 9 of the Modernisation Regulation. It is undoubtedly correct that the Commission has in these decisions had regard to the MIT as a proxy or a benchmark. However, it is important to bear in mind that these decisions are not instances of the application of article 101(3) but pragmatic means employed by the Commission to compromise outstanding investigations in return for commitments. As Mr Khan explained on behalf of the Commission, whereas an infringement decision adopted pursuant to article 7 of the Modernisation Regulation would have to include an assessment of any claim by the addressee that the agreement in issue qualified for an article 101(3) exemption, a commitment decision pursuant to article 9 does not include such an assessment. The essence of a commitment decision is that the Commission does not take a position on the existence of an infringement of article 101(1) TFEU, the approach being based on procedural economy. Moreover, the Commission has made clear that a MIF which satisfies the MIT will not automatically be considered compliant with what is now article 101(3). Thus, in its Memorandum of 1 April 2009 (Memo/09/143), at the time of accepting undertakings from Mastercard, it accepted that the MIT provides “a reasonable benchmark for assessing a MIF level that generates benefits to merchants and final consumers”. However, it went on to point out that the general applicability of the test for the purposes of what is now article 101(3) “depends on the specifics of the markets at hand”. Having listed some “cautionary examples”, it emphasised that where a MIF is restrictive, the parties to the agreement must demonstrate that the conditions under article 101(3) are met. It continued:</a></p><a name="para134"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this respect, there is a need to ascertain that the concrete model underlying a MIF is based on realistic assumptions, that the model is plausibly implemented through an objectively verifiable methodology and that the MIF indeed yields the objective efficiencies on the market which are claimed by the parties. The methodology underlying a MIF should be transparent to the final users of a scheme. However, if a card scheme wishes to pre-determine the fees merchants pay through a MIF, it must be aware that the burden of proof to demonstrate the fulfilment of the four conditions under [article 101(3)] lies upon the scheme and its members.” (at pp 6-7)</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134"></a><a name="para135">135.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a further and more fundamental reason why the MIT does not assist Visa and Mastercard on the present issue. It is not designed as a substitute for the balancing test as a means of establishing efficiencies and benefits under article 101(3). It is, rather, designed to meet the specific concern that merchants may be vulnerable because they are typically in a poor position to resist consumers who want them to accept cards in exchange for goods or services. As a result, the MIT seeks to ensure that the collective interchange fees do not rise above a level at which payment by card is more expensive for merchants than other methods of payment.</a></p><a name="para135"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para135"></a><a name="para136">136.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a situation where a MIF satisfies the MIT and where the issuing bank recycles all of its MIF income to cardholders, there should be no net detriment to cardholders and merchants considered together. If, on the other hand, as in the present case, the issuer pass-through is less than 100% (ie the issuer retains a part of the MIF), there is likely to be a net loss to cardholders and merchants considered together. A net benefit could still arise in these circumstances, however, if the MIF revenue passed to cardholders caused them to make greater use of their cards, so that merchants were relieved of a sufficiently large number of transactions using a more expensive form of payment, with the result that the loss to cardholders and merchants considered together from reduced issuer pass-through was outweighed. Whether this in fact occurs will depend on the extent of issuer pass-through, the extent of always card transactions and the difference in cost for merchants between accepting a scheme card and an alternative form of payment. As Mr Jon Turner QC put it on behalf of the AAM parties, the theory of the MIT does not even purport to avoid the need to address such issues, which would be essential if an appropriate balancing exercise under article 101(3) were to be carried out. These are highly relevant matters that can be brought into account only on the basis of empirical evidence.</a></p><a name="para136">

We agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal (at para 109), accepting the submissions of the Commission, that the Commission regards the MIT as a useful starting point but not as a substitute for the facts of the case. It is not a silver bullet for Visa and Mastercard. In order to obtain exemption, they still have to back up any reliance on the MIT as a benchmark with robust analysis and cogent empirical evidence.</a></p><a name="para137">

It concerns the interpretation of article 101(3) TFEU, under which an agreement, decision or concerted practice which is restrictive of competition is exempted from the prohibition imposed by article 101(1) provided it satisfies certain conditions. The terms of article 101(3) have been set out at para 19 above. As described at para 107 above, four conditions must be met before an exemption can be granted. It is the second of those conditions which is here in issue, namely that consumers must receive a fair share of the benefits resulting from the restriction of competition.</a></p><a name="para139">

On one side of the market, issuers compete with each other for the business of customers to whom they will issue cards (the issuing market). The cardholders are the consumers in the issuing market. On the other side of the market, acquirers compete with each other for the business of merchants to whom they seek to offer acquiring services (the acquiring market). Merchants are the consumers in the acquiring market. As has been explained, MIFs restrict competition in the acquiring market. They do not restrict competition in the issuing market.</a></p><a name="para140">

He concluded that they would not. That was because, in his opinion, they did not meet the first condition for exemption under article 101(3): it had not been proved that they produced any benefits. He nonetheless went on to consider the second condition at paras 53-64 of the Visa exemption judgment. He accepted Visa’s argument, based on its analysis of the judgment in <i>Mastercard CJ</i>, particularly at paras 240-243 and 247, that for the purpose of deciding whether “consumers” received a fair share of the resulting benefits, it was necessary in the context of a two-sided market to consider the position of consumers in both markets as a whole. Benefits accruing to cardholders as a result of MIFs could therefore be taken into account in determining whether the benefits at least equalled the disadvantages. He considered that there must, however, be at least some objective advantages for merchants, even if they were less than the burden they suffered. On that interpretation, the second condition could be satisfied even if merchants were worse off as a result of MIFs, provided they received some objective advantages, and the benefits to cardholders and merchants, considered in aggregate, outweighed the disadvantages. However, given his finding that no benefits were generated by MIFs, it followed that that requirement was not met.</a></p><a name="para141">

Like Phillips J, he considered that the MIFs were not prohibited by article 101(1), but went on to consider whether, if that was incorrect, they would qualify for exemption under article 101(3). He concluded that they would, applying what we have held to be an incorrect approach to the standard of proof. In relation to the first condition, he accepted at para 278 that, in a two-sided market such as the Mastercard scheme, the relevant consumers included cardholders as well as merchants, and that the relevant benefits were not, therefore, confined to those arising on the acquiring market. When it came to the second condition, however, since merchants were the consumers who were adversely affected by the restriction of competition caused by MIFs, he concluded at paras 280-287 that the “fair share” requirement would not be met unless, as a minimum, they obtained benefits from MIFs which matched the anti-competitive disadvantages which MIFs imposed on them. In addition, he considered that the MIFs must not generate unduly high profits for issuers: para 287. On the facts, he concluded at para 409 that those requirements were met, again applying a standard of proof which we have held to be mistaken.</a></p><a name="para142">

Popplewell J’s analysis was not challenged. The court carefully considered the relevant sections of <i>Mastercard GC</i> and <i>Mastercard CJ</i> at paras 96-104 of its judgment. It interpreted paras 240-243 and 247 of <i>Mastercard CJ</i>, in particular, as meaning that in applying both the first and the second conditions in a situation where the restriction affects two markets, if the restriction causes disadvantages overall to the consumers in the market under consideration (here the merchants in the acquiring market), those disadvantages cannot be compensated by advantages to consumers in the other market (here the cardholders in the issuing market), unless the two groups of consumers are substantially the same; which is not the position in this case. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the consumers in the relevant market, here the merchants, would only receive a fair share of the benefits if the advantages to them caused by the restriction outweighed the disadvantages, so that they were no worse off.

<p class="ParaHeading">The Mastercard Commission Decision</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para145"></a><a name="para146">146.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is best to begin by considering the Mastercard Commission Decision, which was the subject-matter of the judgments of the General Court and the Court of Justice in <i>Mastercard GC</i> and <i>Mastercard CJ</i> respectively. The Commission concluded at recital 733 that the Mastercard MIFs did not meet the first condition of article 81(3) of the EC Treaty (now article 101(3) TFEU). When it went on to consider the second condition, it stated at recitals 740 to 742:</a></p><a name="para146"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“740.&nbsp; There is no reason to assume from the outset that an interchange fee paid by acquirers to issuers increases the utility of the payment card system to [both]<i> </i>groups of consumers alike. The Commission does not dispute that <i>merchants may benefit through enhanced network effects from the issuing side, but this does not necessarily offset their losses</i> which result from paying inflated merchant fees. In setting a MIF the member banks of a card scheme must guarantee a fair share of the benefits to [all]<i> </i>customers, not only to those that are on the side of the scheme which receives the MIF. In a scheme where the MIF is paid by the acquirer to the issuer, <i>the efficiencies must in particular counterbalance the restrictive effects to the detriment of merchants</i> (and subsequent purchasers). MasterCard has not submitted evidence in this respect.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">741.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission has therefore reviewed the methodologies which MasterCard uses as ‘starting point’ for setting the level of the Intra-EEA fallback interchange fees. It … can be left open in this case whether cardholders sufficiently benefit from MasterCard’s MIF. The Commission’s concerns under the second condition of article 81(3) of the Treaty in this decision relate to the customer group which bears the cost of the MIF, that is the merchants.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">742.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>While merchants may benefit through enhanced network effects from the issuing side, this does not necessarily offset their losses</i> which result from paying inflated merchant fees.” (Emphasis added)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Commission concluded at recital 743 that “without further evidence - which Mastercard failed to submit - it cannot safely be assumed that … Mastercard is creating objective efficiencies that benefit <i>all </i>customers, including those that bear the cost of its MIF (merchants and subsequent purchasers)” (emphasis in original).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… [T]he condition that consumers (<sup>55</sup>) must receive a fair share of the benefits implies in general that efficiencies generated by the restrictive agreement within a relevant market must be sufficient to outweigh the anti-competitive effects produced by the agreement within that same relevant market (<sup>56</sup>). Negative effects on consumers in one geographic market or product market cannot normally be balanced against and compensated by positive effects for consumers in another unrelated geographic market or product market. However, where two markets are related, efficiencies achieved on separate markets can be taken into account provided that the group of consumers affected by the restriction and benefiting from the efficiency gains are substantially the same (<sup>57</sup>).” (Emphasis added)</p>

In addition, on the facts of the case, the consumers in both markets were substantially the same.

However, as merchants constitute one of the two groups of users affected by payment cards, the very existence of the second condition of article 81(3) EC necessarily means that the existence of appreciable objective advantages attributable to the MIF must also be established in regard to them.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">229.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in the absence of such proof, the applicants’ criticism that insufficient account was taken of the advantages of the MIF for cardholders is, in all events, ineffective.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“AG154.&nbsp; The point of law underlying that complaint is therefore whether, in order for the exemption provided for in article 81(3) EC to be applicable in such a context, it is necessary that the fair share of the profit resulting from the advantages arising from the agreement, as provided for in article 81(3) EC, be reserved for the direct consumers of the services provided on the market on which the restrictive effects for competition are produced - in this case, in particular, merchants - or whether it can be considered that the restrictive effects harming those consumers may be compensated by the advantages produced for consumers of the services provided on a related market, namely, in this case, cardholders.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“AG155. &nbsp;It should be borne in mind, as a preliminary point, that the second condition in article 81(3) EC requires that, in order for a restrictive agreement to benefit from the exemption provided for in that provision, consumers must be allowed a fair share of the resulting benefits.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">AG156. &nbsp;In that regard, it should be observed, first, that <i>the consumers referred to in that provision must be considered to be the direct or indirect consumers of the goods or services covered by the agreement</i>. Secondly, it is apparent from consistent case law that, in order for an agreement restrictive of competition to be capable of being exempted under article 81(3) EC, the appreciable objective advantages created by that agreement must be of such a character as to compensate for the disadvantages which they cause for competition. It may be inferred from that case law that, <i>in order for a restrictive agreement to be able to benefit from the exemption, the advantages resulting from that agreement must ensure that consumers are compensated in full for the actual or probable adverse effects that they must bear owing to the restriction of competition resulting from the agreement</i>. In other words, the benefits arising from the restrictive agreement must counterbalance its negative effects.” (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“AG157. &nbsp;To my mind, however, that compensation must apply to consumers who are directly or indirectly affected by the agreement. It is the consumers that suffer the harm caused by the restrictive effects of the agreement at issue that must, in principle, be allowed, as compensation for that harm, the fair share of the benefit resulting from the agreement referred to in article 81(3) EC.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“AG158.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if it were possible to take into consideration the advantages resulting from an agreement for <i>one </i>category of consumers of certain services in order to counterbalance the negative effects on <i>another </i>category of consumers of other services on a different market, that would amount to allowing the former category of consumers to be favoured to the detriment of the latter category. However, distributive logic of that type seem[s] to me, in principle, to have no connection with the practical scope of competition law. Competition law is intended to protect the structure of the market, and thus competition, in the interest of competitors and, ultimately, consumers in general. Conversely, it is not intended to favour one category of consumers to the detriment of a different category.” (Emphasis in original)</p>

It added at para 237 that, in the case of a two-sided system such as the Mastercard scheme, in order to assess whether the first condition was met, it was necessary to take into account, where appropriate, all the objective advantages flowing from the restrictive measure in both markets, and to assess whether the advantages were of such a character as to compensate for the disadvantages which the measure entailed for competition.</a></p><a name="para163">

They are, however, essentially different. The second condition adds a distinct requirement of “fairness” to the considerations of economic efficiency with which the first condition is primarily concerned. Consideration of aggregate efficiency gains across different markets may well be relevant to the first condition, in situations where restrictive measures have effects in more than one market, but they cannot ordinarily be determinative of the question, under the second condition, whether a “fair share” of those gains has accrued to the consumers affected by the restriction of competition.</a></p><a name="para170">

We therefore dismiss the appeal on issue (iii). Having reached that clear conclusion, it is unnecessary, and would be inappropriate, for this court to make a reference to the CJEU merely for the purpose of obtaining its clarification of the effect of the second condition in article 101(3) TFEU. It may, however, be helpful if, in addition to rejecting Visa’s argument, we provide some positive guidance, based upon our own understanding of the EU materials, while recognising that it lacks the authority accorded by EU law to a judgment of the CJEU.</a></p><a name="para171">

In order to meet the requirements of the first condition, in a situation where there is a two-sided market and the restrictive effects of the measure in question are experienced by consumers in only one of those markets, and where the consumers in both markets are not substantially the same, it has to be proved (1) that the measure causes appreciable objective advantages for consumers in the market where the restrictive effects are felt, and (2) that the objective advantages caused by the measure for consumers in both markets, taken together, compensate for the disadvantages which the measure entails for competition: see paras 240-242 of <i>Mastercard CJ</i>.</a></p><a name="para172">

The Advocate General’s reasoning in point 156 of his Opinion can be summarised in the following propositions:</a></p><a name="para173"> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “consumers” referred to in the second condition are the direct or indirect consumers of the goods or services covered by the measure: here, the merchants.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those consumers must be compensated in full for the adverse effects that they bear owing to the restriction of competition resulting from the measure.</p>

It also reflects the language of the second condition. The merchants are the consumers of the services which are subject to the restriction of competition, and are therefore the consumers which the second condition is presumably intended to protect. If the merchants are not fully compensated for the harm inflicted on them by the restrictive measure, it is difficult to see how they can be said to receive a “fair” share of the resultant benefits. As the Advocate General indicated at point 158 of his Opinion, it is not the purpose of competition law to permit anti-competitive practices to harm consumers in one market for the sake of providing benefits to those in another.</a></p><a name="para174">

The court continued:</a></p><a name="para176"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The broad axe principle is applicable where the claimant has suffered loss as a result of the defendant’s culpable conduct but there is a lack of evidence as to the amount of such loss. There is no scope for the application of any such principle where the burden lies on the defendant to establish a pass-on of the unlawful overcharge in order to reduce the amount recoverable by the claimant.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The broad axe issue which is said to arise out of this statement is: “Did the Court of Appeal find, and if so, did it err in law in finding, that a defendant has to prove the exact amount of loss mitigated in order to reduce damages?”.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para176"></a><a name="para177">177.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal’s statement is part of its discussion of a ground of appeal based on the assertion that the CAT had been inconsistent in rejecting Mastercard’s case that the merchants had mitigated their loss by pass-on while making an allowance, when awarding compound interest, for pass-on, which it estimated at 50% of the claimed loss (paras 320-342). Mastercard has not renewed that submission in these appeals, but, as we explain below, the debate around this issue widened in the course of the hearing.</a></p><a name="para177">

In the following paragraph (para 332) the court stated:</a></p><a name="para178"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“On the other hand, we accept Mr Hoskins’s submission that in each case it is a matter for the judge to decide whether, on the evidence before her or him, the defendant can show that there is a sufficiently close causal connection between an overcharge and an increase in the direct purchaser’s price. We see no reason why that increase should not be established by a combination of empirical fact and economic opinion evidence. It is not appropriate for us on these appeals to be more specific as to the nature and type of evidence capable of satisfying a trial judge that there is a sufficiently close causal connection.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is therefore clear that the Court of Appeal was not excluding any form of evidence as relevant to the establishment of pass-on, but was drawing a distinction between the degree of precision in quantification required of the defendant pleading pass-on in mitigation of loss and that which was required of the victim of the wrong in establishing its claim. The questions which arise are whether there is a requirement in European law or otherwise a basis in principle for that distinction.</p>

The court, having regard to all of the evidence, could and should estimate the extent of the pass-on in order to give adequate compensation to the claimant and avoid over-compensation. Mastercard accepts that at the trial before the CAT of Sainsbury’s claim against it, which covered quantification as well as liability (see para 28 above), it had not succeeded in proving that the overcharge had caused Sainsbury’s to raise the prices which it charged its customers. The matter is closed in that dispute but it remains a live issue in relation to other claims.</a></p><a name="para179">

In those cases, the CJEU recognised the right of the defendant to meet the claim for restitution with the defence of pass-on so that the claimant would not be unjustly enriched. The CJEU analysed the defence as an exception to the principle that taxes incompatible with EU law must be reimbursed: <i>Société Comateb v Directeur Générale des Douanes et Droits Indirects</i> (Joined Cases C-192/95 to C-218/95) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1997/C19295.html">[1997] ECR I-165</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1997/C19295.html">[1997] STC 1006</a>, para 21. The CJEU has limited the scope of that defence; it requires that the defence be interpreted strictly because it operates as a restriction upon the EU right to repayment of the unlawfully levied taxes. There can be no presumption that the unlawful charges have been passed on. Whether there has been a pass-on is a question of fact to be established on evidence adduced before the national court: <i>Société Comateb</i> (above) para 25; <i>Weber’s Wine World Handels-GmbH v Abgabenberufungskommission Wien </i>(Case C-147/01) [2005] All ER (EC) 224; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2003/C14701.html">[2003] ECR I-11365</a>; [2004] 1 CMLR 7, paras 93-97. The direct pass-on of a wrongly-levied tax is the sole exception to the right of reimbursement: <i>Lady &amp; Kid A/S v Skatteministeriet </i>(Case C-398/09) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C39809_J.html">[2012] All ER (EC) 410</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C39809_J.html">[2011] ECR I-7375</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C39809_J.html">[2012] 1 CMLR 14</a>, paras 20 and 26. In that case, the Court of Justice rejected an argument that the taxpayer would be unjustly enriched by repayment of an unlawful levy because the taxpayer would have benefited from the concomitant abolition of other levies charged on a different basis. The benefit of the saving arising from the abolition of the other levies could not be regarded as unjust enrichment in EU law and could not be set off against the burden of the unlawful levy: para 26.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In our view the reference in <i>Courage Ltd</i> to that paragraph in the <i>Hans Just</i> judgment is a recognition of the possibility and relevance of pass-on. It is not an oblique incorporation of any other rules concerning the right of a taxpayer to obtain restitution of taxes levied in breach of EU law, which is a claim with a different legal basis.</p>

We are not concerned on these appeals with the principle of equivalence. The only constraint on national law at the relevant time therefore was the principle of effectiveness which requires that the rules of domestic law do not make it practically impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights guaranteed by EU law.

In the legal systems of the United Kingdom pass-on is an element in the quantification of damages rather than a defence in a strict sense.

The case concerned a claim for damages resulting from the defendant’s (Koito’s) breach of contract through the late delivery and failure to deliver aircraft seats to Thai Airways for use in new aircraft which they had purchased. Thai Airways, facing a shortage of aircraft to perform its planned services, leased three aircraft on short-term operating leases to cover the gap in capacity and ordered replacement seats for its new aircraft from another supplier. It claimed as damages the costs which it incurred in mitigating its loss and its principal claim was for the cost of leasing the replacement aircraft. Leggatt J held that Thai Airways was entitled to recover among other things, the costs of leasing the replacement aircraft for two years. Thai Airways did not attempt to base its claim on an estimate of a net loss of profits measured by the differential between what its overall profits would have been if Koito had performed its contractual obligations and the profits which Thai Airways actually made during the period of the leases of the replacement aircraft. Having regard to the complexity of the arrangements by which the airline sought to maximise the efficiency of the use of its aircraft, that calculation would have been extremely complex.</p>

As sophisticated retailers, which obtain their supplies from many suppliers and sell a wide range of goods to many customers, they can respond to the imposition of a cost in a number of ways, as the CAT pointed out in paras 434 and 455 of its judgment. There are four principal options: (i) a merchant can do nothing in response to the increased cost and thereby suffer a corresponding reduction of profits or an enhanced loss; or (ii) the merchant can respond by reducing discretionary expenditure on its business such as by reducing its marketing and advertising budget or restricting its capital expenditure; or (iii) the merchant can seek to reduce its costs by negotiation with its many suppliers; or (iv) the merchant can pass on the costs by increasing the prices which it charges its customers. Which option or combination of options a merchant will adopt will depend on the markets in which it operates and its response may be influenced by whether the cost was one to which it alone was subjected or was one which was shared by its competitors. If the merchant were to adopt only option (i) or (ii) or a combination of them, its loss would be measured by the funds which it paid out on the overcharge because it would have been deprived of those funds for use in its business. Option (iii) might reduce the merchant’s loss. Option (iv) also would reduce the merchant’s loss except to the extent that it had a “volume effect”, if higher prices were to reduce the volume of its sales and thereby have an effect on the merchant’s profits.</a></p><a name="para205">

The statement of the Court of Appeal in para 324 of its judgment in the present case is an accurate statement of English law:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Whether or not the unlawful charge has been passed on is a question of fact, the burden of proving which lies on the defendant … who asserts it.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">But in the context of these appeals, as we discuss below, the significance of the legal burden should not be overstated.</p>

In such a case, it is for the defendant to show that the benefits should be set off against the prima facie claim of loss. For example, in <i>Thai Airways</i> (above) it fell to Koito to prove that the net benefits that the airline received as a result of leasing the replacement aircraft during the relevant period offset the losses which it suffered from the delayed entry into service of the aircraft for which Koito failed to supply the seats. Such cases raise delicate questions as to whether a benefit is sufficiently causally connected with the breach of contract or (in tort) the wrong or whether the benefit was the result of an independent commercial decision by the claimant.</a></p><a name="para212">

The benefit to be brought into account must have been caused either by the breach of the charterparty or by a successful act of mitigation”. In that case, by selling the vessel after the charterparty had been prematurely terminated the owners avoided a substantial capital loss occasioned by the collapse in the market for such vessels following the financial crisis in 2008. While the premature termination of the charterparty in <i>Fulton Shipping</i> was the occasion for the owners’ decision to sell the vessel, the court held that that decision was not necessitated by the termination but was a commercial decision of the owners at their own risk.</a></p><a name="para213">

As Leggatt J stated in <i>Thai Airways</i> at para 33, quoting from an article by A Dyson and A Kramer, “There is No ‘Breach Date Rule’: Mitigation, Difference in Value and Date of Assessment” (2014) 130 LQR 259, 263: “damages are assessed as if the claimant acted reasonably, if in fact it did not act reasonably”. Thus, for example in <i>Golden Strait Corpn v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha </i>(“<i>The Golden Victory</i>”) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/12.html">[2007] UKHL 12</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/12.html">[2007] 2 AC 353</a>, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated (at para 10):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An injured party such as the owners may not, generally speaking, recover damages against a repudiator such as the charterers for loss which he could reasonably have avoided by taking reasonable commercial steps to mitigate his loss. Thus where, as here, there is an available market for the chartering of vessels, the injured party’s loss will be calculated on the assumption that he has, on or within a reasonable time of accepting the repudiation, taken reasonable commercial steps to obtain alternative employment for the vessel for the best consideration reasonably obtainable.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para215">215.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not concerned in these appeals with additional benefits resulting from a victim’s response to a wrong which was an independent commercial decision or with any allegation of a failure to take reasonable commercial steps in response to a loss. The issue of mitigation which arises is whether in fact the merchants have avoided all or part of their losses. In the classic case of <i>British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1912/43.html">[1912] AC 673</a>, at 689 Viscount Haldane described the principle that the claimant cannot recover for avoided loss in these terms:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[W]hen in the course of his business [the claimant] has taken action <u>arising out of the transaction,</u> which action has diminished his loss, the effect in actual diminution of the loss he has suffered may be taken into account …” (Emphasis added)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Here also a question of legal or proximate causation arises as the underlined words show. But the question of legal causation is straightforward in the context of a retail business in which the merchant seeks to recover its costs in its annual or other regular budgeting. The relevant question is a factual question: has the claimant in the course of its business recovered from others the costs of the MSC, including the overcharge contained therein? The merchants, having acted reasonably, are entitled to recover their factual loss. If the court were to conclude on the evidence that the merchant had by reducing the cost of its supplies or by the pass-on of the cost to its customers (options (iii) and (iv) in para 205 above) transferred all or part of its loss to others, its true loss would not be the prima facie measure of the overcharge but a lesser sum.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para216">216.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal burden lies on the operators of the schemes to establish that the merchants have recovered the costs incurred in the MSC. But once the defendants have raised the issue of mitigation, in the form of pass-on, there is a heavy evidential burden on the merchants to provide evidence as to how they have dealt with the recovery of their costs in their business. Most of the relevant information about what a merchant actually has done to cover its costs, including the cost of the MSC, will be exclusively in the hands of the merchant itself. The merchant must therefore produce that evidence in order to forestall adverse inferences being taken against it by the court which seeks to apply the compensatory principle.</a></p><a name="para216"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The degree of precision required in establishing the extent of pass-on of an overcharge</p>

Justice is not achieved if a claimant receives less or more than its actual loss. But in applying the principle the court must also have regard to another principle, enshrined in the overriding objective of the Civil Procedure Rules, that legal disputes should be dealt with at a proportionate cost. The court and the parties may have to forgo precision, even where it is possible, if the cost of achieving that precision is disproportionate, and rely on estimates. The common law takes a pragmatic view of the degree of certainty with which damages must be pleaded and proved: <i>Devenish Nutrition Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis SA</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2394.html">[2007] EWHC 2394 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/1086.html">[2009] Ch 390</a>, 408, para 30 per Lewison J.</p>

Similarly, Lord Shaw in <i>Watson Laidlaw &amp; Co Ltd</i> (above, at 29 to 30) spoke of restoration by way of compensation being “accomplished to a large extent by the exercise of a sound imagination and the practice of the broad axe” and of the attempt of justice “to get back to the status quo ante in fact, or to reach imaginatively, by the process of compensation, a result in which the same principle is followed”. When the court deals with claims for personal injury, loss of life or loss of reputation, it has to put a monetary value on things that cannot be valued precisely. But the task of valuing claims for purely monetary losses may also lack precision if the compensatory principle is to be honoured, particularly when one is dealing with complex trading entities such as the merchants in these appeals. We see this for example in AAM’s alternative case which seeks to assess the loss of profit caused by the volume effect where the overcharge was passed on to their customers in the form of higher prices. Such a claim is likely to depend in considerable measure on economic opinion evidence and involve imprecise estimates.</a></p><a name="para218">

The assessment of damages based on the compensatory principle does not offend the principle of effectiveness provided that the court does not require unreasonable precision from the claimant.

The European Commission has issued “Guidelines for national courts on how to estimate the share of overcharge which was passed on to the indirect purchaser” (2019/C 267/07) (“the 2019 Guidelines”) in accordance with a power conferred by article 16 of the Damages Directive. The 2019 Guidelines make clear (para 12) that the compensatory principle “underlies the entire Damages Directive and must be understood as requiring that a person entitled to claim compensation for the harm suffered must be placed in the position in which that person would have been had the infringement not been committed”. It goes on to state that pass-on may be invoked by an infringer as a shield against a claim for damages and by an indirect purchaser as a sword to support the argument that it has suffered harm (paras 18-19).</a></p><a name="para220">

The power to estimate “requires national courts to, firstly, base their assessment on the information reasonably available and, secondly, strive for an approximation of the amount or share of passing-on which is plausible” (para 34). The 2019 Guidelines note that several member states already have rules which correspond to the power to estimate which the Damages Directive envisages and (in footnote 39) refer to Lord Shaw’s statement in <i>Watson, Laidlaw &amp; Co Ltd</i> (above) that harm may be quantified “by the exercise of a sound imagination and the practice of the broad axe”, and to the application of that statement by the Court of Appeal in <i>Devenish Nutrition Ltd</i> (above), para 110.</a></p><a name="para223">

It is the first and second conditions which are relevant for present purposes, namely that any given default MIF must: (i) contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress and (ii) allow consumers a fair share of the relevant benefits.</a></p><a name="para228">

Popplewell J considered that Mastercard had established its case that the default MIFs were exempt. A critical part of his reasoning was that part of the MIFs paid to issuers had been passed through to their cardholder customers in the form of incentives to encourage use of scheme credit or debit cards to purchase more goods from merchants, thereby providing (so Mastercard asserted) increased benefits for the merchants - “issuer pass-through”.</a></p><a name="para229"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para229"></a><a name="para230">230.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal considered this aspect of Popplewell J’s judgment at paras 211-271. It held that there were a number of flaws in the judge’s analysis. It noted that there was a critical gap in the evidence put forward by Mastercard: it did not provide evidence from issuers regarding the extent to which there was pass-through of the MIFs to cardholders, and had not attempted to obtain such evidence (paras 242-244). It was therefore impossible to tell to what extent (if at all) the cost to merchants of having to pay a default MIF in relation to each card transaction might be outweighed by countervailing benefits to them from use of MIF income to incentivise increased card use. The judge had failed to carry out this balancing exercise (paras 246-248). As the Court of Appeal noted at para 245, all that could be said was that the expert witnesses on each side agreed, purely on the basis of economic theory, that pass-through could incentivise card use; but there was no empirical, factual evidence on the point as would have been necessary to show that pass-through did in fact occur, the extent of it and whether incentives to cardholders would in fact have resulted in more use of scheme cards (as opposed to cardholders simply using their scheme cards all the time in any event, without being influenced by incentives, so that the merchants bore the cost of the MIFs without any corresponding benefit: the “always card transactions” point described at paras 250-251). Since Mastercard could not establish by evidence the extent of pass-through, it could not show the extent to which MIF revenue was used to incentivise card usage, nor whether and to what extent it did in fact stimulate additional card usage; and this was “fatal” to Mastercard’s case for exemption (paras 252-254).</a></p><a name="para230">

The court then proceeded to make further explicit rulings in paras 257-259 as follows:</a></p><a name="para231"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“257.&nbsp; The judge should have concluded that, in the absence of any evidence as to the actual extent of the pass-through, Mastercard had failed to establish by robust analysis and cogent evidence, or otherwise, a sufficient causal link between the default MIFs and any net benefits, so that their claim for exemption under article 101(3) failed.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">258.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … [T]he judge should have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before him, that the first condition of article 101(3), the benefits requirement, was not satisfied so that Mastercard had not established entitlement to an exemption under article 101(3).</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">259.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … [Further, in relation to the second condition for an exemption under article 101(3), the fair share requirement, on the evidence advanced at trial by Mastercard] had the judge carried out the necessary balancing exercise, he would inevitably have concluded that Mastercard could not satisfy the second condition either.”</p>

According to the order, it is not open to any party to advance a new case or to adduce any fresh evidence on the remittals for reconsideration of Mastercard’s and Visa’s cases in each set of proceedings for exemption under article 101(3), but “the parties to each of the proceedings may rely on evidence from the other two proceedings if and only to the extent that it is relevant to the case on exemption advanced in the proceedings in question”.</a></p><a name="para233">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We take the view that, despite what we have said above, it is not certain that, had Popplewell J had the benefit of this judgment and thus been fully aware of the need for empirical data and facts in order to prove an exemption, MasterCard’s case on article 101(3) would have failed in its entirety. It is possible, bearing in mind the acceptance by Sainsbury’s and the CAT in the other two cases that there was a lawful level of MIF, that the judge would have found that there was some exemptible level of MIF, albeit a lower one than he in fact found. Altogether removing the article 101(3) issue from reconsideration could therefore result in an unjustified windfall for the AAM parties. It seems far more just to us that the issue should be reconsidered in all three cases, based on the same principles, by the same tribunal. There is no real injustice to the AAM parties in the course we propose, since the windfall to which we have referred would have arisen from the procedural mishap caused by the separation of three cases raising almost identical issues. If the CAT is now able to reach a consistent conclusion in all three cases on the exemption and quantum issues, that will produce a fair and just outcome for all the parties. It would be a triumph of form over substance if we were to hold that we were unable to reach a just solution simply as a result of a procedural accident.”</p>

We accept the submission of Mr Jon Turner QC for AAM that the Court of Appeal has erred in principle by allowing Mastercard to re-open the article 101(3) issue on which, as the Court of Appeal held, it had lost after a full and fair trial of the issue. This offends against the strong principle of public policy and justice that there should be finality in litigation, which the Court of Appeal did not take properly into account. The court was wrong to characterise victory for AAM as “an unjustified windfall” or the product of a “procedural mishap” or “accident”. It was wrong to say that re-opening the article 101(3) issue involved “no real injustice” for AAM.</a></p><a name="para237">

When a legal claim has finally been determined in litigation, a cause of action estoppel arises and it cannot be reopened. A binding issue estoppel may arise in respect of a matter, other than a legal claim, which is directly the subject of determination in proceedings. Further, parties are generally required to bring forward their whole case in one action, and attempts to revisit matters that have already been the subject of a determination (even if not formally a matter of cause of action estoppel or the subject of an issue estoppel) are liable to be barred as an abuse of process: <i>Henderson v Henderson </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>, 114-116 per Wigram V-C; <i>Johnson v Gore-Wood &amp; Co </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/65.html">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>, 31 per Lord Bingham of Cornhill and 58-59 per Lord Millett; <i>Virgin Atlantic </i>(above). Under this rule, first explored in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>, a party is precluded “from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but could and should have been raised in the earlier ones” (<i>Virgin Atlantic</i>, para 17). As Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) explained in <i>Barrow v Bankside Members Agency Ltd </i>[1996] 1 WLR 257, 260:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> … requires the parties, when a matter becomes the subject of litigation between them in a court of competent jurisdiction, to bring their whole case before the court so that all aspects of it may be finally decided … once and for all. In the absence of special circumstances, the parties cannot return to the court to advance arguments, claims or defences which they could have put forward for decision on the first occasion but failed to raise. The rule is not based on the doctrine of res judicata in a narrow sense, nor even on any strict doctrine of issue or cause of action estoppel. It is a rule of public policy based on the desirability, in the general interest as well as that of the parties themselves, that litigation should not drag on forever and that a defendant should not be oppressed by successive suits when one would do. That is the abuse at which the rule is directed.”</p>

The trial before Popplewell J was a final trial between AAM and Mastercard of the issues between them under article 101(1) and 101(3) so far as affected Mastercard’s liability to AAM. In preparing for the trial, Mastercard was aware of the significance of the issue of pass-through, not least because attention had been called to that issue in the Mastercard Commission Decision (as noted in para 243 in the judgment of the Court of Appeal). In any event, the issue of pass-through was central to the way in which Mastercard sought to justify its claim for exemption under article 101(3). It had a full and fair opportunity to adduce any evidence it wished in respect of that claim. Yet, as the Court of Appeal found (at para 244), it did not attempt to obtain factual, empirical evidence on that issue, choosing instead to support its claim of exemption under article 101(3) by reference to economic theory.</a></p><a name="para240">

We agree with Mr Turner’s submission that in circumstances where: (i) in a final trial between private litigants to determine their rights and obligations inter se each side has had a fair opportunity to bring forward all the evidence that it wants to bring forward in support of its case, and (ii) where the appellate court has concluded that, on the basis of that evidence, one party ought to have won, the court should dispose of the matter by awarding a final remedy that reflects that outcome. This is necessary to do justice to the parties (so that the party that has won in a fair - and it might be added, very expensive - contest is not deprived of the fruits of its victory), to achieve finality, and to avoid the court enlarging the dispute outside the way in which the parties have chosen to frame it.</a></p><a name="para241">

The function of the judge is to adjudicate on those issues alone.” As Lord Wilberforce stated in <i>Air Canada v Secretary of State for Trade </i>[1983] 2 AC 394, 438:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In a contest purely between one litigant and another … the task of the court is to do, and be seen to be doing, justice between the parties … There is no higher or additional duty to ascertain some independent truth. It often happens, from the imperfection of evidence, or the withholding of it, sometimes by the party in whose favour it would tell if presented, that an adjudication has to be made which is not, and is known not to be, the whole truth of the matter: yet if the decision has been in accordance with the available evidence and with the law, justice will have been fairly done.”</p>

Suppose Popplewell J had determined the issues before him as the Court of Appeal held they should have been determined by him (ie on the basis that Mastercard’s defence under article 101(3) failed) and there had been no need for an appeal. He would have made a final order in AAM’s favour in 2017 giving judgment for them on their article 101(1) claim (necessarily thereby rejecting the article 101(3) defence), and that order would have constituted a cause of action estoppel in their favour. There could have been no question of Mastercard seeking to reopen that order by seeking to litigate again on the same issues, by relying on new evidence as adduced in other proceedings. It is difficult to see how it could be right for the Court of Appeal to produce a different outcome by reason of the adventitious circumstance that AAM had to go through the process of appeal to arrive at the result it was entitled to have achieved at first instance. Alternatively, one could analyse the outcome which would have been arrived at in relation to the article 101(3) defence as a matter of issue estoppel, and the same point could be made. Or again, one could analyse the position by reference to the rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> and say that it would have been an abuse of process for Mastercard to have sought to re-open the article 101(3) issue by reference to new evidence, the substance of which it had had the opportunity to adduce previously at trial before Popplewell J. Since it would have been unjust to allow an application by Mastercard to do that, it is difficult to see how it could be compatible with justice for the Court of Appeal to produce that same outcome by its exercise of discretion on its own initiative under CPR rule 52.20(2). On the contrary, in our view it was contrary to justice and to the overriding objective for the Court of Appeal to make the order it did in the AAM proceedings. It was also contrary to CPR rule 52.20(2) itself, on its proper construction, since under CPR rule 1.2(b) that provision falls to be interpreted in a way which is in conformity with the overriding objective.</a></p><a name="para244">

However, we also consider the comments made by the Court of Appeal at para 366 (above) to be misplaced. If it is decided by the CAT after the further hearing in the Mastercard Sainsbury’s proceedings and the Visa Sainsbury’s proceedings that, on the evidence and concessions made by Sainsbury’s in those proceedings (concessions with which AAM do not agree and which they consider to be baseless and wrongly made), there was some level of MIFs which would have been exempt under article 101(3), with the result that Sainsbury’s claims for damages for breach of article 101(1) would be reduced, that would in no way show that there was an unjustified windfall for AAM arising out of a final order in their favour in the AAM proceedings. As the Court of Appeal rightly held, after the fair trial which took place, the judge should have found that AAM succeeded in its claim. That result is not a windfall, nor is it unjustified. It is the just outcome of the contest fought by the parties in those proceedings.</a></p><a name="para245">

The fact would still remain that, as events transpired, Mastercard had lost to AAM at trial after a fair hearing on the issues between them. However, in any event, in our view it is not correct to characterise the way in which the AAM proceedings were dealt with separately from the other proceedings and went forward to be dealt with at a separate trial as being the result of a procedural mishap or accident. There are many sets of interchange damages claims pending against Mastercard and Visa (and other card system operators) in the court system, and it would be wholly impracticable for them all to be tried together at the same time. In a sensible and responsible way, Visa, Mastercard, Sainsbury’s and AAM debated at various stages whether the proceedings involving them could be case managed or heard together, and on each occasion the judgment was made that there were good reasons why they should not be. The fact that there have been three separate trials in the three sets of proceedings is not the result of any procedural accident, but rather of deliberate and informed choices made by the parties, courts and the CAT as to how these complex claims should be determined within the court system. It may also be observed that, contrary to what the Court of Appeal seems to have thought it would achieve by ordering a combined hearing in the CAT in the three sets of proceedings at issue in this appeal, that combined hearing will not produce a single, comprehensive determination of liability in relation to the other interchange fee damages claims. Those other claims will have to be determined in each case on the basis of the pleadings and the evidence adduced in that case.</a></p><a name="para246"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion on AAM’s cross-appeal</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para246"></a><a name="para247">247.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given above, AAM’s cross-appeal is allowed. The order made by the Court of Appeal will be varied, to substitute an order declaring that the relevant MIFs charged to AAM in the relevant period were contrary to article 101(1) (and the equivalent provisions of UK and Irish competition law); and that Mastercard has failed to discharge the burden on it of demonstrating that a MIF set at any positive level would have met the test for exemption under article 101(3) (and the equivalent provisions of UK and Irish law). If not settled, the AAM proceedings should then proceed to a trial on the issue of quantum of damages.</a></p><a name="para247"> </a></div><a name="para247">
