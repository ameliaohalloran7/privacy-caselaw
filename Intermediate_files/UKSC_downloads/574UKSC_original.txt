</span>This appeal raises significant issues regarding the procedures whereby,
firstly, magistrates may issue warrants to enter and search premises and seize
property under section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”),
secondly, Crown courts may, under section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police
Act 2001 (“CJPA”), order the retention by the police of unlawfully seized
material on the grounds that, if returned, the material would be immediately
susceptible to lawful seizure and, thirdly persons affected may challenge such
decisions by judicial review. Central to the issues is whether the relevant
judicial authorities are, under the principle in <i>Al Rawi v Security Service</i>

authorisation to conduct a closed material procedure, precluded at each or any
of these stages from having regard to information which, on public interest
grounds, cannot be disclosed to any person affected who wishes to challenge the
warrant or any seizure or order for retention under section 59.</p>

on 16 June 2014 by St Albans Magistrates’ Court (JL Grimsey JP) of two search

and Unit 5, Island Blue Ltd, Overbury Road, Harringay (said to be addresses at
which the appellant Mr John Haralambous respectively lived and was suspected to
have a business interest) and from their execution on 26 June 2014 by entry and
seizure of a number of items. The warrants were issued following an <i>ex parte

Hertfordshire Constabulary, under section 8 of PACE. The appellant was also
arrested on 26 June 2014 and bailed. Any further investigation by the police of
any matter to which such warrants and arrest related has been suspended pending
the outcome of these proceedings.</span></a></p><a name="para5">

23 September by District Judge Mellanby. The appellant was provided from the
court’s file with JL Grimsey’s written statement dated 16 June 2014 of reasons
for issuing the warrants, namely “because of the substantial evidence that
linked all the subjects together and the addresses”, and was informed that the
evidence, which was being withheld, consisted of two closely typed pages. On 25
September 2014 District Judge Mellanby issued her open reasons for refusing the
application for disclosure of the redacted and withheld information, and on the
next day she handed the second respondent a closed judgment.</p>

alleged deficiencies in the terms in which the application could be seen to
have been expressed. They also included the appellant’s central contention that
the information disclosed to him showed no basis on which lawful search

served a protective application for retention of the seized material under
section 59 of the CJPA. On 9 June 2015 HHJ Bright QC sitting in the St Albans
Crown Court ruled that the second respondent was entitled to rely on the
withheld information in support of its section 59 application, and on 11 June
2015, in the light of this ruling, the parties agreed and HHJ Bright QC made an
order authorising retention of the seized material under section 59.</span></a></p><a name="para8">

In response to an application by the second respondent for directions to allow
the Divisional Court, should it wish, to see the withheld information in an <i>ex
parte </i>hearing, the appellant accepted that, if HHJ Bright QC had been
entitled to have regard to the withheld information, then the lawfulness of his
ruling was not in issue; the only issue was whether he was so entitled; and
only if he was not, did the section 59 order fall to be quashed. Collins J on
20 January 2016 left it to the Divisional Court to decide at the hearing
whether it should see the withheld information.</span></a></p><a name="para9">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Divisional Court decided not
to hold an <i>ex parte</i> hearing and that it did not need to consider the

appellant’s claim for judicial review: </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/916.html">[2016] 1 WLR 3073</a>. It held that it was
open to a magistrate issuing a search and seizure warrant and a court deciding
an application under section 59 to consider material which had in the public
interest to be withheld from disclosure. It evidently took the same view in
relation to a magistrates’ court hearing an application for disclosure pursuant
to the procedure indicated in <i>Bangs </i>(para 6 above), although it wrongly
referred to that procedure as one for challenging the issue or execution of a
warrant. It is common ground between the parties before the Supreme Court that
magistrates’ court decisions to issue a search and seizure warrant and Crown
Court orders under section 59 are challengeable only by judicial review, which
is the means the appellant correctly adopted. Finally, the Divisional Court
noted that it had been no part of the argument before it that, if HHJ Bright QC
had been correct to decide that the appellant should be denied access to the
withheld information, his decision should still be quashed. It referred to <i>R
(AHK) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/1117.html">[2012] EWHC 1117 (Admin)</a>;

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The assumption behind these questions is that no express
Parliamentary authorisation exists for the operation of a closed material
procedure at any stage. The appellant’s case was that the Justice and Security
Act 2013 has no application, because proceedings relating to a search warrant
or under section 59 of the CJPA are criminal in nature, not civil. The second
respondent took no issue with this, but the Secretary of State for the Home
Department as intervener suggested an alternative basis on which the 2013 Act
would not apply (namely that it applies only where disclosure would be damaging
to the interests of “national security”). No detailed submissions were
addressed to these points, and the Court is content simply to proceed on the
basis of the common ground that, for one reason or another, the 2013 Act does
not apply. In the absence of any such express statutory authorisation, the
appellant’s submission is that the common law principle in <i>Al Rawi </i>applies
to preclude any form of closed material procedure.</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Although the agreed issues refer
to the person who is “the subject of the warrant”, this does not reflect the
actual language or effect of sections 8 and 15 of PACE. The subject of any
warrant under those sections is premises, falling into one of two categories.
The first category consists of specific premises, specified in the application.
The present warrants fall into that category. The second category consists of
“any premises occupied or controlled by a person specified in the application”.
The pre-conditions to issue of a warrant set out in section 8(3) also refer to
any “person entitled to grant entry to the premises” as well as to any “person
entitled to grant access to the evidence” - who may or may not be the same or
different persons. Again that does not mean that the warrant is addressed to
any such person. There are, of course, likely to be persons whose interests are
affected by the operation of a search and seizure order. Very often they will
be persons occupying the relevant premises and in possession of the property
seized. Sometimes there may be persons with privacy or confidentiality rights
in respect of property seized. But this will not necessarily be the case. A
search and seizure warrant may have as its aim and effect to obtain material
relating to some third person with no proprietary, possessory or other interest
in the material seized at all. The material may assist the investigation, and
very possibly provide evidence against the third person. The occupier of the
premises or person in possession of the material before its seizure may not
make any challenge to the warrant or its execution. It is not clear that the
third person would necessarily have any basis for doing so.</span></a></p><a name="para12">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant’s primary case,
advanced by Mr Mark Summers QC, is that it is not permissible for a magistrate
or court, at any of the stages identified in issues (i) to (iv), to have regard
to or rely on material which will on public interest grounds have to be
withheld from a person affected by the order made. Alternatively, if it is legitimate
for a magistrate on a section 8 application and/or a Crown Court judge on a
section 59 application to have regard to and rely on material so withheld,
there is no basis on which a court can, consistently with <i>Al Rawi</i>, do so
on a judicial review challenge to the warrant or the section 59 order. Mr
Summers invites the Supreme Court, when considering these issues, to start with
the end position as it exists on an application for judicial review. If
material has on public interest grounds to be withheld from the applicant then,
it cannot, he submits, have been legitimate for it to be deployed at any
earlier stage. Finally, if these submissions are not accepted, Mr Summers
submits that neither a section 8 nor a section 59 order can withstand challenge
by a person affected, unless that person has been supplied with the “gist” of
the information relied upon to obtain it.</span></a></p><a name="para13">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Martin Chamberlain QC for the
second respondent and Mr James Eadie QC for the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, as intervener, advance a contrary case at each stage. In their
submission, both the magistrate under section 8 and a court under section 59
are entitled to rely on material which will have to be withheld from disclosure
to a person affected. A court on judicial review is either entitled to adopt a
similar procedure or, if it cannot, must simply assume that the material
withheld justified the orders made under section 8 and/or 59. Further, although
a search and seizure warrant involves an invasion of private property, the
invasion does not, in their submission, equate with the infringements of
liberty involved in previous cases, involving for example detention or a
control or asset freezing order, where “gisting” of the substance of the
material relied on has been regarded as essential. In considering the issues,
Mr Chamberlain and Mr Eadie invite the Court to start with the initial
application for a warrant and follow the process through each of the potential
subsequent stages. There is in my opinion a logic in this last submission,
since it means considering the statutory scheme from the ground up. It also
takes the same starting point as the agreed issues. But I agree that it is
important to review any conclusions reached about the earlier stages of the
process in the light of whatever analysis is adopted of its later stages.</span></a></p><a name="para14">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In order for a magistrate to be
able to issue a warrant under section 8(1) read with section 15(3) and (4), all
that is required is that he or she be satisfied, from the information contained
in the constable’s application and from the constable’s answers on oath to any
questions put, that “there are reasonable grounds for believing” the matters
set out in section 8(1)(a) to (e). Nothing in the language of these sections
suggests that the material giving rise to such grounds must be of any
particular nature, or take any particular form, or itself be admissible in
evidence at any trial that might be envisaged. In the context of a procedure
designed to be operated speedily by a constable at an early stage in a police
investigation, that is unsurprising. It is also clear, and common ground, that
the statutory scheme of sections 8 and 15 of PACE is designed to operate <i>ex
parte</i>. Section 15(3) makes express provision to that effect, and the
pre-conditions to the operation of the scheme, set out in section 8(3), underline
the point. The execution of the warrant for search and seizure may lead to the
obtaining of material that may itself either be, or lead in due course to the
obtaining of, evidence. Such evidence will only be capable of being deployed at
any trial of any person who may be charged with any offence if it is disclosed:

operates at a stage preliminary to any trial and before any issue of guilt or
innocence is joined with any particular person.</p>

addressed a number of issues that had been raised with reference to article 8
of the European Convention on Human Rights, and then noted that a question had
also arisen as to whether there was any “lawful justification” for supplying to
a citizen whose home had been entered pursuant to a search warrant a copy of
the relevant information on which the warrant was based. As to this, Lord Woolf
CJ said (para 29):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Information may contain details
of an informer which it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal. The
information may also contain other statements to which public interest immunity
might apply. But, subject to that, if a person who is in the position of this
claimant asks perfectly sensibly for a copy of the information, then speaking
for myself I can see no objection to a copy of that information being provided.
The citizen, in my judgment, should be entitled to be able to assess whether an
information contains the material which justifies the issue of a warrant. This
information contained the necessary evidence to justify issuing the warrant.”</p>

warrants. It described the grant and execution of a search and seizure warrant
as “a serious infringement of the liberty of the subject, which needs to be
clearly justified” (para 24(1)). Its last two conclusions were as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remedy which is
available to a person or persons affected by a warrant is to seek judicial
review. It is an adequate remedy because the statutory provisions have to be
read in the light of those articles of the European Convention which are now
part of English law. In fact, ... if the statutory provisions are satisfied the
requirements of article 8 of the Convention will also be satisfied, and at
least since the implementation of the Human Rights Act an application for
judicial review is not bound to fail if, for example, the applicant cannot show
that the Director’s decision to seek a warrant in a particular form was
irrational, but in deciding whether to grant permission to apply for judicial
review the High Court will always bear in mind that the seizure of documents
pursuant to a warrant is an investigative step, perhaps best reconsidered either
at or even after the trial.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often it may not be
appropriate, even after the warrant has been executed, to disclose to the person
affected or his legal representatives all of the material laid before the
district judge because to do so might alert others or frustrate the purposes of
the overall inquiry, but the person affected has a right to be satisfied as to
the legality of the procedure which led to the execution of the warrant, and if
he or his representatives do ask to see what was laid before the district judge
and to be told about what happened at the hearing, there should, so far as
possible, be an accommodating response to that request. It is not sufficient to
say that the applicant has been adequately protected because discretion has
been exercised first by the Director and then by the district judge. In order
to respond to the request of an applicant it may be that permission for
disclosure has to be sought from an investigating authority abroad, and/or that
what was produced or said to the district judge can only be disclosed in an
edited form, but judicial control by way of judicial review cannot operate
effectively unless the person or persons affected are put in a position to take
meaningful advice, and if so advised to seek relief from the court. Furthermore
it is no answer to say that there is no general duty of disclosure in
proceedings for judicial review.”</p>

review two warrants issued by HHJ Stephens QC on an <i>ex parte</i> application
under section 9, read with Schedule 1 paragraph 12 to PACE. The warrants
authorised HMRC to search premises occupied by the two claimants and seize
documents there. Until the morning of the hearing, HMRC maintained that it
could not disclose the information on the basis of which the warrants had been
issued, for fear of prejudicing the continuing investigation which was not
confined to the claimants. However, on the morning of the hearing HMRC provided
a document giving the “gist” of its case, and a redacted transcript of the
hearing before HHJ Stephens QC. Gross LJ made five numbered observations,
including these:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“27.(2) &nbsp;When an application for
judicial review is launched seeking to quash the grant of a search warrant, it
is, again, in some respects, akin to the ‘return date’ for <i>Marevas, Anton
Pillers </i>and <i>Restraint Orders</i>. Ordinarily, the expectation will be
that the party challenging the grant of the warrant must be entitled to know
the basis upon which the warrant was obtained.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">28.(3) &nbsp;By their nature, criminal
investigations are such that there will be occasions when, for good reason,
HMRC (or other authorities as the case may be) will not be able to divulge the full
information or the full contents of the discussion before the judge who granted
the warrant. There is an important public interest in combating economic crime,
and HMRC’s proper efforts to do so should not be undermined.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">30.(5) &nbsp;Where full disclosure
cannot be given (and there will be cases where it cannot be), HMRC should, if
at all possible, and again unless there is good reason for not doing so, make

</span></a></span><a name="para19"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Davis J addressed the same
subject, saying:</span></a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“77.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must not be overlooked
that an order issuing a warrant of the kind sought and granted in this case is,
by its very nature, highly intrusive. Hence indeed the stringent pre-conditions
under the 1984 Act Parliament has stipulated should be fulfilled before such an
order may be made. Further, such orders are ordinarily, as here, sought on an <i>ex
parte</i> basis: a reversal of course (albeit on well established grounds) of
the usual rule that a party is entitled to be heard before any order is granted
against him. Those two considerations seem to me to indicate that the prima
facie starting point should be for HMRC to give, where requested, to the person
who may be aggrieved at the issuing of the warrant and who may wish to
challenge it, as much relevant information as practicable, provided it is not
prejudicial to the investigation, as to the basis on which the warrant was
obtained from the Crown Court.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is of course
relatively easy to envisage that there may be many cases where it could indeed
be prejudicial to the investigation, prior to any charging decision, to
disclose parts of the information and other materials deployed before the Crown
Court judge in seeking the warrant. Non-disclosure in such circumstances can be
justified. In the present case for example, we are told that a 59-page information
and three supporting folders of materials were placed before the judge. Those
have not thus far, in their full terms, been disclosed to Mr Gittins, and
indeed Mr Jones QC did not seek to say they should have been, at all events at
this stage. But, to repeat, it is not legitimate to move, without additional
justification, from a position whereby it can properly be said that not all the
materials placed before the Crown Court judge should be disclosed, to a
position whereby it can be said that the recipient of the warrant is to be told
nothing at all as to the basis on which the warrant was sought.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, therefore,
in each case where a request for such information is made by the person the
subject of a warrant of the kind made here, HMRC should consider such requests
on a individuated basis. Specifically, HMRC should assess what materials and
information relied on before the Crown Court can properly be disclosed, with or
without editing, and whether by way of summary or otherwise, without prejudicing
the criminal investigation. It would be wrong simply to hide behind an asserted
general policy as a justification in itself for declining to give any
information. Indeed, I suspect that, while there perhaps may be cases where
declining to give any information at all may be justified in particular
circumstances, such a situation is likely to be an exception. Certainly it
should not be taken as a norm. Where such a situation is said by HMRC to arise,
then HMRC should be prepared to justify it. It is indeed, as I see it, salutary
that that should be so.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is clear (from paras 78 and 79 in particular of his
judgment) that Davis J contemplated that there could be put before, and relied
on by, the circuit judge information, some or even all of which would have to
be withheld on public interest grounds from a person affected by, and wishing
by judicial review to challenge, the warrants.</p>

15 to 21 above, the procedure, whereby information put before and used by the

PII (public interest immunity) procedure. Conventionally, a PII procedure
exists when a court assesses whether material should be disclosed to the other
party, in which case it will be known on all sides, or should in the public
interest be withheld from use by anyone, including the court: see <i>Al Rawi v
Security Service</i> (para 1 above), paras 100-104; <i>R (British Sky Broadcasting

procedure will then include an assessment of the significance of the material
in the context of whatever decision is in issue (here, the issue of the
warrant) and any challenge to it. However, I understand some of the dicta in
the above authorities in a different sense. They contemplate that the
magistrate in the case of an <i>ex parte </i>application for a warrant under
section 8 of PACE, or the Crown Court judge, in the case of such an <i>ex parte
</i>application under section 9 of PACE, will or may have been persuaded by
material some, or even all, of which will at the later stage of a claim for
disclosure under the principle in <i>Bangs</i> or for judicial review of the
issue of the warrant, have to be withheld from the applicant on public interest
grounds: see eg <i>EFT</i>, para 10, G<i>ittins</i>, paras 65-66 and <i>Bangs</i>,
para 25. The authorities do not directly address the question of what a court
hearing a judicial review application can or should do if it appears that the
material withheld is likely to be decisive for a consideration of the
legitimacy or otherwise of the issue of the warrant.</p>

helpfully sent by him to the Supreme Court, and we invited and received the

of a search warrant issued <i>ex parte </i>under section 28 of the Competition
Act 1998. Section 28 can itself be regarded for present purposes as broadly
paralleling section 8 of PACE. But the relevant Practice Directions provide not
only that a warrant under section 28 must be served as soon as possible on the
occupier or person appearing to be in charge of the premises (PD paras 7.3 and
8.1), but also that such occupier or person may apply to vary or discharge the
warrant to the judge who issued the warrant or, if he is not available, another
High Court judge (para 9). Concordia applied accordingly, but the Competition and
Markets Authority (“CMA”) maintained that it could not, for public interest
reasons, disclose all the information on the basis of which it had persuaded

</span>The current Criminal Procedure Rules, as amended since the events giving
rise to the present proceedings, contain provisions reflecting and regulating
the procedure contemplated in the authorities discussed in paras 15 to 21
above. They expressly permit information to be placed before a magistrate under
section 8 of PACE (rule 47.26(4)</a><a name="_Hlk500424994">), in circumstances to
which rule 5.7 (see below) applies, </a><a name="_Hlk500430846">marked to show
that it is only for the magistrate or court and not to be supplied to anyone
else, and accompanied with an explanation as to why it is withheld</a>. They go
on to provide a number of safeguards. An application for a search warrant
cannot be dealt with without a hearing (rule 47.25(1)). The applicant officer
must confirm on oath or affirmation that the application discloses all
information material to the decision the court must make, that the contents of
the application are true, and that he has disclosed anything known or reported
to him which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining any of the
grounds (rules 47.25(4) and (5) and 47.26(3) and (5)). He must also answer any questions
on oath or affirmation (rule 47.25(5)). An application must also include a
declaration by an officer senior to the applicant that the senior has reviewed
and authorised it (rule 47.26(5)(b)). The hearing, however, is required to be
in private unless the court otherwise determines, and in the absence of any
person affected by the warrant, including any person in occupation or control
of the premises (rule 47.25(1)). Rule 5.7 makes detailed provision for
circumstances in which information is sought by a party or person about the
grounds on which an order was made, or a warrant issued, in his absence, and
the person who applied for the order or warrant objects to the supply of the
information requested. The notice of objection must in this situation mark the
material to the disclosure of which the objection relates to show it is only
for the court and give an explanation why it has been withheld (rule 5.7(8)).
The hearing which follows may take place, wholly or in part, in the absence of
the party or person applying for information, and in the event the general rule
(though the court may direct other arrangements) is that the court will
consider representations first by the party or person applying for information
and then by the objector in the presence of both, and then further
representations by the objector, in the absence of that party or person (rule
5.7(9)). Rule 47.39 (introduced by SI 2017/144) also contains in relation to
applications under section 59 of the CJPA provisions regarding the marking of
information to show that, unless the court otherwise directs, it is only for
the court, accompanied with an explanation as to why it has been withheld,
together with provisions mirroring those in rule 5.7(9).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These provisions contemplate that the magistrate on an application for a
warrant under section 8 or for disclosure, or the Crown Court under section 59
of the CJPA, will be able to see and rely on information which in the public
interest cannot be disclosed to a person affected by the relevant order who
would otherwise be entitled to disclosure of the information. Mr Summers
submits that these provisions were in that respect <i>ultra vires</i>. One may
surmise that this submission is made on the basis that the general power under
section 69 of the Courts Act 2003 to make rules of procedure governing the
practice and procedure in the criminal courts cannot tacitly authorise a
departure from so fundamental a principle as the administration of open, <i>inter
partes</i> justice. I express no view on that submission. It falls away if the
statutory scheme of PACE and the CJPA itself permits the relevant magistrate or
court to have regard to material which cannot on public interest grounds be
disclosed to a person affected by a warrant or order.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, the statutory scheme of sections 8 and 15 of PACE does so
permit. Read in terms, it involves, as indicated in paras 12 and 15 above, a
purely <i>ex parte </i>process, directed to premises, rather than any
particular person. It is a process designed to be operated speedily and simply,
on the basis of information provided by a constable satisfying a magistrate
that there are reasonable grounds for believing the matters stated in section
8(1). There is nothing in the statutory scheme which expressly restricts the
information on which the magistrate may act. Parliament made no express
provision for the information on which the warrant was sought to take any
particular form or to be disclosed, even after the issue of the warrant, to any
person affected. It would in many cases clearly be impracticable to expect such
disclosure, for example where the information came from an informer, and in
particular where it came from an informer whose identity could readily be
identified from the nature of the information. I note, in parenthesis, that the
police may well be under a duty, for example under articles 2 and 3 of the
Human Rights Convention, to protect the safety of such an informer. Another
area where disclosure to a person affected would clearly be impracticable would
be where it would reveal the particular lines or methods of investigation being
or proposed to be followed, in a way which would or could undermine their
continuing usefulness in relation to other aspects of, or other persons
potentially involved in, the investigation. The rules which I have summarised
in para 25 above make very clear that the police owe a duty of candour towards
the magistrate when seeking a warrant, and may well have to disclose such
information, eg because it is material, or if asked by the magistrate. The
suggestion that the police should in such a case simply refrain from seeking or
further seeking a warrant would limit use by the police of important sources of
information and the efficacy of police investigations. It is no doubt sensible
practice for applicant officers to adopt, where practicable and where time
permits, the permissive rule 47.26(4) procedure and to identify information
which they contend ought not to be supplied to anyone but the court. That may
reduce the risk of accidental disclosure, and no doubt a magistrate considering
an application would, where this is done, bear in mind that there is
information which a person affected might never be able to test. But there is
no suggestion, or I think likelihood, that the scheme intended the constable or
magistrate at this early stage, when speed is often of the essence, to try to
form a definitive view as to what the public interest might ultimately prove to
require. That is an exercise which in accordance with the rules falls to be
undertaken at a later stage by a magistrate under the procedure in <i>Bangs </i>and/or
a Crown Court under section 59 of the CJPA. The effect of the statutory scheme
and the rules is that an application for a warrant under section 8 can be made
and granted on the basis of all the relevant information available to the
applicant, even though some of it may not at any stage be capable of being
disclosed to a person affected. The courts and the rule-makers, in developing
ancillary principles and protections for persons affected, have been careful to
qualify them, by reference to the public interest, so as not to undermine the
efficacy of the scheme. That would be the effect of the appellant’s case.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1979/5.html">[1980] AC 952</a>. Section 20C enabled the appropriate judicial officer (<i>in casu</i>,
the Common Serjeant) to issue such a warrant:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[i]f … satisfied on information
on oath given by an officer of the board that … there is reasonable ground for
suspecting that an offence involving any form of fraud in connection with, or

on premises specified in the information ...”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">A warrant was issued and executed in relation to
specified premises, including those of Rossminster Ltd, a banking company. No
information was given to Rossminster Ltd about the precise nature of the
alleged fraud, or when or by whom it was committed. Rossminster Ltd applied for
judicial review to have the warrant quashed and the documents which had been
seized delivered up.</p>

some information as regards the person(s) who are alleged to have committed an

certainly have been laid before the board and the judge. But the occupier has
no right to be told of this at this stage, nor has he the right to be informed

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The reference to a general public
interest immunity covering investigations into possible criminal offences may
need qualification. Indeed, in the judgment of the Divisional Court in <i>Rossminster</i>,
which was approved by the House of Lords, Eveleigh LJ suggested a more focused
approach, depending on the particular circumstances: </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1979/5.html">[1980] AC 952</a>, 961D-E. A
specific public interest is however accepted or assumed to exist in relation to
withholding of the material not disclosed to the appellant in this case. As to
the words in the passage cited “at this stage”, Lord Wilberforce went on to
note, with reference to a statement by Lord Reid in <i>Conway v Rimmer</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/2.html">[1968] AC 910</a>, 953-954, that, after a verdict or a decision not to take
proceedings, “there is not the same need for secrecy” (p 999D-E) and “the
immunity which exists at the stage of initial investigation will lapse” (p
1001A). However, where, at the stage which the present investigation has
reached (pending the outcome of the present appeal), it is accepted that there
is a current and continuing public interest in withholding information relied
on for the issue of the warrant, that qualification has no application. The
interests of other investigations, current or future, may also require the
withholding of information in some circumstances.</p>

warrant and a warrant to search premises and seize stolen goods at common law
(later the subject of section 42 of the Larceny Act 1916) was referred to by
Lord Diplock and Lord Scarman at pp 1010H and 1023H-1024A in the <i>Rossminster

been in the mind of those drafting and enacting section 8 of PACE to
crystallise the statutory position relating to ordinary search and seizure
warrants.</span></a></p><a name="para32">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Summers submits that the <i>Rossminster</i>
case is the product of an earlier era. It is true that it was decided both
before the Convention rights were domesticated by the Human Rights Act 1998 and
before the decision in <i>Al Rawi</i>. But PACE itself was also enacted in the
same era, not long after the decision in <i>Rossminster</i>. There may be other
aspects of the decision in <i>Rossminster</i> which require reconsideration in
the light of subsequent developments. But on the present issue - whether the
scheme of PACE contemplates that a magistrate on an application for a warrant
under section 8 or for disclosure under <i>Bangs</i>, or the Crown Court on an
application under section 59 of the CJPA, may rely on material which will have
to be withheld from a person affected - the judgment in <i>Rossminster</i> is
in my view very relevant background to a proper understanding of the scheme. As
in <i>Rossminster</i>, so under section 8, it must have been envisaged that the
warrant might be issued on the basis of information which could not in the
public interest be disclosed to persons affected - at least until some future
date after the investigation was over, or perhaps (as when it relates to an
informer) for ever. It is of course the case that the issue and execution of a
search and seizure warrant may, to a greater or lesser degree, involve
interference with someone’s real or personal property, possessory or other
interests. But there is no change in substantive property or possessory rights
and any invasion of privacy interests is limited and in the general public
interest; such interference as there is only occurs in the interests of the
investigation of serious (indictable) offending.</span></a></p><a name="para33">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is also relevant that the
statutory procedure under section 8 is subject to a number of protections,
expressed or inherent in the statutory language and in the current rules
summarised in para 25 above. It only applies when a magistrate is on reasonable
grounds satisfied by a constable that an indictable offence has been committed.
A constable, when seeking <i>ex parte</i> to satisfy the magistrate that the
requirements of section 8 are met, owes a duty of candour, meaning that the
information on which he or she relies must constitute a fair and balanced
presentation of the circumstances on the basis of which a warrant is sought:
compare for example <i>In re Stanford International Bank Ltd </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/137.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 137</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/137.html">[2011] Ch 33</a>, esp at paras 82-83 and 88, per Morritt C and para 191,
per Hughes LJ. A further point is that the material sought must “not consist of
or include items subject to legal privilege, excluded material or special
procedure material” (section 8(1)(d)). Excluded material refers, in summary, to
personal records which a person “has acquired or created in the course of any
trade, business, profession or other occupation or for the purpose of any paid
or unpaid office and which he holds in confidence”, as well as human tissue
taken in a medical context and held in confidence and journalistic material
held in confidence (section 11 of PACE). Special procedure material includes
other journalistic material (section 14(1)), as well as “material … in the
possession of <a name="_Hlk498805840">a person who … acquired or created it in
the course of any trade, business, profession or other occupation or for the
purpose of any paid or unpaid office”</a> (section 14(2)). Under Schedule 1 to
PACE, only a Crown Court judge can make an order relating to special procedure
material. There are two possibilities. One involves seeking a production order under
Schedule 1 paragraph 4; such an order can under paragraph 2 be obtained under
conditions which include conditions broadly mirroring those applicable under
section 8(1)(a) to (d) (Schedule 1 paragraphs 2 and 3); but Schedule 1 paragraph
7 provides that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An application for an order under
paragraph 4 above that relates to material that consists of or includes
journalistic material shall be made inter partes.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The other possibility is to seek a search and seizure
warrant, which may be sought<i> ex parte</i>, again under conditions mirroring
section 8(1)(a) to (d), provided that one of certain further conditions is
satisfied (Schedule 1, paragraphs 12(a)(ii) and 14), namely:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that it is not
practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant entry to the
premises …;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that it is practicable
to communicate with a person entitled to grant entry to the premises but it is
not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant access to the material;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [presently irrelevant];</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that service of notice
of an application for an order under paragraph 4 above may seriously prejudice
the investigation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court has determined that, on an <i>inter partes</i>
application for a production order in relation to journalistic material under Schedule
1 paragraph 4, a Crown Court judge is not entitled to conduct part of the
proceedings <i>ex parte </i>and to hear during that part, and to have regard in
his decision to, information withheld from the other party to the application: <i>R
(British Sky Broadcasting Ltd) v Central Criminal Court </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/17.html">[2014] UKSC 17</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/17.html">[2014] AC 885</a>. But, in the course of a judgment with which the whole Court
agreed, Lord Toulson contrasted the case before the Court there with the
general position when use is made <i>ex parte</i> of the court’s procedural
powers to obtain evidence. He said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a general proposition,
I would agree with the Commissioner’s argument that the court should not apply
the <i>Al Rawi</i> principle to an application made by a party to litigation
(or prospective litigation) to use the procedural powers of the court to obtain
evidence for the purposes of the litigation from somebody who is not a party or
intended party to the litigation. This is because such an application will not
ordinarily involve the court deciding any question of substantive legal rights
as between the applicant and the respondent. Rather it is an ancillary
procedure designed to facilitate the attempt of one or other party to see that
relevant evidence is made available to the court in determining the substantive
dispute. Applications of this kind, such as an application for a witness
summons in civil or criminal proceedings, are typically made ex parte.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the present
situation is different. Compulsory disclosure of journalistic material is a
highly sensitive and potentially difficult area. It is likely to involve
questions of the journalist’s substantive rights. Parliament has recognised
this by establishing the special, indeed unique procedure under section 9 and Schedule
1 for resolving such questions. </p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately the issue in
this appeal is a short one. It turns on the meaning and effect of paragraph 7
of Schedule 1. Parliament recognised the tension between the conflicting public
interests in requiring that an application for a production order shall be made
‘inter partes’. The Government had originally proposed that a production order
might be made ex parte, but that proposal met opposition and was dropped. When
an application for a production order is made, there is a lis between the
person making the application and the person against whom it is made, which may
later arise between the police and the suspected person through a criminal
charge. Equal treatment of the parties requires that each should know what
material the other is asking the court to take into account in making its
decision and should have a fair opportunity to respond to it. That is inherent
in the concept of an ‘inter partes’ hearing.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these paragraphs, Lord Toulson identified two categories of
situation. The first, addressed in para 28, was focused on use of the court’s
procedural powers, typically on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, to obtain evidence
for the purposes of the litigation “from somebody who is not a party or
intended party to the litigation”. The second, contrasted in paras 29 and 30,
concerned the <i>inter partes</i> procedure which applies under Schedule 1
paragraph 7 when journalistic material is sought. Lord Toulson noted that it
had been a deliberate decision by the Government to drop its original proposal
for an <i>ex parte </i>procedure, after this had met opposition. In the result
there was “a lis between the person making the application and the person against
whom it is made” ie typically the journalist, “which may later arise between
the police and the suspected person through a criminal charge”. An <i>ex parte</i>
application for a search warrant under section 8 of PACE falls naturally into
an extended conception of the former category, rather than into the second
category. There is no necessary proprietary or personal link between premises
sought to be searched or material sought to be seized by a warrant under
section 8 and any particular individual who may be being investigated. In the
present case, there was a factual link, in that the underlying investigation
related to, amongst others, the appellant. But the warrant was directed to the
premises and material on it, not to the appellant. The procedure did not create
any “lis” between the police or prosecution service and him, even if such a lis
might later arise. The search warrant was, in Lord Toulson’s terms, “an
ancillary procedure” designed to enable the police to fulfil their role of
investigating suspected criminality.</a></p><a name="para36">

</span>For all these reasons, and subject to review in the light of the answers
to subsequent issues, the answer to issue (i) is in my opinion that the
statutory scheme entitles a magistrates’ court, on an <i>ex parte</i>
application for a search and seizure warrant under sections 8 and 15(3) of
PACE, to rely on information which in the public interest cannot be disclosed
to the subject of the warrant.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>It is convenient to take issue (iii) before issue (ii). The question
under issue (iii) is in substance whether a Crown Court, on an application made
<i>inter partes</i> under section 59 of the CJPA to retain unlawfully seized
material, can operate a closed procedure to have regard to information which
for public interest reasons is not disclosable.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This issue involves consideration of the interplay between the <i>ex
parte </i>procedure for issue of a search and seizure warrant under section 8
and the <i>inter partes</i> procedure for authorising retention under section
59 of property seized but otherwise falling to be returned. Section 59(7)
provides that retention may be authorised on the grounds that:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(if the property were returned)
it would immediately become appropriate … to issue, on the application of the
person who is in possession of the property at the time of the application
under this section, a warrant in pursuance of which, or of the exercise of
which, it would be lawful to seize the property ...”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 59(7) accordingly requires the Crown Court, when deciding
whether to authorise retention, to put itself in the shoes of a hypothetical
magistrates’ court being asked, immediately after the return of the property,
to issue a fresh warrant with a view to seizure of the property. In the light
of the answer given to issue (i), such a magistrates’ court would have been
entitled on the hypothetical <i>ex parte </i>application made to it for such
seizure to have regard to information placed before it by the constable which
on public interest grounds could not be disclosed to others. The Crown Court
could not fulfil its role without having regard to such information. But if it
did so <i>inter partes</i> that would involve disclosing the information in a
way which the public interest would preclude (and which the hypothetical
magistrate would not do).</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>The statutory scheme of PACE and the CJPA must have been intended to be
coherent, and Parliament must be taken in these circumstances to have
contemplated that the Crown Court would, so far as necessary, be able to
operate a closed material procedure, to ensure that it could have regard to
material which would have been put before the hypothetical magistrates’ court
and withheld from disclosure there, without contravening the public interest by
disclosing such material on the section 59 application.</a></p><a name="para41">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In <i>Bank Mellat v HM Treasury
(No 2) </i>this court was faced with a situation where there was no express
provision for it to operate a closed material procedure on an appeal, although
such a procedure had been provided for and applied in the courts below. The
Supreme Court, by a majority, held a power to hold a closed material procedure
to be implicit in the statutory provisions. These gave it a power to hear
appeals against “any” order or judgment of the Court of Appeal (section 40(2)
of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 - “CRA”) and a power to “determine any
question necessary … for the purposes of doing justice in an appeal to it under
any enactment” (section 40(5) CRA). The Court also took into account that an
appeal to it against a wholly or partially closed judgment could not otherwise
be effective. The situation now before the Court presents an analogy. Section
59 postulates that the Crown Court will be able to put itself into the shoes of
a hypothetical magistrates’ court. This will not work, unless the Crown Court
can operate, so far as necessary, the same closed procedure as the magistrates’
court could and would have done.</span></a></p><a name="para42">

light of the conclusions already provisionally reached, the magistrate may
issue such a warrant and the Crown Court may make an order under section 59

affected. What is the position on a judicial review of the magistrate’s or

question is that judicial review must on any view be subject to the principle
in <i>Al Rawi</i>, that the court on judicial review cannot adopt a closed
procedure and, further, that this undermines the conclusions already expressed
in respect of issues (i) and (iii) above about the permissibility of a closed
procedure by a magistrate issuing a warrant or a Crown Court considering a
section 59 application. He also submits that, even if he is wrong on this last
point, the inability of the court on judicial review to conduct a closed
material procedure and to look at material withheld from the claimant must mean
that the warrant or section 59 order is set aside, if the material disclosed
does not itself justify the warrant or order. The commencement of judicial
review proceedings would, in that situation, ensure the setting aside of a
warrant or order which had itself been properly issued. In this connection, Mr
Summers relies on and maintains the correctness of the fourth pillar of Marcus
Smith J’s reasoning in <i>Concordia</i>, set out in para 24(iv) above.</span></a></p><a name="para45">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Chamberlain’s and Mr Eadie’s
answers are to the opposite effect. They submit that, whatever the position
regarding judicial review, there is no reason to disturb the scheme as it was
in their submission intended to operate before a magistrate and the Crown
Court. If the court on judicial review is required under <i>Al Rawi</i> to
forego any sort of closed material procedure, there will be no basis upon which
any person affected can complain that the issue of the warrant, or the making
of the section 59 order, was not justified by material before the magistrate or
Crown Court. However, their primary case in this situation is that, if the
magistrate or Crown Court can rely on material withheld from a person affected,
the court on a judicial review can and should fashion its procedures to be able
to do so also.</span></a></p><a name="para46">

</span>The <i>Rossminster </i>case is of relevance to these issues. In <i>Rossminster</i>,
the material which had been before the judge when he issued the warrant was not
before the courts on judicial review. The Divisional Court held that in these
circumstances there was “simply … not the evidence … to enable this court to
say that the judge exercised his discretion improperly”: p 961F. That
conclusion was upheld by the House: see per Lord Wilberforce, p 998F-G, Viscount
Dilhorne, p 1006H, applying the maxim <i>omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta</i>
and Lord Diplock, p 1013F-G, stating that:</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where Parliament has designated a
public officer as decision-maker for a particular class of decisions the High
Court, acting as a reviewing court under Order 53, is not a court of appeal. It
must proceed on the presumption <i>omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta</i> until that
presumption can be displaced by the applicant for review - upon whom the onus
lies of doing so. Since no reasons have been given by the decision-maker and no
unfavourable inference can be drawn for this fact because there is obvious
justification for his failure to do so, the presumption that he acted intra
vires can only be displaced by evidence of facts which cannot be reconciled
with there having been reasonable cause for his belief that the documents might
be required as evidence or alternatively which cannot be reconciled with his
having held such belief at all.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Lord Scarman also said that there was no reason to
suggest, nor was it possible to suggest, that the Common Serjeant had “failed
in his judicial duty” and it was therefore necessary to approach the case on
the basis that he did satisfy himself upon the relevant matters: pp 1022H-1023C-D.
All the members of the majority in the House emphasised the importance
attaching to the Common Serjeant’s fulfilment of this judicial duty, but their
decision meant that the prospects of a successful judicial review were much
reduced.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The approach taken in <i>Rossminster
</i>was therefore (i) to treat the onus as being on the applicant for judicial
review to establish that the warrant should be quashed and (ii) to treat the
applicant as unable to satisfy this onus, in circumstances where the original
decision-maker had access to material withheld on public interest grounds from
the person affected seeking judicial review; (iii) this result followed from
the application of the maxim <i>omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta</i>. The same
approach was followed and applied by the House in <i>R v Inland Revenue Comrs,
Ex p T C Coombs &amp; Co </i>[1991] 2 AC 283, in an application judicially to review
a notice served by an inspector of taxes under section 20 of the Taxes
Management Act 1970, requiring T C Coombs &amp; Co to deliver or make available
for inspection documents in their possession relevant to the tax liability of
the taxpayer, their former employee. The notice was given with the consent of a
commissioner, who, under section 20(7), was to give such consent only upon
being satisfied in all the circumstances that the inspector was justified in
proceeding under the section. The Revenue deposed that the information, which
had led it to believe that documents in T C Coombs’ possession might contain
information relevant to the taxpayer’s tax liability, could not be disclosed on
grounds of confidentiality, but had been fully laid before the commissioner. The
House, taking its guidance from Lord Diplock’s approach in <i>Rossminster</i>,
held that, as “Parliament designated the inspector as the decision-maker and … the
commissioner as the monitor of the decision … [a] presumption of regularity
applied to both” (p 302).</span></a></p><a name="para48">

The case involved the issue by a magistrate of a search and seizure warrant
under a statutory power in section 203 of the Customs Act, where any officer
had “reasonable cause to suspect that any uncustomed or prohibited goods, or
any books or documents relating [thereto] are harboured, kept or concealed in
any house or other place in the island”. The context was a customs
investigation into possible fraudulent importation of motor vehicles by the
applicants, a company and its majority shareholder. On the applicants’
constitutional challenge to the issue of the warrant, no evidence was put
before the court showing any such reasonable cause, on the basis that it would
have been contrary to the public interest to disclose such evidence to the
applicants at that time. Applying the approach in <i>Rossminster</i>, the Board
said that it “cannot be assumed against the Crown that they did not have
reasonable grounds for taking the documents which they did” (p 363F-G), and
that (p 365E-F):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although the courts may sometimes
feel frustrated by their inability to go behind the curtain of the recital that
the justice was duly satisfied and to examine the substance of whether
reasonable grounds for suspicion existed (a frustration articulated by Lord

1022) their Lordships think that it would be wrong to try to compensate by
creating formal requirements for the validity of a warrant which the statute
itself does not impose. In so doing, there is a risk of having the worst of
both worlds: the intention of the legislature to promote the investigation of
crime may be frustrated on technical and arbitrary grounds, while the courts,
in cases in which the outward formalities have been observed, remain incapable
of protecting the substance of the individual right conferred by the

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As noted already, and although
this is not their preferred solution, Mr Chamberlain and Mr Eadie invite the
Court, if necessary, to follow and apply the <i>Rossminster </i>line of authority
under section 8 of PACE. There are also two later decisions which could be said
to lend support to its continuing existence. First, in <i>Carnduff v Rock </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/680.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 680</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/680.html">[2001] 1 WLR 1786</a>, the Court of Appeal held that a claim by a
police informer for payment for information and assistance to the police was
un-triable because a fair trial of the issues would require the police to
disclose, and the court to investigate and adjudicate upon, sensitive
information which should in the public interest remain confidential to the
police. The public interest in withholding the evidence outweighed the countervailing
public interest in having the claim litigated. Although this conclusion was
reached on the basis that the case was un-triable, rather than on the basis of
any assumption as to the correctness of the police’s defence, the effect, that
the claim failed, was the same. Second, in <i>AHK v Secretary of State for the
Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/1117.html">[2012] EWHC 1117 (Admin)</a>, claims were made against the Home
Secretary for refusal to grant the applicants naturalisation on the grounds
that they were not of good character. The Home Secretary declined to give
further reasons or disclose documents on which she had relied, explaining that
to do so would be harmful to national security. Ouseley J held, on applications
for judicial review of the refusals, that it was not open to the court to hold
a closed material procedure, and that, if the Home Secretary gave evidence
that, having considered the applicants’ representations, there were good
reasons and a sound basis for her decision, which she could not disclose, it
would be impossible for the court to say that she was wrong on that, and the
claims would fail. There was no second possibility that the Home Secretary must
lose, or that the court should assume what it knew to be false, viz that no
relevant evidence was being withheld. This is an approach effectively identical
to that taken in the <i>Rossminster </i>line of authority. On the other hand,
in the still more recent judgment in <i>Concordia</i>, para 70, Marcus Smith J
considered that the exclusion from consideration by the court of material which
had properly been considered <i>ex parte</i> when the warrant was granted, but
which had on public interest grounds to be withheld on an <i>inter partes</i>
challenge, could well lead to a validly issued warrant being quashed. While the
CMA is recorded as having argued to the contrary by reference to the presumption
of regularity (para 43), and the Supreme Court is informed that its written
case referred to both <i>Rossminster</i> and <i>Ex p T C Coombs</i>, Marcus
Smith J’s judgment does not specifically address the <i>Rossminster </i>line of
authority.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para52"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The result reached in the <i>Rossminster
</i>line of authority is unattractive, in that it is in some circumstances
capable of depriving judicial review of any real teeth. For this reason, Mr
Chamberlain and Mr Eadie make their primary submission that the court on
judicial review of a warrant under section 8 of PACE or of an order under
section 59 of the CJPA can adopt a closed material procedure. Such a review
would mirror that which, as I have already provisionally concluded, is open to
the magistrate for a warrant under section 8 or for disclosure under <i>Bangs</i>
or to the Crown Court on an application under section 59 of the CJPA. That is
its attraction. Judicial review should be effective and able to address the
decision under review on the same basis that the decision was taken. The <i>Rossminster
</i>line of authority involves an awkward mismatch between the bases of the
original and reviewing decisions. So too does the reverse approach taken by
Marcus Smith J in <i>Concordia</i>.</span></a></p><a name="para52">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">However, in <i>Al Rawi </i>the
Supreme Court said that a closed material procedure is inadmissible, without
Parliamentary authorisation, in judicial review as it is in any ordinary civil
claim: see eg paras 39 and 62, per Lord Dyson. The two “narrowly defined”
exceptions which it recognised as existing related to: (i) cases where “the
whole object of the proceedings is to protect and promote the best interests of
a child [and] disclosure of some of the evidence would be so detrimental to the
child’s welfare as to defeat the whole object of the exercise” (para 63,
quoting Lady Hale in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB</i>
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/46.html">[2008] 1 AC 440</a>, para 58); and (ii) cases where the whole object of the
proceedings is to protect a commercial interest, and where full disclosure
would render the proceedings futile (cases in which a “confidentiality ring” is
commonplace) (para 64).</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para54"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The situation in which a court is
placed on a claim for judicial review in the present context can be compared
with that which the Supreme Court faced in <i>Bank Mellat</i>. In that case,
the courts below had express power to conduct a closed material procedure,
under Part 6 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”). The Supreme
Court had none. But the majority derived from the statutory language governing
appeals to it and a close consideration of the consequences of the various
alternative analyses a conclusion that the Supreme Court was also able to
conduct a closed material procedure (paras 37 to 44). The statutory language
governing appeals consisted of section 40(2) of the CRA, stating that “an
appeal lies to the court from any order or judgment of the Court of Appeal in
England and Wales in civil proceedings”, read with section 40(5), giving the
Supreme Court “power to determine any question necessary to be determined for
the purposes of doing justice in an appeal to it under any enactment”. If a
closed material procedure was not permissible, the alternative analyses were
that (a) the appeal could not be entertained (compare <i>Carnduff v Rock</i>)
or (b) the Supreme Court could consider the closed material in open court, or
(c) the Court could determine the appeal without looking at the closed material
(compare <i>Concordia</i>), or (d) the Court would be bound to allow the appeal
or (e) the Court would be bound to dismiss the appeal (compare <i>Rossminster</i>).
Lord Neuberger, speaking for the majority, said that analysis (a) ran contrary
to section 40(2), analysis (b) would wholly undermine Part 6 of the 2008 Act,
analysis (c) “would be self-evidently unsatisfactory and would seriously risk
injustice, and in some cases it would be absurd” and each of analyses (d) and
(e) was “self-evidently equally unsatisfactory”.</span></a></p><a name="para54">

possibilities to a closed material procedure identified by Lord Neuberger in <i>Bank
Mellat </i>exists by analogy in relation to judicial review (as Marcus Smith

be seen to be as unsatisfactory in relation to judicial review as in relation
to an appeal in <i>Bank Mellat</i>.</span></a></p><a name="para55">

an appeal, certainly not in terms or under conditions making it a precise

Council v Michalak</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/71.html">[2017] UKSC 71</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/71.html">[2017] 1 WLR 4193</a>. It is in origin a
development of the common law, to ensure regularity in executive and subordinate
legislative activity and so compliance with the rule of law, but it is
regulated now by the Senior Courts Act 1981. Section 31(1) of the 1981 Act
defines an application for judicial review as an application for a mandatory,
prohibiting or quashing order (or for a declaration or injunction in some
public law contexts), and section 31 also provides:</p>

</span>Although there are differences between judicial review and an appeal in
the normal sense of that word, many of the considerations which were of weight
in <i>Bank Mellat </i>on an appeal from lower courts conducting closed material
procedures are also of weight in relation to judicial review of lower courts
conducting such procedures. In <i>Bank Mellat</i>, a determination by the
Supreme Court on a basis different from that required and adopted in the courts
below would have been self-evidently unsatisfactory, risk injustice and in some
cases be absurd. So too in the present context it would be self-evidently
unsatisfactory, and productive potentially of injustice and absurdity, if the
High Court on judicial review were bound to address the matter on a different
basis from the magistrate or Crown Court, and, if it quashed the order, to
remit the matter for determination by the lower court on a basis different from
that which the lower court had quite rightly adopted and been required to adopt
when first considering the matter. Moreover, subsections (5) and (5A), read
together, only work on the basis that it is open to the High Court to consider
and, where appropriate, itself give effect to the decision which the lower
court or tribunal should have reached, if there is only one such decision which
it could have reached. If the High Court cannot by a closed material procedure
have regard to closed material, those subsections will not work.</a></p><a name="para57">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Since the events giving rise to
the present litigation, section 31 has also been amended by the introduction of
subsections (2A) and (3C) by section 84(1) and (2) of the Criminal Justice and
Courts Act 2015. Subsection (2A) provides that the High Court must refuse
relief on an application for judicial review “if it appears to the court to be
highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not have been
substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred” (unless
the court considers under subsection (2B) that it is appropriate to disregard
this requirement for reasons of exceptional public interest). Subsection (3C)
provides that, when considering whether to grant leave for judicial review, the
High Court “may of its own motion consider whether the outcome for the
applicant would have been substantially different if the conduct complained of
had not occurred”. These subsections again postulate that the High Court will
be considering the outcome on the same basis as the lower court or tribunal.</span></a></p><a name="para58">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the light of these statutory
provisions and of an analysis of the alternative possibilities paralleling that
undertaken in <i>Bank Mellat</i>, I consider that the only sensible conclusion
is that judicial review can and must accommodate a closed material procedure,
where that is the procedure which Parliament has authorised in the lower court
or tribunal whose decision is under review. The Supreme Court, when it referred
in passing to judicial review in <i>Al Rawi</i>, was not directing its
attention to this very special situation. If it had done so, it might also have
seen a similarity between this situation and the two exceptions which it did
identify, where inability to adopt a closed material procedure would render the
whole object of the proceedings futile and where the interests of third parties
(such as informers) are potentially engaged. Be that as it may be, I consider
that the scheme authorised by Parliament for use in the magistrates’ court and
Crown Court, combined with Parliament’s evident understanding and intention as
to the basis on which judicial review should operate, lead to a conclusion that
the High Court can conduct a closed material procedure on judicial review of a
magistrate’s order for a warrant under section 8 PACE or a magistrate’s order
for disclosure, or a Crown Court judge’s order under section 59 of the CJPA. I
add, for completeness, that, even before judicial review was regulated by
statutory underpinning, I would also have considered that parallel
considerations pointed strongly to a conclusion that the present situation
falls outside the scope of the principle in <i>Al Rawi</i> and that a closed
material procedure would have been permissible on a purely common law judicial
review.</span></a></p><a name="para59">

Office </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/35.html">[2011] UKSC 35</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/35.html">[2012] 1 AC 452</a>. The contrary has not been suggested
on the present appeal. The authorities also include dicta suggesting that in
some, rare cases no disclosure at all of the relevant closed information may be
required at common law (see <i>Gittins</i>, para 79, per Davis J). Is this the
case, or does article 6 of the Convention apply to require a person affected by
a search warrant or order under section 59 to know at least the gist of the
case made out to justify the relevant order?</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para61"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As a matter of principle, open
justice should prevail to the maximum extent possible. Any closed material
procedure “should only ever be contemplated or permitted by a court if
satisfied, after inspection and full consideration of the relevant material as
well as after hearing the submissions of the special advocate, that it is
essential in the particular case”: <i>Tariq v Home Office</i>, para 67; and
should, of course, be restricted as far as possible. Further, the nature of the
issue may require, as a minimum, disclosure of the “gist” of the closed
material, to enable the person from whom it is withheld to address the essence
of the case against him: <i>A v United Kingdom </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/301.html">(2009) 49 EHRR 29</a>, <i>Secretary
of State for the Home Department v AF (No 3)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/28.html">[2010] 2 AC 269</a> (a control
order case). This will be so, where the issue affects the liberty of the person
(<i>A v United Kingdom</i>, and <i>Sher v United Kingdom </i>(2015) 63 EHRR 24,
para 149) or has an equivalent effect, as a control order or freezing order can
do (<i>AF (No 3)</i>; <i>Tariq v Home Office</i>, paras 26-27; and see, in the
European Court of Justice, <i>Kadi v Commission of the European Communities </i>(Case
T-85/09) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2010/T8509.html">[2011] 1 CMLR 24</a>, paras 129-177).</p>

</span>On the other hand, it is established by decisions of both the European
Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court that there are circumstances where it
may in the public interest be legitimate to withhold even the gist of the
material relied on for a decision which a person affected wishes to challenge.
The relevant caselaw is analysed in <i>Tariq v Home Office</i>, paras 27-37.
This approach has been applied in the European Court of Human Rights to
material allegedly making a person a security risk unsuitable for permanent
employment which would entail him having access to a naval base (<i>Leander v
Sweden</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1987/4.html">(1987) 9 EHRR 433</a>), to security material allegedly making a person
unsuitable for employment with the central office of information (<i>Esbester v
United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/64.html">(1994) 18 EHRR CD72</a>), and to material explaining the meaning
of a statement by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal that “no determination had
been made in his favour” in relation to a complainant in respect of complaints
that his communications were being wrongly intercepted - a statement which
could mean either that there had been no interceptions or that any
interceptions taking place had been lawful (<i>Kennedy v United Kingdom</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/682.html">(2011) 52 EHRR 4</a>). The approach in these cases was applied domestically by the
Supreme<i> </i>Court in <i>Tariq v Home Office</i>. The complainant’s security
clearance was withdrawn and he was suspended from his work as a Home Office
immigration officer, after the arrest of close family members in the course of
a suspected terrorism investigation. A closed material procedure was held, with
a special advocate, under rule 54 of the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and
Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1861). The majority concluded
that there was no invariable rule that gisting must always occur. It depended
on balancing the nature and weight of the circumstances on each side: see in
particular para 25.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para63"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the cases mentioned in para 62,
the courts were well aware that the complaints made involved significant
personal interests. Employment and citizenship are undoubtedly important to
personal identity and well-being; and the withholding of information had a
continuing effect on the complainants’ substantive position. Nonetheless, the
circumstances did not give rise to a right to gisting, when important
countervailing interests of state security made it impossible to disclose the
information without undue prejudice. The circumstances were not regarded as
impacting the person affected to the same extent as loss of personal freedom, or
a control or freezing order.</span></a></p><a name="para63">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The issue of a warrant authorising
a search of premises and seizure of documents involves a short-term invasion of
property. Such a warrant is, as I have pointed out, not specifically directed
at, or necessarily even linked with, anyone occupying the premises or having
any proprietary or possessory interest in the documents. Save that the taking
of documents for so long as is required for the limited purposes of an
investigation necessarily affects possession, such a warrant does not affect
the substantive position of anyone who does occupy the premises or have any
proprietary, possessory or other interest in any documents found therein. All
it may do is provide information, and maybe direct evidence, of potential use
in a current investigation into an indictable offence which the magistrate or
Crown Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing has
been committed. If the investigation leads to criminal proceedings, any person
affected will enjoy all the normal safeguards. Subject to any PII ruling in the
conventional sense (in which case the material will not be disclosed or used at
trial), there will be full disclosure. All material evidence relied on to
establish guilt will be before the court openly, without any form of anonymity
attaching to the witness or any restriction on questioning which might lead to
a witness’s identification, unless under the strict statutory conditions of court-ordered
anonymity pursuant to Part 3 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 introduced
subsequent to the House of Lords decision in <i>R v Davis </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/36.html">[2008] AC 1128</a>.
Any complaint about the propriety of use of any material seized will be capable
of being raised and submitted to the court’s decision under section 78 PACE.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para65"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgment, it cannot be
axiomatic in this context that even the gist of the relevant information must
be supplied to any person (such as the occupier or some other person claiming
some proprietary, possessory or other interest in the documents) claiming to be
affected by, and wishing to object to, the warrant or the search and seizure. Every
case must of course be considered in the light of its particular circumstances.
But, as a general proposition, I answer issue (v) in the negative.</span></a></p><a name="para65">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Having addressed the individual
issues in turn, I have also stepped back to consider whether the discussion in
respect of the issues considered later (particularly (ii) and (iv))
necessitates or gives reason to revise the answers reached in respect of the
issues considered earlier. In my opinion it does not. On the contrary, the
answers which I reached in respect of each of the issues in turn appear to me
to lead to a scheme which is both coherent and workable, as well as
corresponding with Parliament’s presumed intentions.</span></a></p><a name="para66">
