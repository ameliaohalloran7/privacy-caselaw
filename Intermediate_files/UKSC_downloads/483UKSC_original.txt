</span>These appeals concern the impact of a cap on housing benefit (“HB”), in
cases of deemed under-occupation of social sector housing, on those with
disabilities and on women living in “sanctuary scheme” accommodation.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cap was imposed by Regulation B13 of the Housing Benefit Regulations
2006 (SI 2006/213) (“Reg B13”). Reg B13 was introduced with effect from 1 April
2013, by way of amendment of the 2006 Regulations by the Housing Benefit
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3040), as further amended by the Housing
Benefit (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/665). It was a politically
controversial matter, described as either a “bedroom tax” or “removal of the
spare room subsidy” according to political viewpoint. Its merits are not a
matter for the court, nor is there any challenge to the legality of the cap as
it applies in general. The issues before the court are narrower.</a></p><a name="para2">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeals are from two judgments of the Court of Appeal, differently
constituted, in judicial review proceedings. The claimants either have
disabilities, or live with dependent family members who have disabilities, or
live in what are known as “sanctuary scheme” homes (accommodation specially
adapted to provide protection for women at severe risk of domestic violence).
They are all tenants of registered social landlords and they all receive or
received HB. They challenge the validity of Reg B13, as it applies to them, on
equality grounds. More specifically, they contend that there has been a violation
of their rights under article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights
(“ECHR”), taken with article 8 and/or article 1 of the First Protocol (“A1P1”)
and in A’s case that there has been a breach by the Secretary of State of the
Public Sector Equality Duty (“PSED”) under the Equality Act 2010. They are
supported in their challenges by the Equality and Human Rights Commission
(“EHRC”), which was given permission to intervene.</a></p><a name="para3">

claims (including MA’s claim) were resolved. When the case reached the Court of
Appeal the claims remaining in issue were those of Jacqueline Carmichael,
Richard Rourke, Mervyn Drage, JD and James Daly. Their claims were rejected by
the Divisional Court (Laws LJ and Cranston J) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/2213.html">[2013] EWHC 2213 (QB)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/2213.html">[2013] PTSR 1521</a>, and the Court of Appeal (Lord Dyson MR, Longmore and Ryder LJJ)

brought separately by A and the Rutherford family. Their claims were dismissed
at first instance by different judges, but their appeals were heard together,
and both succeeded in the Court of Appeal (Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd CJ and
Tomlinson and Vos LJJ) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/29.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 29</a>. A, who is in a sanctuary scheme, succeeded
under article 14 on the ground of sex discrimination, but failed in her claim

ground of disability discrimination. The Secretary of State is the respondent
in the MA case and is the appellant in relation to A and the Rutherfords. (In
the case of A, there is a cross appeal against the rejection of her Equality

</span>HB is a means tested benefit provided under section 130 of the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and subordinate regulations. (It
is due to be replaced eventually by Universal Credit, which is in the process
of being rolled out across parts of the United Kingdom.) Its purpose is to help
claimants with their rental costs. There is a prescribed mechanism for
determining in each case the appropriate maximum housing benefit (“AMHB”).
Section 130A of the 1992 Act, as inserted by section 30(2) of the Welfare
Reform Act 2007 and amended by section 69(3) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012,
allows regulations to provide for the amount of the claimant’s rental liability
to be taken into account in calculating the AMHB to be less than the actual
liability.</a></p><a name="para5">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The AMHB is calculated by reference to the “eligible rent”. Reg B13
provides for adjustment of the eligible rent and AMHB in the area of social
sector housing. The relevant parts are as follows:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)  The maximum rent (social

claimant is entitled; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)  25% where the number of
bedrooms in the dwelling exceeds by two or more the number of bedrooms to which
the claimant is entitled.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(4)  Where it appears to the
relevant authority that in the particular circumstances of any case the limited
rent is greater than it is reasonable to meet by way of housing benefit, the
maximum rent (social sector) shall be such lesser sum as appears to that
authority to be an appropriate rent in that particular case.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(5)  The claimant is entitled

Payments (“DHPs”) to be made to persons who are entitled to HB and/or council
tax benefit: Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, section 69.
As the title indicates, such payments are discretionary. The scheme is funded
by central government and administered by local authorities. By the terms of
the Discretionary Financial Assistance Regulations (SI 2001/1167), made under
section 69 of the 2000 Act, an award may be made for such period as the
authority considers appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case,
and the authority is required to give reasons for its decision. There is no
statutory right of appeal, but such decisions are in principle subject to
judicial review. The practice is for the Department of Work and Pensions to
make an annual DHP grant to local authorities in respect of their anticipated
expenditure.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>The evolution of Reg B13 is described in detail in the judgments given

Court of Appeal (paras 15 to 36). Paragraphs 20 to 33 of the judgment of Laws
LJ in the Divisional Court are reproduced at appendix 2 to this judgment. In
summary, as part of its policy for curbing public expenditure the government
aimed to ensure that social sector tenants of working age who were occupying
premises with more bedrooms than they required should, wherever possible, move
into smaller accommodation. It was recognised at an early stage that a policy
based purely on numbers of rooms and occupants would cause problems for some
with disabilities, and there was a debate within government and Parliament
about how such problems should be addressed. The government initially decided
that, rather than creating general exceptions for persons with disabilities (or
certain categories of persons with disabilities), their needs should be met as
necessary through a scheme of discretionary housing payments based on
individual assessments.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>Regulation B13 as first introduced by SI 2012/3040 did not include para
6 (“The claimant is entitled to one additional bedroom in any case where - (a)
the claimant or the claimant’s partner is (or each of them is) a person who

</span>The EHRC correctly pointed out in its written case, para 8, that there
has been a change in the structure of the under-occupation criteria now
contained in Reg B13. When under-occupation criteria were first introduced, the
provision for determining the number of bedrooms required by a household
depended entirely on the number of occupants, their ages and sexes, and whether
any of them were a couple. Para 6 contains provision for some
disability-related need. The result is a composite provision, structured on the
basis of a non-disabled “norm” but with provision for certain classes of
disability-related need.</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Parts of Reg B13 in its current form owe their origin to the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <i>Burnip v Birmingham City Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 629</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>. This arose from a provision in Reg 13D(3) of the Housing
Benefit Regulations 2006 (introduced by regulation 7 of the Housing Benefit
(Local Housing Allowance and Information Sharing) Amendment Regulations 2007
(SI 2007/2868) and amended by regulation 2(6) of the Housing Benefit
(Amendment) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2835) which came into force on 1 April
2011), in similar terms to Reg B13(5). The court heard appeals in three cases.
In <i>Burnip</i> and a second case the claimants were adults with disabilities
who required the presence of a carer throughout the night. By the time that the
matter reached the Court of Appeal, there had been a legislative amendment
which met those cases (by allowing an additional bedroom where the claimant or
claimant’s partner required overnight care). The third case, <i>Gorry v
Wiltshire County Council</i>, concerned a family including two children of the
same sex who suffered from severe disabilities which made it inappropriate for
them to share a bedroom.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court held that in each case there had been discrimination under
article 14, because Reg B13 had a disparate adverse impact on persons with
disabilities, and that the discrimination had not been justified. The court recognised
that DHPs had a valuable role to play but it did not consider that they
provided an adequate response to the problem in the types of case with which
the court was concerned. The reasons for the court’s decision that the
discrimination was not justified were given by Henderson J, with whom Maurice
Kay LJ (para 23) and Hooper LJ (para 25) agreed. Henderson J emphasised (para
64) that he was not suggesting a general exception from the normal bedroom test
for disabled people of all kinds. The exception, he said, was sought only for a
very limited category of claimants, namely those whose disability was so severe
that an extra bedroom was needed for a carer to sleep in, or in cases like that
of Mr Gorry where separate bedrooms were needed for children who, in the
absence of disability, could reasonably be expected to share a room. He
observed that such cases were by their nature likely to be relatively few in
number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse and unlikely to undergo change or
need regular monitoring. He added that the fact that Parliament had now
legislated for cases like that of Mr Burnip could be viewed as recognition by
Parliament of the justice of such claims. Ten months later, Reg B13 was amended
to insert para (5)(ba), which covered Mr Gorry’s case.</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>In the MA proceedings the Court of Appeal accepted that Reg B13 had a
discriminatory effect on some people with disabilities, but it held that the
discrimination was justified, primarily because the Secretary of State was entitled
to take the view that it was not practicable to exempt an imprecise class of
persons to whom the bedroom criteria would not apply because they needed extra
bedroom space by reason of disability. The DHP scheme had the benefit of
flexibility and was also appropriate because the nature of a person’s
disability and disability-related needs may change over time.</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>The court rejected the argument that the case of Mrs Carmichael, who
needed to sleep in a separate room from her husband on account of her
disability, was materially indistinguishable from the <i>Gorry </i>situation of
children who were unable to sleep in the same room, which had now been catered
for by the new provision contained in Reg B13(5)(ba). The court held that the
Secretary of State was entitled to provide greater protection for a child than
an adult because the best interests of a child are a primary consideration,
citing <i>R (JS) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Child Poverty
Action Group intervening)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/3350.html">[2013] EWHC 3350</a>, paras 42 to 46 (Elias LJ).</p>

</span>The court also rejected the allegation of a breach of the PSED. It
emphasised (para 83) that “the principal question in relation to the PSED is
not whether the decision (or “outcome”) is justifiable, but whether, in the
process leading to the making of the decision, the decision-maker had “due
regard” to the relevant considerations”, citing the review of the case law by
McCombe LJ in <i>R (Bracking) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1345.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1345</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1345.html">[2014] EqLR 60</a>, para 26.

</span>In the proceedings relating to A and the Rutherford family, the Court of
Appeal held that the situation of the Rutherford family, who included a child
with disabilities requiring an overnight carer on certain days of the week, was
indistinguishable from that of an adult with disabilities requiring an
overnight carer, to which the decision in <i>Burnip </i>and Reg B13(6) applied.
As explained at para 7, a child who requires overnight care does not come
within the statutory definition of a person who requires overnight care.</a></p><a name="para25">

</span>The court held that the reasoning in <i>Burnip</i> applied also in the
case of A, a female victim of domestic violence living in accommodation adapted
under a sanctuary scheme, because the category of persons in such schemes was
limited to a relatively small number of victims (albeit growing), who were easy
to identify, not liable to abuse the scheme, unlikely to undergo change and not
in need of regular monitoring.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court therefore held that there had been a breach of article 14 in
both cases. As to the PSED, the court held that the Secretary of State had
properly considered the questions of disability based discrimination and
gender-based discrimination.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span>The primary contention of the claimants in <i>MA</i> is that the
Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal applied the wrong test in asking
themselves whether the discriminatory treatment about which the claimants
complained was manifestly without reasonable foundation. In a case involving
disability discrimination, weighty reasons for justification were required. It
was wrong, they submitted, to see the case as one involving a matter of general
economic or social policy, to which the manifestly without reasonable
foundation test was appropriate. No objection was being raised to the general
policy of Reg B13. The objection was to the application of the policy in a way
which unjustifiably discriminated against a group of people with disabilities.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal based their approach on the
judgment of Lady Hale, with which the other members of the court agreed, in <i>Humphreys
v Revenue and Customs Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/18.html">[2012] 1 WLR 1545</a>. It is necessary to set out
the relevant passage at some length:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“15.  The proper approach to
justification in cases involving discrimination in state benefits is to be
found in the Grand Chamber’s decision in <i>Stec</i><i> v United Kingdom </i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/393.html">43 EHRR 47</a>. The benefits in question were additional benefits for people who
had to stop work because of injury at work or occupational disease. They were
entitled to an earnings related benefit known as reduced earnings allowance.
But on reaching the state pension age, they either continued to receive reduced
earnings allowance at a frozen rate or received instead a retirement allowance
which reflected their reduced pension entitlement rather than reduced earnings.
Women suffered this reduction in benefits earlier than men because they reached
state pension age at 60 whereas men reached it at 65.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">16.  The court repeated the
well-known general principle that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘A difference of treatment is,
however, discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in
other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a
reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the
aim sought to be realised.’ (para 51)</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">However, it explained the margin
of appreciation enjoyed by the contracting states in this context, at para 52:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘The scope of this margin will
vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background. As
a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the
court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of
sex as compatible with the Convention. On the other hand, a wide margin is
usually allowed to the state under the Convention when it comes to general
measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of
their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better
placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public
interest on social or economic grounds, and the court will generally respect
the legislature’s policy choice unless it is ‘manifestly without reasonable
foundation’.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">17.  The phrase ‘manifestly
without reasonable foundation’ dates back to <i>James v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 123</a>, para 46, which concerned the compatibility of leasehold
enfranchisement with article 1 of the First Protocol. In the <i>Stec </i>case
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/393.html">43 EHRR 47</a>, the court clearly applied this test to the state’s decisions as
to when and how to correct the inequality in the state pension ages, which had
originally been introduced to correct the disadvantaged position of women. ‘Similarly,
the decision to link eligibility for reduced earnings allowance to the pension
system was reasonably and objectively justified, given that this benefit is
intended to compensate for reduced earning capacity during a person’s working
life’: para 66. The Grand Chamber applied the <i>Stec </i>test again to social
security benefits in <i>Carson v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/338.html">51 EHRR 13</a>, para
61, albeit in the context of discrimination on grounds of country of residence
and age rather than sex.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">18.  The same test was
applied by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury (with whom Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord
Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry agreed) in R <i>(RJM) v
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/63.html">[2009] AC 311</a>, which concerned the
denial of income support disability premium to rough sleepers. Having quoted
para 52 of the <i>Stec </i>case <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/393.html">43 EHRR 47</a> he observed, at para 56, that this
was ‘an area where the court should be very slow to substitute its view for
that of the executive, especially as the discrimination is not on one of the
express, or primary grounds’. He went on to say that it was not possible to
characterise the views taken by the executive as ‘unreasonable’”. He concluded,
at para 57:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘The fact that there are grounds
for criticising, or disagreeing with, these views does not mean that they must
be rejected. Equally, the fact that the line may have been drawn imperfectly
does not mean that the policy cannot be justified. Of course, there will come a
point where the justification for a policy is so weak, or the line has been
drawn in such an arbitrary position, that, even with the broad margin of
appreciation accorded to the state, the court will conclude that the policy is
unjustifiable.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">19.  Their Lordships all
stressed that this was not a case of discrimination on one of the core or
listed grounds and that this might make a difference. In <i>R (Carson) v
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/37.html">[2006] 1 AC 173</a>, both Lord
Hoffmann and Lord Walker drew a distinction between discrimination on grounds
such as race and sex (sometimes referred to as ‘suspect’) and discrimination on
grounds such as place of residence and age, with which that case was concerned.
But that was before the Grand Chamber’s decision in the <i>Stec </i>case <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/393.html">43 EHRR 47</a>. It seems clear from <i>Stec, </i>however, that the normally strict
test for justification of sex discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention
rights gives way to the ‘manifestly without reasonable foundation’ test in the
context of state benefits. The same principles were applied to the sex
discrimination involved in denying widow’s pensions to men in <i>Runkee v
United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/373.html">[2007] 2 FCR 178</a>, para 36. If they apply to the direct sex
discrimination involved in the <i>Stec </i>and <i>Runkee </i>cases, they must,
as the Court of Appeal observed, at para 50, apply a fortiori to the indirect
sex discrimination with which we are concerned.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lady Hale added (para 22) that the fact the test is less stringent than
the “weighty reasons” normally required to justify sex discrimination did not
mean that the justifications put forward should escape “careful scrutiny”. On
analysis the discrimination may be found to lack a reasonable basis. What Lady
Hale said in the context of sex discrimination applies equally to disability
discrimination, as Lord Dyson MR rightly held in the present case (para 59).
Lord Dyson also emphasised that the fact that the court should apply the
manifestly without reasonable foundation test, and should exercise considerable
caution before interfering with the scheme approved by Parliament, did not
lessen the need for careful scrutiny of the reasons advanced by the Secretary
of State in justification of the scheme (para 60).</a></p><a name="para30">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case counsel for the claimants pointed out that in <i>Humphreys</i>
the unsuccessful appellant did not argue for anything other than the test
established in the <i>Stec </i>and <i>RJM</i> cases (para 20). It is therefore
necessary to ask whether there is good reason to depart from what Lady Hale
said in that case.</a></p><a name="para31">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental reason for applying the manifestly without reasonable
foundation test in cases about inequality in welfare systems was given by the
Grand Chamber in <i>Stec</i> (para 52). Choices about welfare systems involve
policy decisions on economic and social matters which are pre-eminently matters
for national authorities.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimants seek to counter that point by arguing that this case
involves no challenge to a decision of that kind. They have no quarrel with the
policy of Reg B13. Their complaint is at a lower level and involves no question
of economic or social judgment. Their complaint is simply that the manner of
implementation of the policy discriminates against a vulnerable group, and that
it is right to require weighty reasons to justify the discrimination rather
than the broader policy itself.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rejecting that argument, Lord Dyson MR said (paras 54 to 55) that
although the precise detail and scope of the Regulations may not be matters of
high policy in themselves, they formed an integral part of a high policy
decision and could not be dismissed as technical detail; that the law in this
area would suffer from undesirable uncertainty if the test were to vary
according to whether the challenge were to high level policy or lower level
policy; and that there was no hint of such a distinction in the European or
domestic case law.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was argued before this court that the rationale for the approach in <i>Humphreys</i>
does not apply in the present case. In <i>Humphreys</i> the challenge was to a
rule of the Child Tax Credit Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2007) that there should
be a single payment of child tax credit (“CTC”) for any child, and that it
should be made to the parent with the main responsibility for the child. The
revenue accepted that the scheme was indirectly discriminatory against men, but
the court found that there was objective justification. The purpose of CTC was
to help with meeting the needs of the household with primary responsibility for
the child’s care. A choice had to be made whether, and if so how, the CTC
should be split where parents had separated. The fact that men were less likely
to receive CTC than women was not related to their gender in such a way as to
show a lack of equal respect. It reflected the fact that men were more likely
to be non-resident parents, and therefore less likely to need the CTC. The
decision that there should be a single payment of CTC in respect of any child
was a necessary part of achieving the government’s economic and social policy.
By contrast, it was said that Reg B13 bears unequally on those with
disabilities because of their need in many cases for larger accommodation and
it is not necessary for it to do so.</a></p><a name="para35">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I will come on to consider the group of people who have a particular
medical need for an additional bedroom, but the argument which I am presently
considering goes too far. The claimants’ objections to Reg B13 relate to their
social as well as medical needs. The broad question which faced the Secretary
of State in relation to Reg B13 and its potential impact on those with
disabilities was whether to try to deal comprehensively with all problems of
those who have any kind of disability (including social needs not dissimilar to
those of other groups) within the precise rules of the regulation, or whether
to accommodate them by a linked system of discretionary benefits. This is in my
view a clear example of a question of economic and social policy, integral to
the structure of the welfare benefit scheme, and it would not be appropriate to
depart from the court’s normal approach. Otherwise, it would be too easy for a
skilled lawyer to circumvent the general rule by couching the discrimination
complaint in terms of an attack on matters of detail.</a></p><a name="para36">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I accept that examples can be found of state benefit cases where
European courts have spoken of a need for weighty reasons to justify
discrimination. The decision of the Grand Chamber in <i>Andrejeva v Latvia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/297.html">51 EHRR 28</a> is one such example. Latvian state pension rules discriminated
against the applicant on grounds of her nationality. The Strasbourg court said
that while a wide margin of appreciation is usually allowed to the state under
the Convention when it comes to measures of economic or social strategy, in a
case where nationality was the sole criterion for differential treatment very
weighty reasons would have to be put forward to justify it. In that case there
was, on the face of it, no reasonable foundation for such discrimination, and
in those circumstances it was for the state to produce a good reason to justify
it. In the language of Lady Hale in <i>Humphreys</i>, on careful scrutiny the
discrimination had no reasonable justification. Other examples cited in
argument included <i>Zeman v Austria</i> (Application No 23960/02, 29 June 2006,  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/677.html">[2006] ECHR 677</a>);
<i>Luczak v Poland</i> (Application No 77782/01, 27 November 2007,  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/986.html">[2007] ECHR 986</a>), <i>Markin v

October 2015,  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2015/878.html">[2015] ECHR 878</a>). None of them contain a statement of general principle
inconsistent with <i>Humphreys</i>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would affirm what was said in <i>Humphreys</i> in the passage cited

</span>As a fall back to their argument that the wrong test has been applied,
the claimants in MA contend that the courts below failed to give the Reg B13
scheme sufficiently careful scrutiny and that, as a matter of principle, the
availability of DHPs could not justify a reduction in the HB to which persons
suffering from disabilities would be entitled but for Reg B13.</a></p><a name="para39">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The impact of Reg B13 on those with disabilities was considered by the
government and Parliament in depth. This is apparent from Laws LJ’s resume of
the evolution of the policy (appendix 2). The reasons for the decision not to
apply a general exemption from Reg B13 for those suffering from disabilities,
but instead to make good the shortfall in cases where it would be inappropriate
to expect someone with a disability to move house (or make good the shortfall
by other means such as taking a lodger), were also explained in witness
statements by Beverley Walsh, a senior civil servant in the Department of Work
and Pensions. The essential point she made was that the impact of Reg B13 on
those with disabilities was not uniform, but depended to a large degree on the
nature and extent of their disabilities, as well as on their personal and
social circumstances (such as whether they relied heavily on a local support
network and whether suitable alternative accommodation was available, particularly
if their present accommodation had been adapted to meet their individual
needs). Some with disabilities would be significantly affected by the cap based
on bedroom criteria; others would be no more affected than someone without
disability.</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>In <i>MA</i> the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal concluded
after careful scrutiny that the Secretary of State’s decision to structure the
scheme as he did was reasonable. In general terms I agree. There was certainly
a reasonable foundation for the Secretary of State’s decision not to create a
blanket exception for anyone suffering from a disability within the meaning of
the Equality Act (which covers anyone who has a physical or mental impairment
that has a more than minimal long term effect on the ability to do normal daily
activities) and to regard a DHP scheme as more appropriate than an exhaustive
set of bright line rules to cover every contingency.</a></p><a name="para41">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, that is not the end of the matter, for there are some people
who suffer from disabilities such that they have a transparent medical need for
an additional bedroom. <i>Burnip</i> and <i>Gorry</i> were in that category.
Even before the decision in those cases there had been an amendment of the
Regulations to “… include one additional bedroom in any case where the claimant
or the claimant’s partner is a person who requires overnight care (or in any
case where both of them are)”. <i>Burnip</i> was such a case. <i>Gorry</i> was
a case where children required separate bedrooms for disability reasons. In
those cases, which were rightly identified by the Court of Appeal as ones where
the individuals’ medical condition was easy to recognise and gave rise to the
need for a separate bedroom, there was no reasonable cause to apply the same
cap on HB as if the bedrooms were truly under-occupied. (Henderson J said that
such cases were likely to be few, but I do not see that as a significant factor
in itself.)</a></p><a name="para42">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That brings me to the cases of Jacqueline Carmichael and the Rutherford
family. They are counterparts to <i>Gorry</i> and <i>Burnip</i> respectively.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mrs Carmichael cannot share a bedroom with her husband because of her
disabilities. Her position is directly comparable to that of the Gorry
children, who could not share a bedroom because of their disabilities. But Mrs
Carmichael is caught by Reg B13 because para (5)(ba), which was introduced to
meet the <i>Gorry</i> situation is confined to “a child who cannot share a
bedroom”.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rutherfords need a regular overnight carer for their grandson who
has severe disabilities. Their position is comparable to that of Mr Burnip, who
needed an overnight carer. But the Rutherfords are caught by Reg B13 because
para (6)(a), which covers the <i>Burnip</i> situation, does not extend to a
child who requires overnight care.</a></p><a name="para45">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no reasonable justification for these differences. The Court of
Appeal in <i>MA</i> was persuaded (para 79) that there was an objective
reasonable justification for treating Mrs Carmichael less favourably than a
child in like circumstances, because the best interests of children are a
primary consideration. I can see that there may be some respects in which
differential treatment of children and adults regarding the occupation of
bedrooms may have a sensible explanation. Expecting children to share a bedroom
is not the same as expecting adults to do so. But I cannot, with respect, see a
sensible reason for distinguishing between adult partners who cannot share a
bedroom because of disability and children who cannot do so because of
disability. And the same applies also to distinguishing between adults and
children in need of an overnight carer.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is also an ironic and inexplicable inconsistency in the Secretary
of State’s approach in the Carmichael and Rutherford cases which Lord Thomas CJ
exposed in the latter at para 73:</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“He [the Secretary of State]
justified the distinction between making provision for a bedroom for disabled
children but not for disabled adults by reference to the best interests of the
child and explained the different treatment on that basis. On that basis, it
seems to us very difficult to justify the treatment within the same regulation
of carers for disabled children and disabled adults, where precisely the
opposite result is achieved; provision for the carers of disabled adults but
not for the carers of disabled children.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Thomas CJ added that the court accepted that DHPs were intended to
provide the same sum of money, but it was not persuaded that this justified the
different treatment of children and adults in respect of the same essential
need within the same regulation. I agree.</a></p><a name="para48">

</span>I would therefore dismiss the Secretary of State’s appeal in the
Rutherford case, but I would allow Mrs Carmichael’s appeal and would hold that
in her case there has been a violation of article 14, taken with article 8. (In

Rian, stays with him regularly, but he is not within the list of those who
qualify for a bedroom under Reg B13(5) because he spends less than half his
time with his father. This has nothing to do with the fact of his disability.
Mr Daly may have a powerful case for a DHP award, so that he can continue to
pay his rent from state benefits for Rian’s sake, but I accept the Secretary of
State’s argument that he has no proper basis for challenging the HB and DHP
structure on equality grounds.</a></p><a name="para51">

</span>Mr Drage is the sole occupier of a three-bedroom flat, which is full of
accumulated papers. He suffers from an obsessive compulsive disorder. His
hoarding of papers is no doubt connected to his mental illness, but that is
very far from showing that he has a need for three bedrooms. It is not

One of the bedrooms is used for the storage of equipment. It is another example

</span>A and her son live in a three-bedroom house. A has said in a witness
statement that when she moved there she only needed a two-bedroom property, but
that there was a shortage of two-bedroom properties and she accepted the offer
of a three-bedroom property. This was prior to the events giving rise to her
need for protection under the sanctuary scheme, which led to its adaptation to
provide a high level of security, but the adaptations did not involve using the
third bedroom. There is no objective need for her to have three bedrooms, one
of which is unoccupied, but she is understandably loath to move (even if
suitable alternative accommodation could be found and made appropriately
secure), because she has lived in her present property for many years, she
knows her neighbours well and she feels safe where she is. Those are powerful
reasons, but they have nothing to do with the number of bedrooms. Many other
people may have very strong reasons for continuing to live in a larger property
than they currently need in terms of size.</a></p><a name="para56">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal said in A’s case that while it had great sympathy
with the Secretary of State’s arguments for saying that it fell into the broad
class for which DHPs were appropriate, <i>Burnip</i> obliged the court to hold
otherwise (paras 54 to 55). Like <i>Burnip</i>, A fell into an easily
recognisable class few in number.</a></p><a name="para57">

</span>I have already said that I do not see the likely number of people
affected as a critical factor in itself (para 42). To favour those in a small
group with strong societal reasons for staying in a bigger property than they
need over those in a larger group with equally strong or possibly stronger reasons
would be truly irrational. The distinction between <i>Burnip</i> and A is that
in <i>Burnip</i> there was a transparent medical need for an additional
bedroom, whereas A has no need for a three-bedroom property. A’s case for
staying where she is, strong as that case would appear to be, has nothing to do
with the size of the property; Mr Burnip’s case had everything to do with the
size of the property and its ability to accommodate a carer.</a></p><a name="para58">

</span>Notwithstanding my considerable sympathy for A and other women in her
predicament, I would allow the Secretary of State’s appeal in A’s case. I add
that for as long as A, and others in a similar situation, are in need of the
protection of sanctuary scheme housing, they must of course receive it; but
that does not require the court to hold that A has a valid claim against the
Secretary of State for unlawful sex discrimination.</a></p><a name="para59">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lady Hale has reached a different conclusion. She considers that Reg 13B
operates so as to discriminate against women such as A who are victims of
gender-based violence, in breach of their rights under article 14 taken with
article 8 of the ECHR. Lady Hale’s starting point is that while A has no need
for more bedroom space than is allowed for under Reg B13(5), she has a
different type of need, that is, a need to stay where she is because it has
been adapted as part of a scheme to provide her with a safe haven. Lady Hale
says that her case cannot be equated with other people who may have a
compelling case for staying where they are, because even if such people have a
status for the purpose of article 14, their cases would need individual
evaluation (para 78). I agree that not everybody who could make out a strong
case for remaining where they are could necessarily be fitted into a relevant
“status”. An everyday example would be a person who lives close to and is the
primary carer for an elderly parent, who is dependent on that person for being
able to continue to live in the elderly parent’s own home. Whether the parent
would be able to bring himself or herself within articles 8 and 14 in such
circumstances would be debatable. But the carer may be able to show a powerful
case that there is a need for her to live where she does, even if she happens
to have a spare bedroom; and that, leaving aside humanitarian considerations,
the cost of state care for the parent would be likely far to exceed any saving
by reducing the carer’s HB. I agree also with Lady Hale about the need for
individual evaluation, and it was this consideration which primarily led the
Secretary of State to decide that cases of need for reasons unconnected with
the size of the property should be dealt with through the DHP scheme.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Take also the case of JD and AD (referred to in para 53). Just as in A’s
case, their property has been specially adapted to provide AD with an
environment where she can live in safety. Lady Hale’s observation (in para 76)
that because of its special character, it will be difficult (if not impossible)
for her to move elsewhere and would certainly put the State to further expense
may equally be said of AD, but the court is unanimous that it is not
unreasonable for JD and AD’s need for housing benefit to be considered under
the DHP scheme, notwithstanding the differences between HB and DHP to which Lady
Hale has referred in para 77 AD’s disabilities are at the severe end of the
spectrum, but there can be degrees of disability, and the alterations to a
property to accommodate the person’s needs may be on a larger or smaller scale.
These are matters which the Secretary of State may legitimately say require
individual evaluation.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Such examples could be multiplied, but the point remains the same. It
was recognised from the time that Reg B13 was mooted that there will be some
people who have a very powerful case for remaining where they are, on grounds
of need unrelated to the size of the property. For reasons explained in the
evidence (to which I have referred in para 40), it was decided not to try to
deal with cases of personal need unrelated to the size of the property by
general exemptions for particular categories but to take account of them
through DHPs.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lady Hale has observed that it has not been demonstrated that there
would be insuperable practical difficulties in drafting an exemption from Reg
B13 for victims of gender-based violence who are in a sanctuary scheme and who
need for that reason to stay where they are. In her witness statement on behalf
of the Secretary of State in A’s case, Ms Walsh drew an analogy between
adaptations made to properties for persons with disabilities and adaptations
made under sanctuary schemes. She made the point that the type of adaptations
made and their cost is likely to vary from case to case, and by implication that
they may be more easy or less easy to replicate. These factors would be
relevant in considering the strength of the case for saying that the person
concerned needs to stay where they are. A herself has emphasised that she
regards the support of neighbours and family as critical, and that may well be
so. But that is a personal factor which may not necessarily apply, or apply to
the same degree, to other victims of domestic violence. It is also a factor
which may apply as strongly to the elderly or persons with disabilities.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So while I agree that there would have been no insuperable practical difficulty
in drafting an exemption from the size criteria for victims of gender violence
who are in a sanctuary scheme and who need for that reason to stay where they are,
deciding whether they really needed to stay in that particular property would
at least in some cases require some form of evaluation. I leave aside the
question debated in the evidence about whether some people in a sanctuary
scheme might safely be able to make use of a spare room by taking in someone
else such as a family member. Likewise I do not suppose that there would be
insuperable practical difficulties in drafting exemptions to meet other
categories of people who may justifiably claim to have a need to remain where
they are for reasons unconnected with the size of the accommodation, but this
would again require an evaluative process.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lady Hale considers that there is a further point of distinction between
A’s case and AD’s case in that the state has a positive duty to provide
effective protection to victims of gender-based violence. I do not think it
necessary for present purposes to go into a comparative analysis of the duty of
the state to A and AD, because I do not see that the duty to victims of gender-based
violence mandates the means by which such protection is provided. A has not
established that the adoption of Reg B13 has deprived her, or is likely to
deprive her, of a safe haven.</a></p><a name="para65">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ultimately, whether the Secretary of State could practicably have
adopted a different approach is surely not the test. I have understood the
court to be unanimous that the test is that laid down in <i>Humphreys</i>, to
which I have referred. Applying that test, and recognising the need for careful
scrutiny, I do not consider that the approach taken by the Secretary of State
was manifestly without reasonable foundation.</a></p><a name="para66">

</span>In relation to those with disabilities, the Divisional Court and the
Court of Appeal in the MA case reached the concurrent conclusion on the
evidence that the Secretary of State had fulfilled the duty. Lord Dyson MR, at
para 91, accepted that it was not sufficient for a decision-maker to have a
vague awareness of his legal duties. Rather, he must have a focused awareness
of the duties under section 149 of the Equality Act and, in a disability case,
their potential impact on people with disabilities. On the history of events
(see appendix 1) and the evidence, especially of Beverley Walsh, the courts
were well entitled to reach the conclusion that they did.</a></p><a name="para68">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to sex discrimination, in June 2012 the Department of Work
and Pensions published an updated Equality Impact Assessment which considered
the impact on those likely to be affected and their distribution, including by
gender. It did not address the group of those within sanctuary schemes. The
Court of Appeal concluded in A’s case at para 59:</a></p><a name="para69">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is clear that the Secretary of
State did address the question of gender-based discrimination. Those within the
sanctuary schemes who would be adversely affected by Regulation B13 were in
fact few in number. It was not in the circumstances a breach of the PSED to
fail to identify in the Equality Impact Assessment this very small group of
those within the sanctuary schemes who had a need for an extra room; this was a
very tiny and specific group.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree but I would make a further and more fundamental point. As A’s
case illustrates, there is no automatic correlation between being in a
sanctuary scheme and having a need for an extra bedroom. The reason that A has
three bedrooms is not that she needs three bedrooms, but that no two bedroom
properties were available when she first moved there. As I have said (at paras
56 to 58) her reasons for wanting to stay where she is are strong but unrelated
to the size of the property. The fact that people may have strong personal or
social reasons for wanting to stay in their property for reasons unrelated to
the number of bedrooms (of which A is one example in her particular
circumstances) was recognised and was planned to be taken account of through
DHPs. Lady Hale takes a different view on this issue, as she does on the issue

</span>Mrs Carmichael lives with her husband in a two-bedroom flat. She has
spina bifida, hydrocephalus, double incontinence, inability to weight bear and
recurring pressure sores. Her husband is her full time carer. She needs a
special bed with an electronic mattress. She also needs a wheelchair beside the
bed. Her husband cannot share the same bed, and there needs to be adequate
space for her husband and nurses to attend to her needs. There is not enough
space for him to have a separate bed in the same room. Their rent was
previously met in full by HB, but this was reduced by 14% under Reg B13. The
shortfall is presently covered by an award of DHP.</p>

by 25% under Reg B13 on the basis that he is under-occupying two bedrooms. (The
fact that one bedroom is occupied on a part-time basis by his stepdaughter
appears to have been overlooked, but that is not the basis of his legal

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>EVOLUTION OF THE POLICY</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The proposed bedroom criteria measure was announced by the government in
the 22 June 2010 budget: 2010 Budget - Responsibility, freedom, fairness: a
five-year plan to re-build the economy (HC 61). It is plain from the published
budget statement that this and other welfare reforms were part and parcel of
the Government’s deficit reduction strategy, though other justifications, in
terms of enterprise and fairness, were also claimed (“reforming the welfare
system to reward work” - para 1.31; “tackle welfare dependency and unaffordable
spending” - para 1.92). Against that general background I may turn to the
evidence concerning the manner and extent of the consideration given by the
Government, as the prospective policy was elaborated over time, to the needs of
the disabled.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">(1)  OFFICIALS’ ADVICE</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In a submission to the Minister for Welfare Reform of 20 August 2010 it
was acknowledged that “[there] are likely to be a number of social sector
tenants who cannot be found suitable alternative social sector accommodation of
the right size”, and specific reference is made to “those caring full time for
a disabled person ...”. On 21 January 2011 officials recorded the minister’s
agreement that “any exemptions eg because the claimant is unable to work due to
a disability, should be contingent on their landlord being unable to offer any
suitable sized accommodation”, and the minister was asked to consider other
groups as possible candidates for exemption. By 12 August 2011 it was being
said there was “a strong case for exempting disabled claimants where
significant adaptations have been made to their properties”. It was suggested
that the minister “announce a £20m per annum increased DHP package for ...
2013/14 and 2014/15”, funded by an increase in the planned reduction rates from
23% to 25%. At paras 6-15 of the officials’ paper of 12 August 2011 there is a
detailed discussion of the background and the options available see also Annex
A to the paper. It includes the statement, at para 9, that “[there] is a strong
case for an exemption from the size criteria measure for disabled people living
in adapted accommodation or properties that have been specially suited to their
needs”. In Annex A the officials canvassed arguments for their recommendation
of “an increase to the DHP pot” (DHPs are payable, as Henderson J observed in <i>Burnip’s
</i>case <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>, para 46, from a capped fund).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From August 2011 onwards there was a consistent view within government
that the most workable solution to the difficulties for the disabled arising
from the impact of the bedroom criteria was an increase in what could be made
available through DHPs. In response to the paper of 12 August 2011, the
minister had asked for more information on the likely reaction of the Treasury
and “the lobby” (a shorthand for various interested groups). In a paper of 2
September 2011 officials note that the lobby had singled out those living in
significantly adapted accommodation as a group which should be exempted. They
indicate (para 4) that they have given consideration to the possibility of
exempting this group and other “hard cases”, and state:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“trying to define ‘significantly
adapted accommodation’ for exemption purposes would not be workable. Such an
exemption would be difficult and expensive to deliver effectively, especially
within universal credit. It would either be too broad brush or leave out many
other, equally deserving cases. We therefore recommend in our submission of 12
August increasing the DHP pot by £20m in 2013/14 and 2014/15. This approach
would enable local authorities to make decisions at a local level about which
cases should be prioritised for financial help to meet any shortfall caused by
this measure.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">The officials note, however,
at para 7:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A DHP approach is likely to
attract criticism for lacking the certainty ... that only an exemption would
appear to be able to offer in these cases ... this approach may produce
inconsistencies in the way individual cases are treated across different parts
of the country.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">At para 8 the officials refer
to a survey carried out by them, to which 56 local authorities and housing
associations had responded, and which (together with meetings with “various
stakeholders”) “is helping to inform our approach to implementation as well as
highlighting the pressure points most likely to be raised in the Lords
Committee stages of the Welfare Reform Bill”. They set out ten key bullet
points from the survey. Three of them were:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“- For those providers questioned
there appears to be a shortage of both one bed homes and much larger four+
homes.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">- The majority of providers
allocate homes to underoccupying households to a certain extent. It is more
common in smaller two bed homes than bigger homes.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">- Most authorities allocate to
underoccupiers most commonly for disabled needs and due to lack of suitable
stock.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 29 September 2011 officials informed the minister that the Treasury
declined to agree the proposed means of funding the suggested DHP package, and
accordingly suggested a revised approach: that the HB reduction rates be revised
upwards, to 14% and 25% for one and two excess bedrooms respectively, and
“[that] we use the increased level of savings to provide a £25m DHP package to
mitigate the impact of this measure in a targeted way”. In the same document
they report amendments received from two members of the House of Lords which
proposed six categories of case for exemption from the reductions. The
officials set out arguments against these proposals, of which the first was
“affordability (most of these would significantly erode savings)”. Then, at
para 16 this appears:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“DHPs provide a targeted means of
mitigating the impact of this measure from a limited funding pot. It is also in
line with a localised approach which will allow local authorities to take into
account the circumstances of individual households.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">More detail is given in the
Annex to the submission of 29 September 2011. Thus:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“18.  Although the
discretionary nature of DHPs can run the risk of uncertainty for individuals,
it does have a number of advantages:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:126.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Wingdings 2&quot;">–<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;
</span></span>It would enable LAs to provide additional help to claimants based
upon a local-level decision about need.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:126.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Wingdings 2&quot;">–<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;
</span></span>It would deliver mitigation in a targeted way that ensures
limited funds are not wasted on cases where the shortfall can be met by the
individual ...</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:126.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Wingdings 2&quot;">–<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;
</span></span>We will also allocate this money to local authorities in a way
that broadly reflects need in relation to the impact of this measure.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">At para 20 of the Annex the
officials state: “Based on average weekly losses from the size criteria, £25m
annual funding [sc the proposed DHP package] would be sufficient to remove
approx 35,000 claimants from the impacts of the social sector size criteria”.
At para 21:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We will monitor demand for DHPs
in relation to this measure and how they are being used by local authorities.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">(2)  CHILDREN’S COMMISSIONER’S PAPER</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In January 2012 the Children’s Commissioner (established by the Children
Act 2004) published a <i>Child Rights Impact Assessment of the Welfare Reform
Bill</i>. I should refer briefly to this given Ms Markus’ submissions on section
149 of the [Equality Act 2010] and the PSED. In section 2 the commissioner
opines that the proposed reductions in HB in the public sector will have
deleterious effects on children:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Such penalties are likely to have
a particular impact on disabled children, where spare rooms may be needed for
equipment storage and/or overnight carers, unless they are excluded from the
Bill. We understand that the DWP’s intention is to make provision for overnight
carers where this is required; however, the [equality impact assessment] says
that there will be provision for a bedroom for overnight carers for ‘the
claimant or their partner’, but does not mention carers for children. Children
waiting for an adoptive family ... will also be affected, as will children
whose care is shared by separated parents [Other examples are given].”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">(3)  EQUALITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND THE JULY AND
AUGUST 2012 CIRCULARS</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In June 2012 the Department for Work and Pensions (“DWP”) published an
updated equality impact assessment on the proposed size criteria for HB. Para 9
refers to the proposal, as it had become, to add £30m per year to the DHP fund
from 2013-14, stating that it was “expected to mitigate some of the impacts of
the measure, in particular the effects on disabled people and those with foster
caring responsibilities”. Paras 20-21 describe the department’s ongoing
discussions with stakeholders. Paras 22 et seq offer a breakdown of the numbers
of HB claimants thought likely to be affected (660,000 altogether), the
distribution of losses among them (from £5 to £25 and over per week), the
numbers who might “float off” HB altogether, tenure types (as between local
authority and housing association tenants), regional distribution of those
affected, and distribution by reference to family circumstances and gender. There
is specific reference to disabled persons, who are accepted, at para 42, as
“more likely to be affected by the introduction of size criteria”, and there is
a prediction, at paras 43-44, that 56% - 63% of those affected will be disabled,
depending on the sense attributed to disability. Para 59 describes the
department’s plans for monitoring and evaluation of the policy’s effects.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In July 2012 Circular HB/CTB A4/2012 was issued to local authorities.
The background to the 2012 Regulations is explained, and the effect of the
changes summarised. Para 9 reacts to the judgments in <i>Burnip’s </i>case
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>, which it will be recalled had been handed down on 15 May 2012.
The circumstances of the first two claimants, who needed the presence of carers
throughout the night, are dealt with in the Regulations (the closing words of
Regulation 13D(3), identical as I have said to B13(5) for those renting in the
public sector). The circular concentrated on the third case in the appeal from <i>Burnip’s</i>
case, that of Mr Gorry:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“9.  Due [sic] to [the
decision in <i>Burnip’s </i>case] those whose children are said to be unable to
share a bedroom because of severe disabilities will be able to claim [HB] for
an extra room from the date of the judgment, 15 May 2012. However it will
remain for local authorities to assess the individual circumstances of the
claimant and their family and decide whether their disabilities are genuinely
such that it is inappropriate for the children to be expected to share a room. This
will involve considering not only the nature and severity of the disability but
also the nature and frequency of care required during the night, and the extent
and regularity of the disturbance to the sleep of the child who would normally
be required to share the bedroom. This will come down to a matter of judgment
on the facts.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">DHPs are addressed later in
the circular. At that stage the extra £30m was “aimed specifically at two
groups: Disabled people living in accommodation that has been substantially adapted
to their needs, ... [and] Foster carers including those between foster
placements” (para 52). This follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“54.  There are many reasons,
as well as those mentioned in para 52, why it may not be appropriate for
someone with a disability to either move house or make up any shortfall in rent
themselves. A good example of this may be an individual or family who rely
heavily on a local support network. In circumstances such as these it may be
appropriate to use the DHP fund to make up the shortfall in their rent.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">Then after describing various
means by which affected persons might be able to make up the shortfall caused
by the reduction in their HB, this appears:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“67.  For those claimants who
cannot cover a reduction in [HB] from their own resources and who have a
compelling case for remaining in their current accommodation, there is the DHP
fund ...”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 1 August 2012 Circular HB/CTB A6/2012 was issued. It was specifically
concerned with the <i>Burnip </i>case: more particularly with facts such as
those of Mr Gorry’s appeal. It indicated, at para 2, that the DWP had sought
permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The advice given in
para 9 of Circular HB/CTB A4/2012 was replicated in para 8. Para 7 also had
this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“When a claimant says that their children
cannot share a bedroom, [local authorities] should expect to be provided with
sufficient medical evidence to satisfy themselves that these factors [sc
claimed severe disability] are sufficiently weighty in the individual case to
make it inappropriate for the children to share a bedroom on a continual basis.
Only in such circumstances will they be justified in making an exception to the
normal application of the size criteria and granting HB on the basis of an
additional bedroom.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">(4)  CIRCULAR HB/CTB U2/2013</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Circular HB/CTB U2/2013was issued on 12 March 2013. As I have
foreshadowed it is material to the third ground of challenge (the deployment of
guidance to prescribe the means of calculating the appropriate maximum HB). It
indicated, at para 5, that the Secretary of State did not propose to pursue the
appeal (or prospective appeal) in <i>Burnip’s </i>case <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>. This
follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“6.  This means that from the
date of the Court of Appeal judgment on 15 May 2012, local authorities (‘LAs’)
should allow an extra bedroom for children who are unable to share because of
their severe disabilities following the guidelines as set out in paras 7 to 10
below.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.  When a claimant says
that their children are unable to share a bedroom, it will be for LAs to
satisfy themselves that this is the case, for example, a claim is likely to be
supported by medical evidence and many children are likely to be in receipt of
disability living allowance (‘DLA’) for their medical condition. In addition
LAs must consider not only the nature and severity of the disability, but also
the nature and frequency of care required during the night, and the extent and
regularity of the disturbance to the sleep of the child who would normally be
required to share the bedroom. In all cases this will come down to a matter of
judgement on facts of each individual case.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">8.  It should be noted that
the judgment does not provide for an extra bedroom in other circumstances, for
example, where the claimant is one of a couple who is unable to share a bedroom
or where an extra room is required for equipment connected with their
disability.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">(5)  THE DHP GUIDANCE MANUAL, APRIL 2013</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This document of April 2013 (the Discretionary Housing Payments Guidance
Manual) (“the DHP Guidance Manual”) contains very full guidance as to the use
of DHPs. It reminds authorities, at para 1.10, that their DHP funds are cash
limited. It reviews the whole scheme. It canvasses the possibility of allowing
applications in advance from persons affected by the HB, at paras 4.5-6, and making
an award not limited in time to a disabled claimant likewise affected, at para
5.3. A “Good Practice Guide” is included in the DHP Guidance Manual. It
contains a substantial discussion of the HB. It states:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“1.10&nbsp; The Government has provided
additional funding towards DHPs following the introduction of the benefit cap. This
additional funding is intended to support those claimants affected by the
benefit cap who, as a result of a number of complex challenges, cannot
immediately move into work or more affordable accommodation.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">Specific types of case are
then enumerated, at para 1.11, and carefully discussed, and worked examples are
given. I should note these passages:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“2.5  For claimants living in
specially adapted accommodation, it will sometimes be more cost-effective for
them to remain in their current accommodation rather than moving them into
accommodation which needs to be adapted. We therefore recommend that local
authorities identify people who fall into this group and invite a claim for
DHPs.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">2.7  The allocation of the
additional funding for disabled people broadly reflects the impact of this
measure and the additional funding needed to support this group. However, due
to the discretionary nature of the scheme, LAs should not specifically exclude
any group affected by the removal of the spare room subsidy or any other
welfare reform. It is important that LAs are flexible in their decision
making.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">Other types of case discussed
include adopters (paras 2.9-11) and foster carers, in particular (para 2.13)
carers for two or more unrelated foster children.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At paras 5.4-5.5 the Good Practice Guide poses a series of practical
questions under two heads, “The household’s medical circumstances, health or
support needs” and “Other circumstances”. The bullet points under the latter
head (13 in number) demonstrate a series of different cases, none of them
necessarily involving disability, in which the claimant may encounter
particular difficulty or hardship in seeking alternative accommodation in
response to the reduction in his/her HB which the local authority may think it
right to consider in deciding whether to make an award of DHP. I will just set
out the first two instances:</p>

of having time to shop around for a reasonably priced property is not

<p class="ParaHeading">(6)  STATEMENTS IN PARLIAMENT</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn next to the parliamentary debates on the 2012 Regulations. It
will be recalled that the Regulations were subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure. On 15 October 2012 in the House of Lords the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State, Lord Freud, referred to the £30m addition to the DHP fund for
2013-14, of which £5m was to be earmarked for foster carers. Concern was
expressed in the debate as to “the dramatic consequences that these regulations
will have for disabled people”. Lord Freud stated (Hansard (HL Debates) 15
October 2012, col GC485):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As noble Lords will remember, the
£30m is divided so that £25m is to cover people with significant adaptations.
We estimate that there are around 35,000 claimants, particularly wheelchair
users, who have accommodation adapted to their needs ... The core question,
raised by [Lord McKenzie and Lady Hollis] was whether there is suitable
accommodation. I know it is a concern. Clearly, it varies across the country. This
is not about making people move into it. Many will prefer to stay. What will
happen in practice is that there will be a very varied effect on individuals. One
can tier up the problems and end up with someone in a very difficult position.
We had some examples today. This is exactly where we would expect the DHP to
come into effect. A lot of people will decide that they will have enough money
or that they will be able to take in a lodger or take extra work. Those are the
kind of decisions that we expect to happen in the marketplace. There will, of
course, be a residue of bigger problems.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the House of Commons on 16 October 2012 the minister, Mr Webb,
answered a question about what the position would be where a disabled or
elderly tenant had had adaptations made to his accommodation. He said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We looked at whether we could
simply exclude any house that had had any adaptation done to it. It quickly
became apparent that there is a spectrum of adaptations ... Trying to define in
legislation that this or that type of adaptation was or was not exempt was very
complex. Rather than having a blanket exemption for a ramp or a stair rail, we
have allocated money to local authorities [sc the £30m DHP], which broadly
matches what we think would be the cost of protecting people in the
circumstances that the Hon gentleman had described ...”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At Prime Minister’s Questions on 7 March 2013 the Prime Minister stated
that “people with severely disabled children are exempt” [from the bedroom
criteria]: Hansard (HC Debates) 6 March 2013, col 949. On 12 March 2013 the
Secretary of State, in a written ministerial statement, referred to the DHP
Guidance to be issued the following month (and which I have described above)
and indicated that he would “closely monitor and adjust the implementation of
the policy ... to ensure that the needs of these groups [ priority groups other
than foster carers and armed forces personnel] are effectively addressed in the
longer term”: Hansard (HC Debates) 12 March 2013, col 10WS.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">LADY HALE: (dissenting

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is perhaps unfortunate that two very different sorts of case, raising
very different issues about the removal of the spare room subsidy, should have
been dealt with together. As Lord Toulson has demonstrated, the disability
cases are about whether people need extra space because of their disability.
The link between the number of bedrooms for which housing benefit is paid and
their needs is direct and obvious. The regulation denies them the benefit they
need to pay for the amount of space they need. The case of A, and others like
her in sanctuary schemes, is different. Her need is not for space but to stay
where she is. The effect of the regulation is to deny her the benefit she needs
in order to stay in the accommodation she needs. In my view this is unjustified
discrimination against her on grounds of her sex. But the reasons are quite
different from the reasons in the disability cases.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has been recognised for a long time, both nationally and
internationally, that the State has a positive obligation to provide effective
protection for vulnerable people against ill-treatment and abuse, not only from
agents of the State but also from private individuals. The aim of such
protection is effective deterrence: prevention of the abuse taking place at all
is a far more effective remedy than punishment or compensation after the event.
Several of the Convention rights may be violated by the failure to provide
effective protection. Thus, in the well-known case of <i>X and Y v The
Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1985/4.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 235</a>, the failure of the authorities to provide
the protection of the criminal law for a mentally disabled young woman against
sexual abuse was a violation of the right to respect for private life under
article 8. In <i>Z v United Kingdom </i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/333.html">34 EHRR 3</a>, the failure to
provide the protection of the child care system for a family of children
against prolonged neglect by their parents was a violation of their right not
to be subjected to ill-treatment under article 3. In <i>Opuz v Turkey </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/870.html">(2010) 50 EHRR 28</a>, the failure to provide the protection of the criminal law or a safe
haven scheme for a wife against repeated violent attacks by her husband was a
violation of her rights under article 3.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, in <i>Opuz v Turkey</i>, the court also recognised that
this failure was a breach of article 14, the right to the equal enjoyment of
the Convention rights, because gender-based violence such as this has been
internationally recognised as a form of discrimination against women. The court
quoted, among other things, article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) which defines discrimination
as:</a></p><a name="para74">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[A]ny distinction, exclusion or
restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of
impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women,
irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women,
of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social,
cultural, civil or any other field.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Obviously, to deny women protection against gender-based
violence, such that they cannot live an equal life with men, is discrimination
against them in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights. As the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights put it, in resolution 2003/45:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[A]ll forms of violence against
women occur within the context of <i>de iure </i>and <i>de facto</i>
discrimination against women and the lower status accorded to women in society
and are exacerbated by the obstacles women often face in seeking remedies from
the state.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is greatly to the credit of the United Kingdom that domestic law
began to develop more effective remedies against gender-based violence in the
1970s, following the recognition of the problem in the Report of the House of
Commons Select Committee on <i>Violence in Marriage</i> (1974-75) HC 553. It
was widely recognised that the criminal law is often an ineffective remedy. The
shocking facts of Ms A’s case, not unlike the shocking facts of <i>Opuz v Turkey</i>,
but with a far more robust response from the criminal justice system, show all
too clearly that there is a class of dangerous and determined abusers who will
not be put off by the criminal law, however effectively it is deployed.
Parliaments of all political persuasions have recognised that what is needed
are, firstly, ways of getting the abuser out of the home, beginning with the
Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976 and now contained in
Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996, together with the Domestic Violence, Crime
and Victims Act 2004, and secondly, ways of getting alternative accommodation
for the victim, beginning with the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 and now
contained in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996. Sanctuary schemes are a further
development. They recognise the positive obligation of the State to provide a
safe haven for a comparatively small number of victims who are at risk of
really serious violence.</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The state has provided Ms A with such a safe haven. It allocated her a
three-bedroom house when she did not need one. That was not her choice. It
later fortified that house and put in place a detailed plan to keep her and her
son safe. Reducing her housing benefit by reference to the number of bedrooms
puts at risk her ability to stay there. Because of its special character, it
will be difficult if not impossible for her to move elsewhere and that would
certainly put the State to yet further expense. Given these very special
circumstances, I am tempted to regard this as an interference with her and her
son’s right to respect for their home. But in any event, denying her the
benefit she needs in order to be able to stay there is discrimination in the
sense described in <i>Thlimmenos v Greece </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/162.html">31 EHRR 15</a>: treating her
like any other single parent with one child when in fact she ought to be
treated differently.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the appellant does not seriously dispute that Ms A needs to stay
where she is. The Secretary of State accepts that she needs to stay in a
sanctuary scheme and probably in this very house. The justification suggested
for the interference, or the discrimination, is the availability of
discretionary housing payments to make up the shortfall in her rent. But if the
discretionary housing payment scheme is not good enough to justify the
discrimination against the Rutherford and Carmichael households, it is not good
enough to justify the discrimination against Ms A’s household either. Its
deficiencies were acknowledged in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Burnip v
Birmingham City Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 629</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>, para 46. They
are well-summed up by Mr Drabble QC on behalf of the Rutherford and Carmichael
families: it is discretionary, cash-limited and produces less certainty; it has
a stricter means test; it offers different and less attractive routes of
judicial challenge; it can be onerous to make applications; and it encourages
short term, temporary and conditional awards. For a woman in a sanctuary scheme
to have to endure all those difficulties and uncertainties on top of the
constant fear and anxiety in which she lives cannot be justified. This is not a
question of the allocation of scarce public resources: it is rightly
acknowledged that public resources will have to meet this need one way or
another.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, her circumstances may change, just as the size of any
household, and the age and sex of its members may change. The housing benefit
scheme already caters for such changes. It could cater for a relevant change in
her circumstances. Nor has it been demonstrated that there are insuperable
practical difficulties in the way of drafting an exception to the size criteria
in regulation B13 to cater for victims of gender-based violence who are in
sanctuary schemes and need for that reason to stay where they are. Such cases
cannot be equated with other people who would prefer to stay where they are,
even if they have quite a compelling case for doing so, such as carers for
older people who need to stay near their support networks or even disabled
people living in specially adapted accommodation, like JD and AD. In the first
example, it is not clear that this group would constitute a “status” for
article 14 purposes. But even if it did, their needs will require individual
evaluation, perhaps in the context of a social care needs assessment, before it
is clear that staying where they are is the right or only solution. Such an
evaluation can only take place in the context of the discretionary housing
payment scheme, despite its disadvantages. But if the need is clearly
established, then it would be irrational to refuse to meet it. In the second
example, the disability is indeed a status for article 14 purposes, and I have
found the case of JD and AD an extremely difficult one and have been tempted to
dissent in their case too. But the distinction between them and the victims of
the sex discrimination entailed in gender-based violence, is that the state has
a positive obligation to provide effective protection against gender-based
violence and for this small group of victims this is the only way to make that
protection effective.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would reach this conclusion without consideration of the public sector
equality duty. However, I cannot accept that it was properly complied with in
this case. The Secretary of State was required to “have due regard to the need
to - (a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other
conduct that is prohibited by or under this Act; (b) advance equality of opportunity
between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who
do not share it” (Equality Act 2010, section 149(1)). Advancing equality of
opportunity “involves having due regard, in particular, to the need to - (a)
remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by persons who share a relevant
protected characteristic that are connected to that characteristic; (b) take
steps to meet the needs of persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic that are different from the needs of persons who do not share it;
…” (section 149(3)). The Equality Impact Statement prepared in June 2012
addressed the impact on gender in three paragraphs, noting that more women than
men would be affected by the size criteria, because there are more female than
male housing benefit claimants, but concluding that there was no differential
impact by gender. There was nothing about women who are victims of gender-based
violence or those within sanctuary schemes. The Court of Appeal concluded that
because there would be very few in sanctuary schemes who would be adversely
affected by regulation B13, it was not a breach of the public sector equality
duty to fail to identify them (para 59).</a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although gender-based violence is recognised by the European Court of
Human Rights and elsewhere as a form of discrimination against women, it is
perhaps unlikely to be a form of discrimination prohibited by the 2010 Act,
which I take to be the scope of section 149(1)(a) of that Act. But it is
undoubtedly a disadvantage suffered by people, namely women, who share a
relevant protected characteristic within the meaning of section 149(3)(a) and
produces needs that are different from those of people who do not share it
within the meaning of section 149(3)(b). This brings it within the need to
enhance equality of opportunity to which due regard is to be had under section
149(1)(b). In my view, therefore, the public sector equality duty requires
public authorities at least to consider the impact of their decisions and actions
on the victims of gender-based violence. This is not much to ask. People in
sanctuary schemes may be small in number but victims of gender-based violence
are many. Public authorities should take their needs into account when
developing their policies. They are likely to make better decisions as a
result. And they will be able to explain them better.</a></p><a name="para80">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State in Ms A’s
case and allow her cross appeal. I agree with Lord Toulson’s judgment on the
disability cases.</a></p><a name="para81">
