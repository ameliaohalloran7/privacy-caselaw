<p class="NewSpeech">LADY HALE: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom Lord
Kerr, Lord Reed, Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental issue in this case is a simple one. Is it compatible
with the European Convention on Human Rights to deny British citizenship to the
child of a British father and a non-British mother simply because they were not
married to one another at the time of his birth or at any time thereafter? If
the parents had been married to one another, their child would have been a
British citizen. If the mother had been British and the father non-British,
their child would have been a British citizen. If the child had been born after
1 July 2006 he would have been a British citizen. The child is not responsible for
the marital status of his parents or the date of his birth, yet it is he who
suffers the consequences.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are many benefits to being a British citizen, among them the right
to vote, the right to live and to work here without needing permission to do so,
and everything that comes along with those rights. This case is about the right
not to be deported on the ground that one is a “foreign criminal” whose
presence here is not conducive to the public good. But the unsympathetic
context in which the issue arises should not distract us from the importance of
the issue to anyone who was born to unmarried parents at the relevant time.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading">The facts</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant was born on 18 March 1985 in Jamaica. His mother was
Jamaican and his father British. His paternity is not in doubt. His parents
were not married to one another. Under the law then in force the appellant
became a citizen of Jamaica but not a British citizen. His father brought him
to the United Kingdom in 1989, when he was aged four, and he has lived here ever
since. He or his father might have made an application for him to be registered
as a British citizen while he was still a child and it would have been the
policy of the UK government to grant such an application provided that, if the
child was 16 or over, he was of good character. But no such application was
made. He was, however, granted indefinite leave to remain here in 1992, just
before his seventh birthday.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Neither has the appellant since applied to be registered as a British
citizen. It is accepted that such an application would not succeed, because the
appellant cannot demonstrate that he is of good character. He has a very
serious criminal record and has been convicted of offences from 2003, the year
in which he reached the age of 18, until 2008, when he was convicted of
manslaughter and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In March 2011, the Secretary of State served notice upon him that he was
liable to automatic deportation as a “foreign criminal” under section 32(5) of
the UK Borders Act 2007. A deportation order was made in August that same year.
On appeal, the First-tier Tribunal held that he had both a private and a family
life in this country but that his deportation was a proportionate and lawful
interference with them. The tribunal remitted to the Secretary of State the
question whether his deportation was unlawfully discriminatory, given that he
would not have been liable to deportation had his parents been married to one
another. One year later, in August 2012, the Secretary of State set removal
directions for his removal on 16 September 2012 and these judicial review
proceedings were launched to challenge them, principally on the ground that he
still had an extant appeal.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The removal directions were stayed by the court and on 19 November 2012
the Secretary of State accepted that they should not have been issued given the
tribunal’s decision to remit. On 23 November 2012, she reconsidered her
deportation decision but decided that it was not unlawfully discriminatory and
refused to revoke it. She also certified that the appellant’s claim was clearly
unfounded and thus that he had no right of appeal within this country against
the decision. These proceedings were amended to challenge that decision and its
certification.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In July 2014, Dingemans J held that the discrimination against a child
of unmarried parents was not justified at the time of his birth and continued
to be unjustified; that there had been a violation of article 14 of the
Convention read with article 8; and that the certification of the claim as
clearly unfounded was unlawful. He quashed the certificate, but declined either
to read the relevant legislative provisions so as to entitle the appellant to
British citizenship under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 or to make a
declaration of incompatibility under section 4: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2014/2386.html">[2014] EWHC 2386 (Admin)</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In January 2016, the Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of State’s
appeal, finding that there had been no violation of the Convention rights at
the time of the appellant’s birth in 1985 and no wrong for which the UK courts
could have given a remedy then. The matter had to be judged at that time rather
than as a continuing act. Any violation had taken effect before the Human
Rights Act came into force. Hence there was no violation of the Convention
rights and thus the claim could be certified as clearly unfounded: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/22.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 22</a>. The appellant now appeals to this court.</p>

added, by section 9(1) of the 2002 Act, with effect from 1 July 2006, as
follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this

<p class="ParaLevel1">Section 162(5) of the 2002 Act made it clear that section 9
would have effect only in relation to a child born on or after the date

</span>These provisions define people who are automatically entitled to British
citizenship, whether they want it or not. Other people can apply to be
registered as British citizens. Section 3(1) of the 1981 Act provides that
applications may be made while a person is a minor for him to be registered as
a British citizen; and from 1987 onwards it was the policy of the Secretary of
State to grant, on satisfactory proof of paternity, applications made by or on
behalf of minors whose unmarried fathers were British citizens, who were living
in the United Kingdom, and who, if aged 16 or over, were of good character.
Section 65 of the Immigration Act 2014 has now introduced sections 4E to 4I
into the 1981 Act, giving a specific right to be registered to people who were
unable to acquire citizenship automatically because their father was not
married to their mother. But this is subject to the general provision governing
applications for registration, under section 41A of the 1981 Act, that such an
application “must not be granted unless the Secretary of State is satisfied
that the adult or young person is of good character”.</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="ParaHeading">The progressive removal of discrimination against children
of unmarried parents</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At common law, a child of parents who were not married to one another at
the time of his birth was <i>filius nullius </i>or “nobody’s child”. The law
scarcely recognised his relationship with his mother, let alone with his
father. Relationships traced otherwise than through marriage were ignored for
the purpose of succession and other dispositions of property. References to
children or other relationships in legislation or other legal instruments were
presumed to refer only to those born within or traced through marriage. Case
law and statute gradually accorded limited recognition to the relationship
between mother and child but scarcely any to the relationship between father
and child. The first major reform came with the Family Law Reform Act 1969,
which implemented the recommendations of the Report of the Russell Committee on
<i>The Law of Succession in relation to Illegitimate Persons</i> (1966, Cmnd
3051). As the Committee observed, in the archaic language of the time (pp 4-5):</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“At the root of any suggestion for
the improvement of the lot of bastards in relation to the law of succession to
property is, of course, that in one sense they start level with legitimate
children, in that no child is created of its own volition. Whatever may be said
of the parents, the bastard is innocent of any wrongdoing. To allot him an
inferior, or indeed an unrecognised, status in succession is to punish him for
a wrong of which he is not guilty.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Accordingly, the 1969 Act gave children of unmarried
parents rights of intestate succession from both their parents, and vice versa,
and enacted a presumption that references to children and other relatives in
dispositions of property included references to, and to persons related
through, illegitimate children.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next major reform came with the Family Law Reform Act 1987, which
implemented the Law Commission’s <i>Report on Illegitimacy </i>(1982, Law Com
No 118, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/other/EWLC/1982/118.html">[1982] EWLC 118</a>) with modifications recommended in its <i>Illegitimacy: Second Report </i>(1986,
Law Com No 157, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/other/EWLC/1986/157.html">[1986] EWLC 157</a>). The object was to remove all discrimination in family law
against children whose parents were not married to one another and against
relationships traced otherwise than through marriage (while preserving some
distinction between the parents in relation to their upbringing). The drafting
technique, borrowed from the Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986,
was to avoid using adjectives such as “legitimate” and “illegitimate” to
describe the child and to refer instead to the relationship between the
parents. Section 1(1) of the 1987 Act provides:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this Act and enactments passed
and instruments made after the coming into force of this section, references
(however expressed) to any relationship between two persons shall, unless the
contrary intention appears, be construed without regard to whether or not the
father and mother of either of them, or the father and mother of any person
through whom the relationship is deduced, have or had been married to each
other at any time.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But that, of course, does not apply to the 1981 Act, which was passed
before the 1987 Act came into force. The Law Commission had considered the law
of citizenship in its first Report and concluded that, as a matter of policy, a
“non-marital” child should be entitled to British citizenship on the same terms
as a “marital” child (Law Com No 118, para 11.20). But no clauses relating to
this were included in the draft Bill annexed to that Report, or in the draft
Bill annexed to the second Report, because citizenship is a United Kingdom
matter affecting each part of the United Kingdom as well as England and Wales.</a></p><a name="para16">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may well be as a result of the enactment of the 1987 Act that the
Secretary of State adopted the policy in relation to the registration of minor
children of unmarried parents referred to above (para 13). But the law itself
was not changed until the 2002 Act came into force.</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="ParaHeading">Deportation law</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>British citizens cannot be deported. Non-citizens may be deported if the
Secretary of State deems this “conducive to the public good” (Immigration Act
1971, section 3(5)(a)). Section 32(4) of the UK Borders Act 2007 provides that,
for this purpose, the deportation of a “foreign criminal” is conducive to the
public good. Under section 32(1) a non-citizen convicted in the United Kingdom
of an offence for which he was sentenced to at least 12 months’ imprisonment is
a “foreign criminal”. Section 32(5) provides that the Secretary of State must
make a deportation order in respect of a foreign criminal, but this is subject
to section 33. Section 33(1) provides that section 32(4) and (5) do not apply
where an exception applies. By section 33(2), “Exception 1 is where removal of
the foreign criminal in pursuance of the deportation order would breach - (a) a
person’s Convention rights …” By section 33(7) the application of an exception
does not prevent the making of a deportation order and section 32(4) applies
despite the application of Exception 1. The net effect is that if Exception 1
applies, section 32(5) does not, and the person is not liable to automatic
deportation. Deportation is nevertheless still deemed conducive to the public
good and the Secretary of State <i>may</i> still make a deportation order, but
it would be contrary to the person’s Convention rights actually to deport him.</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="ParaHeading">Immigration appeals</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the relevant time, in 2012, immigration appeals were governed by
sections 82 and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as they
then stood. Section 82(1) gave a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
against an “immigration decision”, an expression which included a decision that
section 32(5) of the 2007 Act applied to a person, but did not include the
making of a deportation order which stated that it was made in accordance with
section 32(5). Under section 84 of the 2002 Act, the grounds of appeal
included, at (a), that the decision was not in accordance with the Immigration
Rules; at (c), that the decision was unlawful under section 6 of the Human
Rights Act 1998 as being incompatible with the appellant’s Convention rights;
and at (e), that the decision was not otherwise in accordance with the law.
Under section 92, only certain appeals might be brought within the United
Kingdom. These included human rights claims. But section 94 gave the Secretary
of State power to prevent an in-country appeal by certifying that the claim was
“clearly unfounded”.</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="ParaHeading">The issues</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Much of the argument in the courts below focussed upon (1) whether the
denial of automatic citizenship at birth was a “one off” act, which took place
before the Human Rights Act came into force, or whether it had continuing
consequences which could amount to a violation of the Convention rights; and
(2) even if it were not a “one off” act, whether the appellant’s liability to
deportation was caused by the initial discrimination or whether that was only
one of a number of contributory factors, not least his failure to apply for
citizenship when he could have done and his commission of serious crimes.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the subject matter of these proceedings is the Secretary of
State’s certificate that an appeal under section 82 of the 2002 Act is “clearly
unfounded”. It is argued that the Secretary of State has no alternative but to
treat the appellant as a “foreign criminal” to whom section 32(5) of the 2007
Act applies and is therefore required to make a deportation order. This is because,
by virtue of the statutory provisions described above, he is not a British
citizen. Thus, it is argued, her action is not unlawful within the meaning of
section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, even if it is incompatible with his
Convention rights, because section 6(2)(a) provides that it is not unlawful to
act incompatibly with the Convention rights if, as a result of one or more
provisions of primary legislation, she could not have acted differently.</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, as we have already seen (para 18 above), Exception 1 does not
require that there be a breach of section 6 of the 1998 Act, merely that the
deportation be a breach of the Convention rights. If Exception 1 applies, then
section 32(5) of the 2007 Act does not apply and a deportation order cannot
lawfully be made under that provision. To similar effect is rule 397 of the
Immigration Rules, which provides that “A deportation order will not be made if
the person’s removal pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK’s
obligations under … the Human Rights Convention”. The grounds of appeal under
section 84(1), as it stood at the relevant time, included, not only, at (a),
that the decision was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules, but also,
at (e), that it was not in accordance with the law. Thus it matters not that
ground (c) is limited to decisions that are contrary to section 6 of the 1998
Act, provided that there is a breach of the Convention rights. Section 6(2)(a)
of that Act is a red herring.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue, therefore, is whether an appeal against the decision that
section 32(5) of the 2007 Act applies to the appellant, on the basis that to
deport the appellant now would be a breach of the UK’s obligations under the
Human Rights Convention, is clearly unfounded. That depends upon (1) whether it
is sufficiently within the ambit of article 8 of the Convention to bring into
play the prohibition of discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention
rights in article 14; (2) whether the discrimination had a “one off effect” at
birth or whether it has continuing consequences which may amount to a present
violation of the Convention rights; and (3) whether such discriminatory effect
can be justified. The discrimination complained of in this case is that he is
liable to deportation whereas he would not be if (a) his mother and father had
been married to one another at the time of his birth; (b) his mother and father
had been married to one another at any time after his birth; (c) his mother had
been British and his father Jamaican; or (d) an application had been made to
register him as a citizen before he was 18.</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="ParaHeading">Article 8</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although article 15.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says
that “Everyone has the right to a nationality”, the European Convention says
nothing about the right to a nationality. In <i>K and W v The Netherlands </i>(1985) 43 D &amp; R 216, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1985/15.html">(1986) 8 EHRR CD95</a>, the European Commission on Human Rights declared inadmissible
a complaint about Dutch citizenship law: a woman married to a Dutch man could
obtain citizenship simply by writing to the local mayor; a man married to a
Dutch woman could not. The Commission found that the right to acquire a
particular nationality was not covered by, or sufficiently related to, article
8 or any other provision of the Convention, for article 14 to come into play.
In <i>Karassev v Finland </i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1999/200.html">28 EHRR CD132</a>, the Commission repeated that
the Convention did not guarantee the right to acquire a particular nationality.
Nevertheless, it did “not exclude that an arbitrary denial of citizenship might
in certain circumstances raise an issue under article 8 of the Convention
because of the impact of such a denial on the private life of the individual.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Genovese</i> <i>v Malta </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1590.html">(2014) 58 EHRR 25</a>, the complaint was
that the denial of Maltese citizenship to the son of a British mother and a Maltese
father who were not married to one another was in breach of article 14 read
with article 8. The Court held (para 33) that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“While the right to citizenship is
not as such a Convention right and while its denial in the present case was not
such as to give rise to a violation of article 8, the Court considers that its impact
on the applicant’s social identity was such as to bring it within the general
scope and ambit of that article.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Malta was not obliged to recognise the right to citizenship
by descent, but as it did so, it had to ensure that the right was secured
without discrimination. The discrimination could not be justified by the
argument that “motherhood is certain, whereas fatherhood is not”: in that case,
paternity had been established scientifically and in legal proceedings.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To similar effect is <i>Kuric v Slovenia </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1083.html">(2013) 56 EHRR 20</a>, where
the discriminatory erasure of the applicants’ residence rights was held to be a
breach of article 14 read with article 8 even though their residence had not in
fact been affected. It is well established that a person’s social identity is
an important component of his private life, which is entitled to respect under
article 8. This includes the recognition of his biological relationships, even
if the refusal of recognition has no noticeable impact upon his family life.
Thus, for example, in <i>Menneson v France, Labassee v France, </i>App Nos
65192/11 and 65941/11, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/664.html">[2014] ECHR 664</a>, Judgment of 26 June 2014, it was a violation of the
right to respect for private life for French law to deny the existence of the
relationship between the biological father and the children born as a result of
surrogacy arrangements in the United States.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear, therefore, that the denial of citizenship, having such an
important effect upon a person’s social identity, is sufficiently within the
ambit of article 8 to trigger the application of the prohibition of
discrimination in article 14.</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="ParaHeading">A continuing effect?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal held that the denial of automatic citizenship was a
“one off” event that happened at birth and had no continuing effect capable of
being a violation of the Convention rights. For example, in <i>Posti and Rahko
v Finland </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/634.html">(2003) 37 EHRR 6</a>, the restriction on the applicants’ right to
fish in state-owned waters, imposed by a decree in 1994, obviously continued to
limit their fishing, but was a single event and their complaint was out of
time. However, the court reiterated that “the concept of a ‘continuing
situation’ refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities
by or on the part of the state to render the applicants victims” (para 39).
Thus, in <i>Norris v Ireland </i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1988/22.html">(1991) 13 EHRR 186</a>, it was held that the very
existence of legislation penalising homosexual acts “continuously and directly”
affected the applicant’s private life, despite the fact that he had neither
been prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution. In this case, the denial of
citizenship has a current and direct effect upon the appellant who is currently
liable to action by the state, in the shape of deportation, as a result.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Article 14</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not in dispute that birth outside wedlock is a “status” for the
purpose of article 14. It has been so regarded at the very least since the
landmark case of <i>Marckx v Belgium </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/2.html">(1979) 2 EHRR 330</a>. It is no
co-incidence that the laws of both Scotland and England and Wales were changed
within a few years of that decision. Nor can it be seriously disputed that
there is here a difference in treatment between people who are otherwise in an
analogous situation on the ground of that birth status: had the appellant’s
parents been married to one another he would automatically have become a
British citizen and not been liable to deportation no matter how badly he had
behaved.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As has been said many times, “For the purpose of article 14, a
difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable
justification, that is, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is
not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and
the aim sought to be realised” (see, eg, <i>Inze v Austria </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1987/28.html">(1988) 10 EHRR 394</a>, para 41; <i>Genovese v Malta</i>, para 43). It is also clear that birth
outside wedlock falls within the class of “suspect” grounds, where “very
weighty reasons” are required to justify discrimination. This was held as long
ago as <i>Inze v Austria</i>, at para 41, where children born in wedlock were
given priority over children born outside wedlock in the inheritance of a
family farm:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The question of equality between
children born in and children born out of wedlock as regards their civil rights
is today given importance in the member states of the Council of Europe. This
is shown by the 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children born
out of Wedlock, which is presently in force in respect of nine member states of
the Council of Europe [including Austria]. Very weighty reasons would
accordingly have to be advanced before a difference in treatment on the ground
of birth out of wedlock could be regarded as compatible with the Convention.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The likelihood that a child born outside wedlock would have
had less to do with the family farm, and the attitudes of the rural population,
were not regarded as weighty reasons.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The need for “very weighty reasons” has been repeated many times since,
for example, in <i>Fabris v France</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/128.html">(2013) 57 EHRR 19</a>, at paras 58 and 59,
where reference was made to “the principle of equality eliminating the very
concepts of legitimate children and children born outside marriage”, and in <i>Genovese
v Malta</i>, at para 44, where it was noted that 22 member states were now
parties to the 1975 Convention and it was irrelevant that Malta was not. The
United Kingdom signed the Convention in 1975 and ratified it in 1981.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This case has, however, been bedevilled by arguments about precisely
what has to be justified. If it is the initial denial of automatic citizenship
in 1985, the Secretary of State can argue that it was not even recognised as
within the ambit of article 8 at the time and so does not need justification.
If it is the continued denial of citizenship in 2012, the Secretary of State
can argue that steps have now been taken to put right the historic injustice,
but that it is justifiable for these steps only to operate prospectively: it is
reasonable to have a citizenship law which assigns citizenship to certain
people automatically at birth and grants it later only on application.
Citizenship should not be imposed upon people unless they have asked for it: it
may bring disadvantages if they are also citizens of a state which does not
recognise dual nationality. The problem with that argument is that citizenship
is imposed automatically at birth upon certain people, whether they want it or
not and whether or not it gives rise to dual nationality problems. Furthermore
it is also imposed automatically if a person is legitimated by the subsequent
marriage of his parents. The appellant’s problems would be over if his mother
could be found and his father persuaded to marry her.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If what needs to be justified is the liability of non-citizens to
deportation while citizens cannot be deported, the Secretary of State would
have a comparatively simple task. It has always been justifiable to distinguish
between citizens and aliens in matters relating to entering, remaining in and
removal from the country. The right to live in one’s own country is the
principal right of citizenship. Further, if what needs to be justified is the
liability of foreign criminals to be deported when other foreigners are not
similarly liable (although their presence here may be controlled in other
ways), again the Secretary of State might have a comparatively easy task.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But in this case what needs to be justified is the current liability of
the appellant, and others whose parents were not married to one another when
they were born or at any time thereafter, to be deported when they would not be
so liable had their parents been married to one another at any time after their
birth. That is a present distinction which is based solely on the accident of
birth outside wedlock, for which the appellant is not responsible, and no
justification has been suggested for it. It is impossible to say that his claim
that Exception 1 applies, based on article 14 read with article 8, is “clearly
unfounded”.</a></p><a name="para34">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that I would allow this appeal and quash the Secretary of
State’s certificate. The consequence, as I understand it, is that his appeal
against the Secretary of State’s decision of 23 November 2012 must be allowed
to proceed and, for the reasons given earlier, is certain to succeed.</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="ParaHeading">Declaration of incompatibility?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Allowing this appeal is the consequence of the particular provisions
relating to deportation which are relevant here. However, there are bound to be
other people in the appellant’s situation - that is, who are denied the automatic
right to citizenship by reason of the fact that their British father was not
married to their non-British mother at the time of their birth. There are all
sorts of current consequences which might flow from that situation. An example
is the right to vote, which is an aspect of citizenship and also a Convention
right under article 3 of the First Protocol. People born before 1 July 2006 are
denied that right unless they are first registered as citizens. In order to do
this they must pass the “good character” test in section 41A of the 1981 Act.
Had their parents been married to one another at or at any time after their
birth they would not have to do this. While of course all babies arrive in the
world with a good character the same cannot be said of those legitimated by the
subsequent marriage of their parents. The distinction is based solely on birth
status and for the reasons given earlier cannot be justified.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Hugh Southey QC, for the appellant, argued that it followed that the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 11) Order 2006,
SI 2006/1498, bringing into force the 2002 amendments to section 50(9) of the
1981 Act was incompatible with the Convention rights. It should have operated
retrospectively so as to grant automatic citizenship to all people previously
denied it because of their parents’ marital status. Mr Tim Eicke QC, for the
Secretary of State, argues that it is contrary to principle for legislation to
have retrospective effect, in particular where it effects an automatic change
of status. Citizenship should not be imposed upon people unless they have asked
for it.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As already mentioned, Mr Eicke’s argument cannot be taken too far: there
are many people who are entitled at birth to the citizenship of more than one country
whether they like it or not: they may be born in a country, such as the United
States of America, which still recognises the <i>ius soli</i>, the right to
citizenship of all persons born within the territory; and they may be entitled
to citizenship by descent from either or both of their parents, as is the case
under the 1981 Act. But where a person has not automatically acquired
citizenship at birth, it is reasonable to expect him to apply for it, even if
he is entitled to be registered if he does so. This avoids the risk of
inconvenient results and provides everyone with clarity and certainty. But it
is not reasonable to impose the additional hurdle of a good character test upon
persons who would, but for their parents’ marital status, have automatically acquired
citizenship at birth, as this produces the discriminatory result that a person
will be deprived of citizenship status because of an accident of birth which is
no fault of his.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The incompatible provision, therefore, is paragraph 70 of Schedule 9 to
the Immigration Act 2014, which inserts into section 41A of the 1981 Act (the
requirement to be of good character) a reference to sections 4F, 4G, 4H and 4I,
which relate to various categories of people who would automatically have
become UK citizens had their parents been married to one another at their
birth. The court will make a declaration to that effect, although it is not
necessary to do so in order to dispose of this case.</a></p><a name="para39">
