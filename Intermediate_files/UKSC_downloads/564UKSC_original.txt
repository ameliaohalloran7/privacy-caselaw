<p class="NewSpeech">LORD REED AND LORD HODGE: (<span style="text-transform:none">with
whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Clarke and Lord Carnwath agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>During the period with which this case is concerned, the claimants (whom
we shall refer to as “Littlewoods”) carried on catalogue sales businesses: that
is to say, they distributed catalogues to customers and sold them goods shown
in the catalogues. In order to carry on their businesses, they employed agents,
who received a commission in return for their services. They could elect to be
paid the commission either in cash or in kind. Commission was paid in cash at
the rate of 10% of the sales achieved by the agent. Commission paid in kind
took the form of goods supplied by Littlewoods, equal in price to 12.5% of the
sales achieved by the agent.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As suppliers of goods, Littlewoods were obliged to account to HMRC for
the VAT due in respect of their chargeable supplies. Between 1973 and 2004,
they accounted for VAT on the supplies which they made to their agents, as
commission paid in kind, on the basis that the taxable amount of those supplies
was reduced by the enhancement in the commission, that is to say by 2.5%. On a
correct understanding of VAT law, the taxable amount of the supplies was
actually reduced by the entire 12.5% which constituted the agents’ commission.
Consequently, Littlewoods accounted for and paid more VAT to HMRC than was due.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 2002 and 2004 Littlewoods submitted claims to HMRC for the
repayment of overpaid VAT in accordance with section 80 of the Value Added Tax
Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”). In 2004, HMRC conceded that VAT had been overpaid,
and since then it has been paid on the correct basis.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 2005 and 2008, HMRC repaid £205m in accordance with section 80.
In accordance with section 78 of the 1994 Act, HMRC also paid interest on the
amount repaid. The interest was calculated on a simple basis, as section 78
required, and totalled £268m.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these proceedings, commenced in 2007, Littlewoods seek additional
interest, calculated on a compound basis, on the ground that such interest is
due under the common law. The additional interest totals £1.25 billion. The
amount involved is so enormous because, under the law of limitation applicable
to common law claims, the ordinary limitation period of six years does not
begin to run, where an action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,
until the claimant has discovered the mistake or could with reasonable
diligence have discovered it: Limitation Act 1980, section 32(1)(c).
Littlewoods maintain that the period over which the interest has to be compounded,
on that basis, is over 40 years.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A further 5,000 claims for compound interest in connection with VAT or
other taxes are stayed pending the resolution of these claims. The total amount
involved in relation to VAT claims is estimated by HMRC at £17 billion.</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="ParaHeading">The basis of the claims</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claims for compound interest are made on two bases. First, it is
argued that HMRC are under a liability to make restitution on the basis that
they were unjustly enriched by payments made under a mistake of law, applying
the principle established in <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln</i> <i>County

</span>Littlewoods contend that these common law claims are not excluded by
sections 78 and 80 of the 1994 Act, as a matter of statutory construction. They
also contend that, in any event, they have a right under EU law to compound
interest on tax levied contrary to EU law. On that basis, they contend that,
even if their claims to compound interest would otherwise be excluded by the
provisions of the 1994 Act, the statute must be disapplied, or interpreted in
such a way as to permit the claims to be made.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>A trial on liability was held before Vos J. In his judgment, he held
that, as a matter of statutory construction, the claims were excluded by
sections 78 and 80 of the 1994 Act: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1071.html">[2010] EWHC 1071 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1071.html">[2010] STC 2072</a>. He
also held that the question whether the exclusion of the claims by those
provisions was contrary to EU law should be referred to the Court of Justice of
the EU. In a subsequent judgment, he determined the questions to be referred,
and made the order for reference: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2771.html">[2010] EWHC 2771 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2771.html">[2011] STC 171</a>. At the

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The questions referred were the following:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><b>Question 1:</b></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">Where a taxable person has
overpaid VAT which was collected by the member state contrary to the
requirements of EU VAT legislation, does the remedy provided by a member state
accord with EU law if that remedy provides only for (a) reimbursement of the
principal sums overpaid, and (b) simple interest on those sums in accordance
with national legislation, such as section 78 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><b>Question 2:</b></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">If not, does EU law require
that the remedy provided by a member state should provide for (a) reimbursement
of the principal sums overpaid, and (b) payment of compound interest as the
measure of the use value of the sums overpaid in the hands of the member state and/or
the loss of the use value of the money in the hands of the taxpayer?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><b>Question 3:</b></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">If the answer to both
questions one and two is in the negative, what must the remedy that EU law
requires the member state to provide include, in addition to reimbursement of
the principal sums overpaid, in respect of the use value of the overpayment
and/or interest?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><b>Question 4:</b></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">If the answer to question 1 is
in the negative, does the EU law principle of effectiveness require a member state
to disapply national law restrictions (such as sections 78 and 80 of the Value
Added Tax Act 1994) on any domestic claims or remedies that would otherwise be available
to the taxable person to vindicate the EU law right established in the Court of
Justice’s answer to the first three questions, or can the principle of
effectiveness be satisfied if the national court disapplies such restrictions
only in respect of one of these domestic claims or remedies?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">What other principles should
guide the national court in giving effect to this EU law right so as to accord
with the EU law principle of effectiveness?</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) (“CJEU” or “the court”) examined
the questions together, and reformulated them as asking “in essence, whether,
in a situation such as that at issue in the cases in the main proceedings, in
which an amount of VAT overpaid by reason of non-compliance with EU law has been
repaid to the taxpayer concerned, it is in accordance with EU law for national
law to provide for the payment of only ‘simple’ interest on that sum, or
whether EU law requires national law to provide for payment of ‘compound
interest’ as a counterpart for the value of the use of the overpaid sums and/or
the loss of the value of the use of the latter or for another method of reparation
which, in that latter case, the court is asked to specify”: (Case C-591/10)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C59110.html">[2012] STC 1714</a>, para 22. The court answered the question as follows at para 35:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“European Union law must be
interpreted as requiring that a taxable person who has overpaid value added tax
which was collected by the member state contrary to the requirements of European
Union legislation on value added tax has a right to reimbursement of the tax
collected in breach of European Union law and to the payment of interest on the
amount of the latter. It is for national law to determine, in compliance with
the principles of effectiveness and equivalence, whether the principal sum must
bear ‘simple interest’, ‘compound interest’ or another type of<i> </i>interest.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The High Court proceedings then resumed before Henderson J, who heard a
trial of all outstanding issues. In his judgment, he held that Littlewoods’
claims succeeded in full: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2014/868.html">[2014] EWHC 868 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2014/868.html">[2014] STC 1761</a>. In particular,
he held that only an award of compound interest would satisfy Littlewoods’
rights under EU law, that the exclusion of the claims by sections 78 and 80 of
the 1994 Act was therefore incompatible with EU law, and that those provisions
had to be disapplied so as to allow Littlewoods to pursue their claims.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both parties appealed. The Court of Appeal (Arden, Patten and Floyd LJJ)
upheld Henderson J’s conclusions on all issues, and dismissed both sides’
appeals: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/515.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 515</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/515.html">[2016] Ch 373</a>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both parties now appeal to this court. The first issue is raised by
Littlewoods’ cross-appeal, and is whether Vos J and the Court of Appeal were
correct in holding that Littlewoods’ claims are excluded by sections 78 and 80
of the 1994 Act, as a matter of English law and without reference to EU law. If
not, then it follows that Littlewoods are free to bring any common law claims
available to them without statutory impediment, and do not need to rely on EU
law in order to overcome a statutory bar.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The remainder of the issues are raised by HMRC’s appeal. The second
issue is whether, if Littlewoods’ claims are excluded by sections 78 and 80 of
the 1994 Act, that exclusion is contrary to EU law. A number of further issues
are raised in the appeal, but they only arise for decision if Littlewoods
succeed on either of the first two issues. In other words, if Littlewoods fail
on the first and second issues, then it follows that their claims are excluded
by statutory provisions which are not incompatible with EU law, and that their
claims must therefore be rejected.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>In considering the effect of sections 78 and 80 of the 1994 Act, it may
be helpful to begin with section 80. This was first enacted as section 24 of
the Finance Act 1989 and brought into force on 1 January 1990. Since its
consolidation in the 1994 Act it has undergone amendment on a number of
occasions. The version in force at the time when Littlewoods commenced the
present proceedings is, so far as relevant, in the terms set out below. Later
amendments are not relevant for present purposes:</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>In view of the three year limitation period laid down by section 80(4),
it is necessary to explain how Littlewoods were able to make claims between
2002 and 2004 for the recovery of overpaid tax going back to 1973. As
originally enacted, section 80 provided for a limitation period of six years
unless the undue tax had been paid by reason of a mistake, in which event a
claim could be made at any time within six years from the date on which the
claimant discovered the mistake or could with reasonable diligence have
discovered it. That limitation period was reduced to one of three years, as in
the version of section 80(4) set out above, by an amendment enacted by section
47 of the Finance Act 1997. The amendment was brought into force with
retrospective effect from the first announcement of the change on 18 July 1996.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The retrospective introduction of the reduced limitation period, without
any transitional arrangements for cases where a right to recovery of overpaid
tax already existed, was held by the CJEU to be incompatible with EU law: <i>Marks
&amp; Spencer plc v Customs and Excise Comrs</i> (Case C-62/00) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2002/C6200.html">[2003] QB 866</a>.
The House of Lords subsequently decided that the reduced limitation period had
to be disapplied in respect of rights which had accrued before it was brought
into force: <i>Fleming (trading as Bodycraft) v Revenue and Customs Comrs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/2.html">[2008] UKHL 2</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/2.html">[2008] 1 WLR 195</a>. It is on that basis that HMRC have repaid Littlewoods
the overpaid tax back to 1973. The position was addressed legislatively in
section 121 of the Finance Act 2008, which excluded the application of section
80(4) of the 1994 Act to claims in respect of amounts brought into account or paid
before 4 December 1996, provided the claim was made before 1 April 2009.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For present purposes, the most material provisions of section 80 are
subsections (3), (4) and (7). Section 80(3) provides HMRC with a statutory
defence to a claim under section 80 where reimbursing the taxpayer who made the
overpayment would unjustly enrich him. The possibility of unjust enrichment (in
a non-technical sense) arises because the taxpayer often passes on to his
customers the burden of the output tax for which he accounts to HMRC. Section
80A (as inserted by section 46(2) of the Finance Act 1997), and the Value Added
Tax Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2518), as amended, create a scheme under which the
defence is disapplied where reimbursement arrangements are made with the purpose
of ensuring that the payment to the taxpayer is used to reimburse the customers
who have borne the economic burden of the tax.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 80(4) lays down a limitation period for claims under the section
which, following the amendment effected by the Finance Act 1997, is shorter
than the period of six years, capable of extension where a mistake has been
made, which would apply to a common law claim in unjust enrichment under the
Limitation Act 1980. A statutory claim by the taxpayer must therefore be brought
within a shorter and more certain period of time. The evident aim is to protect
public finances against the risk of a liability to repay tax emerging more than
three years after the tax was received. That is consistent with the background
to the amendment: as Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe explained in the <i>Fleming </i>case
at para 36, it was prompted by developments in the case law of the CJEU which
exposed HMRC to the risk of claims for repayment of large amounts of output
tax, some of it going back for many years. As this court put it in <i>Investment
Trust Companies v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/29.html">[2017] UKSC 29</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/29.html">[2017] 2 WLR 1200</a>, para 88, the limitation period is designed to avoid the disruption of
public finances.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In section 80, Parliament has thus created a specific remedy for
taxpayers who have overpaid VAT, but has done so subject to limitations,
including those set out in subsections (3) and (4). Those limitations would
have no equivalent in a common law claim, and would therefore be defeated if it
were possible for the taxpayer, or his customers, to bring such a claim.
Parliament cannot have intended the special regime in section 80 to be capable
of circumvention in that way.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That is reflected in section 80(7), which provides that HMRC shall not
be liable to repay an amount paid to them by way of VAT on the ground that it
was not due, “except as provided by this section”. In the light of section
80(3) and (4), this court concluded in <i>Investment Trust Companies </i>that
section 80(7) should be construed as excluding non-statutory claims by
customers, as well as taxpayers (as was conceded), which might otherwise lie
against HMRC in circumstances falling within the scope of section 80. As the
court stated:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Parliament cannot sensibly be
taken to have intended, when it created this scheme for the reimbursement of
suppliers (with provision for them in turn to reimburse their customers),
subject to strict time limits, that it should exist concurrently with
non-statutory liabilities towards suppliers and their customers which were
potentially wider in scope and were subject to a longer and less certain
limitation period. Such an intention would be inconsistent with the rationale
of the statutory scheme.” (para 84)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Littlewoods take no issue with that conclusion. They made their claims
for the repayment of the tax under section 80, and they accept that no other
route to the recovery of the tax was open to them. But, they argue, section 80
does not deal with the question of interest, and has no bearing on their
present claims. Interest is addressed in the statutory scheme by section 78,
and that section, they argue, provides a statutory right to interest which is
of a residual character, and leaves common law claims unaffected.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>Section 78 of the 1994 Act was originally enacted as section 38A of the
Value Added Tax Act 1983, inserted by section 17 of the Finance Act 1991, which
received the Royal Assent on 25 July 1991. It was then consolidated in the 1994
Act together with an amendment (immaterial for present purposes) which had been

</span>As originally enacted, section 78(11) provided for a limitation period
of six years running from the date on which the claimant discovered HMRC’s error
or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it. Like the corresponding
provision in section 80, it was amended by the Finance Act 1997 so as to impose
a three year period, with retrospective effect, and with no transitional
provisions. In view of the incompatibility of that situation with EU law, HMRC
have paid Littlewoods interest under section 78, back to 1973, on the amount
repaid to them under section 80.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Littlewoods’ cross-appeal centres on the words in section 78(1) which we
have italicised (“if and to the extent that they would not be liable to do so
apart from this section”). They argue that those words should be given their
ordinary meaning. So construed, section 78 yields to any other liability to pay
interest. The purpose of the legislation, so they argue, is to create a
liability to pay interest where none would otherwise exist. However, following
the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Sempra Metals</i>, where HMRC have had
the use of money as a result of the payment of tax which was not due, it is
possible for the taxpayer to bring a claim for compound interest on the money
in question under the common law, on the ground of unjust enrichment. Since a
liability to meet such a claim is one which exists apart from section 78, it is
not excluded by section 78.</a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This argument has been consistently rejected by the courts, but for a
variety of different reasons. In <i>F J Chalke Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2009/952.html">[2009] EWHC 952 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2009/952.html">[2009] STC 2027</a>, Henderson J focused on the fact that section
80(7) excludes any common law liability to repay the overpaid VAT, and inferred
that it must also exclude any common law liability to pay interest: “the
exclusion in section 80(7) of any liability to repay overpaid VAT save as
provided for by section 80 necessarily prevents the recovery of any interest on
the overpaid VAT, except where section 78 or some other statutory provision
provides an entitlement to such interest” (para 74). The difficulty with that
reasoning, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in the present case (paras
37-42), is that it was held in <i>Sempra Metals </i>that a restitutionary claim
in respect of the use value of money is distinct from a restitutionary claim in
respect of the money itself: the right to recover interest was described as a
free-standing cause of action. On that basis, it would appear, at least on a
strict reading, that even if the cause of action for repayment of the overpaid
tax is swept away by section 80(7), that may not exclude a cause of action in
respect of the use value of the money.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, Vos J considered that sections 78 and 80 had to be
regarded as creating an integrated regime for repayments of overstated and
overpaid VAT, which should be read as a whole. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of
section 78(1) applied specifically to cases where repayments were due under
section 80. If, however, the critical words in section 78(1) covered common law
restitution claims, then the right to interest under section 78 would be
disapplied in every case where repayments were due under section 80. In those
circumstances, to construe the critical words as including common law
restitutionary claims would make a nonsense of the provision (para 60).</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal focused on the fact that the critical words in
section 78(1) concern liabilities to pay “interest”. In their view, it was a
strained use of language to describe a liability to make restitution for the
time value of money as a liability to pay interest, even if the relief was
calculated by reference to interest rates (para 45). There are two difficulties
with this reasoning. The first is that it is difficult to see any substantial
distinction between a liability to pay for the time value of money and a
liability to pay interest: interest is a measure of the time value (or use
value) of money. The second is that, if Littlewoods’ claim does not concern a
liability to pay interest, it is difficult to see how it can be affected by
section 78, which is solely concerned with interest.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Despite the attractive way in which Littlewoods’ argument was presented,
we agree with the courts below that it should be rejected. It is notable in the
first place that the scheme established by section 78 applies in circumstances
falling within paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1). Although section 78(1)
is not confined to circumstances in which a repayment is due under section 80,
such circumstances fall within its scope. The present case falls under paragraph
(a), which applies expressly where a person has accounted to HMRC for output
tax which was not due, “and, as a result, they are liable under section 80(2A)
to pay (or repay) an amount to him”. HMRC are only liable to pay interest on
the repayment under section 78, however, if the circumstances leading to the
repayment are “due to an error on the part of the Commissioners”. That
limitation strongly suggests that section 78 is intended to be exclusive of any
common law right to interest on the repayment. What would be the point of
limiting interest under section 78 to cases of official error, if interest was
generally available at common law regardless of whether any official error had
been made?</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, section 78(3) specifies the rate of interest payable by
reference to section 197 of the Finance Act 1996, which in turn enables the
rate to be set by regulations. Rates have been set by statutory instrument for
the whole lifetime of VAT back to 1 April 1973. The interest is calculated on a
simple rather than a compounded basis. The provision again suggests that
section 78 is intended to be exclusive of any common law right to interest,
which might be calculated at other rates and on a different basis.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, section 78(11) lays down a limitation period for claims under
the section which is shorter than the period of six years, with the potential
for an extension in the event of mistake, which would apply to a common law
claim in unjust enrichment under the Limitation Act 1980. Like the
corresponding provision in section 80, that shortened limitation period must be
intended to protect public finances from disruption.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In section 78, Parliament has thus created a specific right to interest
for taxpayers who have overpaid VAT, but has done so subject to limitations,
including those set out in subsections (1), (3) and (11). Those limitations are
a special feature of the statutory regime and would have no equivalent in a
common law claim. They would therefore be defeated if it were possible for the
taxpayer to bring a common law claim. Parliament cannot have intended the
special regime in section 78 to be capable of circumvention in that way. Unlike
section 80, however, section 78 contains no provision expressly excluding
alternative remedies. That does not prevent the exclusion of alternative
remedies by implication. As Littlewoods point out, however, the critical words
in subsection (1) acknowledge that there are other rights to interest which
must be given priority. Read literally, those words would apply to common law
rights to interest; but that reading, as we have explained, would render the
limitations in subsections (1), (3) and (11) effectively pointless. How, then,
are those words to be construed in the context of the provision as a whole?</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>At the time of when section 78 was enacted, interest was available under
the VAT legislation only in limited circumstances, discussed below. Interest
was also available under statute on a sum for which judgment was given in
proceedings for the recovery of a debt or damages: Senior Courts Act 1981,
section 35A (as inserted by section 15 of the Administration of Justice Act
1982). Under the common law, on the other hand, the general rule was that the
court had no power, in the absence of agreement, to award interest as damages for
the late payment of a debt: <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South
Eastern Railway Co </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1893/41.html">[1893] AC 429</a>. An exception to that general rule existed
where loss due to late payment constituted special damage within the
contemplation of the parties, under the second limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1854/J70.html">(1854) 9 Exch 341</a>: <i>President of India v La Pintada Cia Navigacion SA </i>[1985] AC
104. So far as restitutionary claims were concerned, it had been held that in
an action for money had and received only the net sum could be recovered: <i>Johnson

established by section 78 was more generous than the common law, as then

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this context, the aspect of the decision in <i>Sempra Metals</i>
which is important is that it was accepted for the first time that a claim
would lie at common law for the use value of money by which the defendant was
unjustly enriched, even if the money itself had been repaid, and that the
enrichment could normally be calculated by compounding interest over the period
of the enrichment. That decision was not contemplated by Parliament when it
enacted sections 78 and 80, many years earlier. If a claim based on the
principle established by that decision were held to be available to
Littlewoods, on the basis that it fell within the critical words in section
78(1) (“if and to the extent that they would not be liable to do so apart from
this section”), then it would equally be available in any other case where an
amount was paid under section 80. As counsel for Littlewoods accepted in
argument, section 78 would effectively become a dead letter. It follows that
the literal reading fatally compromises the statutory scheme created by
Parliament. It cannot therefore be the construction of the critical words which
Parliament intended.</a></p><a name="para37">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Is it possible to construe the critical words more narrowly than their
literal sense? What source or sources of a liability to pay interest can
Parliament have contemplated, which were to take priority over the liability
created by section 78? Given the background which we have explained, such
sources can only have been statutory. One such source is the power to award
interest following a decision on an appeal, originally enacted in section 40(4)
of the Finance Act 1972 and now contained in section 85A of the 1994 Act (as
inserted by paragraph 223 of Schedule 1 to the Transfer of Tribunal Functions
and Revenue and Customs Appeals Order 2009 (SI 2009/56)). Another is the power
to award interest where an appeal is settled, originally enacted in section 25
of the Finance Act 1985, and now contained in section 85 of the 1994 Act. A
third example is the power to award interest on an amount for which judgment is
given, under section 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The effect of the
critical words in section 78(1) is to give priority to provisions such as
these, and to prevent double recovery by the taxpayer.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>The reservation in section 78(1) (“if and to the extent that they would
not be liable to do so apart from this section”) must therefore be interpreted
as referring only to statutory liabilities. It is not a literal construction,
but a departure from a literal construction is justified where it is necessary
to enable the provision to have the effect which Parliament must have intended.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>Since the scheme created by section 78 is inconsistent with the
availability of concurrent common law claims to interest, it must therefore be
interpreted as impliedly excluding such claims. The reservation set out in
section 78(1) must therefore be construed as referring only to statutory
liabilities to pay interest. So construed, section 78 impliedly excludes the
claims made by Littlewoods, as a matter of English law, and without reference

</span>As we shall seek to demonstrate, the central question is whether the
CJEU has ruled that HMRC must reimburse in full the use value of the money
which over an exceptionally long period of time Littlewoods has paid by
mistake. In order to answer that question, it is necessary to set out the
central paragraphs of the CJEU’s judgment which support the ruling in that

the right to a refund of charges levied in a member state in breach of rules of
EU law is a consequence and complement of the rights conferred on individuals
by provisions of EU law as interpreted by the Court. In that regard, the CJEU
referred to <i>Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio </i>(Case

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court has also held
that, where a member state has levied charges in breach of the rules of
Community law, individuals are entitled to reimbursement not only of the tax
unduly levied but also of the amounts paid to that state or retained by it which
relate directly to that tax. That also includes losses constituted by the
unavailability of sums of money as a result of a tax being levied prematurely (<i>Metallgesellschaft</i>,
paras 87 to 89, and <i>Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation</i>, para
205).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows from that
case law that the principle of the obligation of member states to repay with
interest amounts of tax levied in breach of EU law follows from that law.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of EU
legislation, it is for the internal legal order of each member state to lay
down the conditions in which such interest must be paid, particularly the rate
of that interest and its method of calculation (simple or ‘compound’ interest).
Those conditions must comply with the principles of equivalence and
effectiveness; that is to say that they must not be less favourable than those
concerning similar claims based on provisions of national law or arranged in
such a way as to make the exercise of rights conferred by the EU legal order
practically impossible (see, to that effect, [<i>San Giorgio</i>, para 12; <i>Weber’s

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, according to
consistent case law, the principle of effectiveness prohibits a member state
from rendering the exercise of rights conferred by the EU legal order

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case that
principle requires that the national rules referring in particular to the
calculation of interest which may be due should not lead to depriving the
taxpayer of an adequate indemnity for the loss occasioned through the undue
payment of VAT.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for the referring
court to determine whether that is so in the case at issue in the main
proceedings, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. In that regard
it should be noted that it is apparent from the order for reference that, under
the provisions of section 78 of the VATA 1994, the Commissioners paid
Littlewoods interest on the VAT levied in breach of EU law. Pursuant to those
provisions, Littlewoods received payment of simple interest, in accordance with
the said provisions, in an amount of GBP 268,159,135, corresponding to interest
due over about 30 years, which amount exceeds by more than 23% that of the
principal sum, which amounts to GBP 204,774,763.”</p>

</span>Before both Henderson J and the Court of Appeal Littlewoods succeeded in
their assertion that EU law, as laid down in this judgment of the CJEU, gave
them a right to a full reimbursement of their loss caused by their mistaken
payment of VAT. At the trial before Henderson J, Littlewoods led evidence from
Professor John Kay that reimbursement of the use value of money over long
periods of time required the payment of compound interest and that the simple
interest, which HMRC had paid, reimbursed only about 24% of Littlewoods’ loss,
which amounted to approximately £1.2 billion. Littlewoods argued that simple
interest therefore did not give an adequate indemnity or reimbursement of
Littlewoods’ loss as EU law required.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to understand the debate in this appeal and the reasons for our
conclusions, it is useful to summarise the relevant parts of Henderson J’s
impressive judgment. Henderson J upheld Littlewoods’ submission essentially
because he interpreted the reference to “an adequate indemnity” in para 29 of
the CJEU’s judgment as a right to reimbursement of the losses representing the
time value of unlawfully levied tax which the member state retained. Those
losses resulted from the unavailability to the taxpaying company of the sums of
money which it had erroneously paid as tax. The CJEU had held in para 25 that
those losses fell within the sums retained by the state “which relate directly
to that tax”. The right to interest to make good those losses had been
recognised as a right conferred by EU law (para 260). He found support for that
interpretation of the CJEU judgment in two later judgments of the CJEU. In the
first, <i>British Sugar plc v Rural Payments Agency </i>(Case C<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">‑</span>147/10) heard with <i>Zuckerfabrik
Jülich AG v Hauptzollamt Aache </i>(Case C-133/10) and <i>Société</i> <i>Tereos
v Directeur général des douanes et droits indirects</i> (Case C-234/10)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C11310_O.html">EU:C:2012:591</a>, the Fourth Chamber of the CJEU held that interest was payable by
the national body, the Rural Payments Agency, on invalidly levied sugar levies
even if it could not recover interest on those levies from the EU institution,
to which it had paid them, and it had not been enriched by the receipt of the
levies. This, Henderson J held, emphasised the potency of the right to interest
in EU law, which the CJEU appeared to regard as conceptually indistinguishable
from the right to repayment of the unlawfully levied tax (para 263).</p>

C-565/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C56511.html">[2013] STC 1321</a>, concerned a rule of Romanian law which provided that
interest on unlawfully levied tax, which had to be repaid, ran only from the
date of the claim for repayment and not from the date when the tax had been
paid. The CJEU held (paras 26-28) that the temporal limitation on the accrual
of interest did not meet the requirements of the court’s ruling in <i>Littlewoods</i>
that the calculation of interest should not lead to depriving the taxpayer of
adequate compensation for the loss sustained through the undue payment of tax.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Henderson J expressed the view that the case advanced by Littlewoods in
their detailed written observations to the CJEU assisted in interpreting the
judgment of the court. Littlewoods had argued not that EU law always required
the payment of compound interest on overpaid tax but that interest reflecting
the use value of the money received should always be paid in order to satisfy
the principle of effectiveness (para 273). Littlewoods had founded on the
decision of the CJEU in <i>Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire
Health Authority (Teaching) (No 2) </i>(Case C-271/91)<i> </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1993/C27191.html">[1994] QB 126</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1993/C27191.html">[1993] ECR I-4367</a>. That case concerned the measure of compensation in a
successful claim for sex discrimination arising from the health authority’s
provision of an earlier compulsory retirement age for women compared with that
for men in the same employment. The health authority paid her the maximum sum
of £6,250 which was then permitted as compensation under the Sex Discrimination
Act 1975 and the House of Lords referred to the CJEU the question whether it
was essential to the due implementation of article 6 of Council Directive
76/207/EEC (“the Equal Treatment Directive”) that her compensation should not
be less than the loss she had sustained and that it should include an award of
interest. The CJEU held (paras 22-26) that the object of article 6 of the Equal
Treatment Directive was to arrive at real equality of opportunity; when
financial compensation was the measure adopted to achieve that objective, “it
must be adequate, in that it must enable the loss and damage actually sustained
as a result of the discriminatory dismissal to be made good in full in
accordance with applicable national rules”. In relation to the award of
interest, the CJEU held (para 31) that full compensation could not leave out of
account factors, such as the effluxion of time, which reduce its value; an
award of interest in accordance with applicable national rules was therefore an
essential component of compensation for the purpose of restoring real equality
of treatment. Henderson J considered that the references in that case to
“adequate” compensation, with the connotation of “full compensation”, involved
similar language to the phrase “an adequate indemnity” in para 29 of the CJEU’s
judgment in this case (para 279).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Henderson J interpreted the CJEU’s judgment in the present case as
having held that the right to interest on unduly levied tax is a right
conferred by EU law which ranked equally with the right to repayment of the
unlawful tax itself. That was the substance of the EU right which the CJEU
established in para 26 of its judgment (para 287). The principle of
effectiveness, which sets minimum standards for the enforcement and protection
of EU rights in national law, was a secondary or adjectival principle, which
did not define the substance of those rights and could not whittle down those
rights (para 286). He looked at English dictionary definitions of “adequate”
and “indemnity” (para 292) in support of his conclusions, and faced up to the
“puzzling questions” (a) why the CJEU had not given clearer guidance that
compound interest was required and (b) why the CJEU in the final sentence of para
30 had referred to the sums which HMRC had paid (para 296). He accepted that he
did not have a satisfactory answer to the latter question (para 299).</a></p><a name="para48">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He stated his conclusion on this matter in these terms (para 302):</a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In sum, my overall conclusion on
the difficult question of the meaning of the ‘adequate indemnity’ test in para
29 of the [CJEU’s] judgment is that it requires payment of an amount of
interest which is broadly commensurate with the loss suffered by the taxpayer
of the use value of the tax which he has overpaid, running from the date of
payment until the date of repayment.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">On that basis, the simple interest which HMRC had paid
could not have provided Littlewoods with an adequate indemnity for their loss
(para 310).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal, like the judge, considered that it was logically
necessary to identify the content of the right to interest, which the CJEU had
recognised in this case, before answering the question whether the UK’s rules
in section 78 of VATA gave effect to the right in accordance with the principle
of effectiveness. The Court focussed on para 25 of the CJEU’s judgment,
treating the word “reimbursement” as very important (para 94). That right to
reimbursement included losses constituted by the unavailability of money (para
96). This approach was supported by the CJEU’s judgment in <i>Irimie</i>
(above). Para 27 of the CJEU’s judgment, on which HMRC had relied in their
submissions, did not modify the content of that right. The Court of Appeal
therefore rejected HMRC’s submission that “an adequate indemnity” in para 29 of
the CJEU’s judgment only required that a member state provide for “interest in
some recognisable form” and stated that the test was that the taxpayer was
“entitled to reimbursement of the losses constituted by the unavailability of
sums of money as a result of a tax being levied” (para 107).</a></p><a name="para50">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We have reached a different but nonetheless clear view as to the meaning
of the CJEU’s judgment in this case. In our view the phrase “an adequate indemnity”
in para 29 of the judgment, when construed in the context of the wider
judgment, and in particular the paragraphs which we have quoted in para 43
above, bears a broader meaning than that which Henderson J and the Court of
Appeal favoured, and suggests that the CJEU has given member state courts a discretion
to provide reasonable redress in the form of interest in addition to the
mandatory repayment of any wrongly levied tax, interest and penalties. We have
three reasons for this view. First, the structure of the CJEU’s judgment itself
and its choice of words support this conclusion. Secondly, the practice of
member states in awarding interest on wrongly levied tax provides the context
of the CJEU’s judgment and suggests that the court was not being as radical as
the courts below have held. Thirdly, prior and subsequent case law of the CJEU
is consistent with this interpretation. We examine each in turn.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, the structure of the relevant passage in the CJEU’s judgment can
be analysed in three parts. The first part is paras 24 to 26 in which the CJEU
sets out the prior case law which established the right to a refund of charges
levied by a member state in breach of EU law, and the extension of that right
by <i>Metallgesellschaft </i>(above) and <i>Test Claimants in the FII Group
Litigation</i> <i>v Inland Revenue Comrs </i>(Case C-446/04) (Note) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C44604.html">[2012] 2 AC 436</a> to include other amounts retained by the member state, including
compensation for the unavailability of sums of money paid as tax. We discuss
those cases when we set out the third reason below. The conclusion which the
CJEU reaches from the case law set out in paras 24 and 25 is stated in para 26
and merits repetition:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It follows from that case law
that the principle of the obligation of member states to repay with interest
amounts of tax levied in breach of EU law follows from that law.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">There is therefore a general entitlement to interest on
tax levied in breach of EU law.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the courts below, emphasis was placed on the CJEU’s use of the word
“reimbursement” in para 25 when it speaks of the reimbursement of losses
constituted by the unavailability of money. We do not attach such significance to
a single word, considered in isolation. It is necessary to consider para 25 in
the context of the judgment as a whole. In our view, consistently with the
conclusion expressed in para 26, reimbursement of loss means no more than
recompense or compensation, which is achieved through the payment of some form
of interest. In relation to the principal sums, whether of tax, interest or penalties
levied by the member state, the compensation would be full compensation in
order to achieve restitution of those principal sums. But interest is a means
of compensating a person for being kept out of his money. The measure of such
compensation is not as straightforward as the calculation of the principal sums
which must be repaid. The Court does not specify the level of the compensation
for the unavailability of money which that interest is to provide. Instead, the
CJEU confirms in this first part that there is an EU principle that a member state
must repay with interest charges which it has levied in breach of EU law. It is
in the second part that the CJEU lays down what EU law requires member states
to provide by way of interest.</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the second part, which is paras 27 to 29, the CJEU restates the
principle that it is for the internal order of each member state to lay down
the conditions in which such interest must be paid. The member state is given a
discretion both as to the interest rate and also as to the method of
calculation, in particular whether it is simple or compound interest. That
discretion is qualified by the established EU law principles of equivalence and
effectiveness. The former principle, which in this context requires that the
interest to be awarded must not be less favourable than that which would be
paid on similar claims for the repayment of unduly levied tax under domestic
law, is not in issue. The latter principle, the principle of effectiveness, is
in issue as it gives the context of the phrase “an adequate indemnity” in para
29. We discuss the principle further when we set out the third reason below.
Paragraph 29 of the judgment describes what the principle of effectiveness
requires. It is that the national rules on the calculation of interest should
not deprive the taxpayer of “an adequate indemnity” for the loss occasioned
through the undue payment of the tax.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The phrase, “an adequate indemnity” has a less definitive meaning than
“full reimbursement”. The French text of the judgment speaks of “une
indemnisation adéquate” and the German text refers to “eine angemessene
Entschädigung”. In both languages, as in English, the words chosen can support
a range of meanings, including the meaning of “adequate compensation” or
“reasonable redress”, which are not tied into the idea of full compensation for
the time value of money.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In using the principle of effectiveness to require the existence of “an
adequate indemnity” but not expressing a definitive view on the adequacy of
simple interest, the CJEU was less categorical than Advocate General Trstenjak,
who opined (paras 33 and 34) that the payment of simple interest clearly
complied with that principle and that that principle would be breached only if
the interest rate were so low as to deprive the claim of substance. In support
of that view she recited (para 37) the amounts of principal and interest which
HMRC had paid and recorded that the latter exceeded the former by over 25%. But
it would be wrong to overstate the extent of the CJEU’s departure from the
Advocate General’s approach. In what we see as the third part of the relevant
passage in its judgment (para 30) the CJEU, after stating that it was for the
referring court to decide whether the national rules for the calculation of
interest would deprive the taxpayer of “an adequate indemnity”, recorded what
HMRC had already paid and repeated the comparison which the Advocate General
had made between the amount of principal and the amount of interest on that
principal.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What the CJEU said in para 30 suggests that the payment of a substantial
amount of interest in a claim for repayment, which, unusually, stretches back
over decades, can constitute reasonable redress. This is consistent with the
application of the principle of effectiveness, namely that the rules do not
render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights
conferred by EU law: having recognised a right to interest (para 26), the CJEU
points out in para 30 that the taxpayer has already received interest amounting
to more than 125% of the principal sum. This approach is also readily
understandable in a context in which the CJEU, in the interests of legal
certainty, has upheld the validity of national limitation periods of relatively
short duration which restrict the ability of taxpayers to recover unduly paid
tax: for example <i>Rewe-Zentralfinanz eG v Landwirtschaftskammer für das
Saarland </i>(Case C-33/76) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1976/R3376.html">[1976] ECR 1989</a>, para 5; <i>Palmisani v Instituto

there is no general principle of EU law that there must be full reimbursement
of the use value of money.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If, as Henderson J and the Court of Appeal have held, the CJEU, in the
paras leading up to para 26, had established a principle that the interest
awarded should achieve a full or almost full reimbursement of loss, there is no
satisfactory explanation for what the CJEU then said in para 30. As we have
said, Henderson J recognised this difficulty and described it as a “puzzling”
question to which he had “no satisfactory answer” (paras 296 and 299). He
accepted that the CJEU sometimes makes “an observation about the facts which
gives a strong indication of what it thinks the answer probably should be”,
while leaving it to the referring court to provide the answer. But, as he
interpreted the words “an adequate indemnity” as requiring an amount of
interest broadly commensurate with the loss suffered by the taxpayer of the use
value of the tax, he found it incredible that the CJEU would have thought that
simple interest over 30 years could achieve that result. Differing as we do from
Henderson J and the Court of Appeal in our interpretation of the CJEU’s
judgment, we have no difficulty in seeing para 30 as fitting into the structure
of that judgment: having set out a criterion of reasonable redress which was to
cover the aggregate of principal and interest, the CJEU in quoting the figures,
which had persuaded the Advocate General to assert that simple interest
sufficed, has given a strong indication of its view, when handling the matter
back to the referring court to apply a broad judgment.</a></p><a name="para58">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In summary, we interpret the CJEU’s judgment as (i) requiring the
repayment of tax with interest, without specifying the form of that interest
(ii) stating that the principle of effectiveness requires that the calculation
of that interest, together with the repayment of the principal sum, should
amount to reasonable redress for the taxpayer’s loss, and (iii) suggesting that
the referring court might consider that interest which is over 125% of the
amount of the principal sum might be such reasonable redress.</a></p><a name="para59">

</span>Turning to the wider context of member state practice, the United
Kingdom Government in its written observations to the CJEU examined the legislation
in 13 other member states (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden). In all
but one (Sweden) simple interest is payable both on the recovery by taxpayers
of taxes which were unduly paid and on the recovery by the tax authorities of
taxes paid late. Thus, there was and is a widespread practice within the member
states of the EU which is the same as that in the United Kingdom. In this
context, if the CJEU were seeking to outlaw this practice, we would have
expected clear words to that effect. They are absent.</a></p><a name="para60">

that, in the absence of EU rules governing the matter, the payment of interest
on such sums was an ancillary problem to be settled in national law, whether it
concerned the date from which interest was payable, the rate of interest or the
method of calculation: for example <i>Société Roquette Frères</i> <i>v

that there was a right in EU law to obtain interest accrued on the advance
payment of tax in breach of EU law for the period between the illegal advance
payment and the date on which the tax became payable under EU law. In that
case, because the purported but illegal liability to pay advance corporation
tax had later been replaced by a valid obligation to pay corporation tax, the
taxpayer had no claim for the tax itself and claimed merely for interest on the
premature payment of the tax. The CJEU reiterated its case law that it was for
the national courts to settle ancillary questions such as the payment of interest
(para 86) but nonetheless recognised as part of EU law a claim for interest,

article 52 of the Treaty.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In support of this view the CJEU referred (para 94) to <i>Marshall</i>
(above) which we discuss further in para 65 below.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Test Claimants in the FII Litigation </i>(above) the CJEU
confirmed this approach, holding in para 205 that</a></p><a name="para64">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“where a member state has levied
charges in breach of the rules of Community law, individuals are entitled to
reimbursement not only of the tax unduly levied but also of the amounts paid to
that state or retained by it which relate directly to that tax. As the court
held in paras 87 and 88 of <i>Metallgesellschaft</i>, that also includes losses
constituted by the unavailability of sums of money as a result of a tax being
levied prematurely.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">While the CJEU spoke in this passage about the
“reimbursement” of losses constituted by the unavailability of sums of money
which gave rise to an entitlement to claim interest, it made no statement as to
the rate or method of calculation of that interest, by which the use value of
money might be compensated. It is unsurprising, therefore, that the CJEU in
para 26 of its judgment in the present case deduced from the case law a general
principle that the repayment of tax levied in breach of EU law had also to
provide for the payment of interest, without specifying further the content of
that right to interest.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU in the present case did not refer in its judgment to <i>Marshall
</i>(above). But that case was cited to the court in argument and, as we have
said, featured in the reasoning of the court in <i>Metallgesellschaft</i>. We
have discussed the case of <i>Marshall</i> in para 47 above. In our view, the
case is clearly to be distinguished from the present case because it was
concerned with ascertaining the principal sum which should be paid to the
claimant to remove the discriminatory treatment which she had suffered and to
achieve equality of opportunity. The use by the CJEU in that case of the phrase
“adequate” to describe the making good in full of the loss sustained as a
result of her dismissal makes good sense in that context. But there are three
reasons why we do not infer that the CJEU in the present case intended the phrase
“an adequate indemnity” to have the same meaning in the context of interest.
First, in <i>Marshall</i> the CJEU applied the principle of effectiveness in a
contextual manner; as in the earlier case of <i>von Colson v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen</i>
(Case 14/83) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1984/R1483.html">[1984] ECR 1891</a>, the court had regard to the purpose of the Equal
Treatment Directive in giving content to the principle in relation to the
principal sum to be paid as compensation. Secondly, the court in <i>Marshall</i>
addressed the claim for interest separately (para 31), holding that full
compensation included taking account of the effluxion of time which might
diminish the value of the award and that therefore an award of interest in
accordance with the applicable national rules was an essential component of the
compensation. Taking into account the diminution in value of a sum of money
through the passage of time is not the same as compensation in full for the use
value of money. Thirdly, as Henderson J recognised (para 282), the CJEU may
have adopted the phrase “an adequate indemnity” from para 32 of the written observations
submitted by the European Commission in support of the sufficiency of simple
interest in which it spoke of such interest providing “adequate restitution or
compensation”. The Advocate General summarised the Commission’s position by
referring to this paragraph in her opinion (para 11)<i>. Marshall </i>therefore
is of no assistance.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to the subsequent case law, we encounter the CJEU formulating
the law in substantially the same way as it did in this case. Thus, in <i>Zuckerfabrick
Jülich AG v Hauptzollamt Aachen, British Sugar plc v Rural Payments Agency and Société
Tereos v Directeur général des douanes et droits indirects</i> (Joined Cases
C-113/10, C-147/10 and C-234/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C11310_O.html">EU:C:2012:591</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C11310_O.html">[2012] All ER (D) 174</a> the CJEU
in paras 65 and 66 repeated the reasoning in paras 25 and 26 in the judgment in
this case and concluded (para 69) that individuals who were entitled to
reimbursement of sums paid as production levies under invalid EU legislation
were also entitled to interest on those sums. The member state was obliged to
pay interest even though it could not recover the corresponding interest from
the EU institution to which it had paid the invalid levies. But the CJEU did
not rule on the method of calculating that interest.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Irimie</i> (above) the CJEU ruled that a system, which limited the
interest accruing on tax unduly levied to that which accrued from the day
following the claim for repayment, deprived the taxpayer of adequate
compensation for her loss contrary to the principle of effectiveness (paras
26-27) and was therefore in breach of EU law (para 29). It held (para 28):</a></p><a name="para67">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That loss depends, inter alia, on
the duration of the unavailability of the sum unduly levied in breach of
European Union law and thus occurs, in principle, during the period between the
date of the undue payment of the tax at issue and the date of repayment
thereof.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In formulating its reasoning, the CJEU (at paras 20-23)
again followed the pattern in its judgment in this case in paras 24-27. In
summary, the CJEU confirmed that the right to repayment of unduly levied tax
was accompanied by a right to interest on that tax from the date of payment
until the date of repayment but it did not suggest that EU law required either
the rate or the method of calculation of the interest payable to achieve full
reimbursement of the use value of money during that period.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Wortmann KG Internationale Schuhproduktionen v Hauptzollamt
Bielefeld</i> (Case C-365/15) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C36515.html">EU:C:2017:19</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C36515.html">[2017] All ER (D) 55</a> the CJEU was
concerned with a claim for the repayment of import duties after EU legislation
imposing an antidumping duty was annulled. The court addressed the question
whether the relevant EU legislation establishing the Community Customs Code
must be interpreted as meaning that national law, having regard to the
principle of effectiveness, must provide for the payment of interest on the
reimbursed import duties from the date of payment until their repayment, even
in cases where no claim for reimbursement had been made in the national court.
Advocate General Campos Sánchez-Bordona, in proposing that the CJEU give a
positive answer to the question, relied on the court’s ruling in <i>Irimie </i>which,
he suggested (paras 69-70), was based on reasoning that the taxpayer was not to
be deprived of compensation “commensurate with the loss suffered”. But the CJEU
in its judgment did not adopt any such principle but merely repeated its case
law that parties who had paid taxes levied by a member state pursuant to an EU
regulation which had been declared invalid or annulled by the CJEU had the
right in principle to obtain not only the repayment of the amounts levied but
also interest on those amounts (paras 37-38). Again, no ruling or comment was
made as to the scope of a member state’s discretion in fixing the rate or the
method of calculation of interest.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We are satisfied therefore that there is nothing in the prior or
subsequent case law of the CJEU which militates against our interpretation of
its judgment in this case. Consistently with the views expressed by the European
Commission and the member state governments which submitted arguments to the
court in this case, the CJEU (para 34) has not required the payment of more
than simple interest if the national legal order treats that as reasonable
redress for the unavailability of the money and no issue of equivalence arises.
The CJEU’s reliance on the principles of effectiveness and equivalence is
wholly consistent with its jurisprudence that the questions of the rate and
method of calculation of interest are matters for the internal legal order of a
member state.</a></p><a name="para69">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our view, there is no requirement in the CJEU’s jurisprudence that
the value which the member state, by the award of interest, places on the use
of money should make good in full the loss which a taxpayer has suffered by
being kept out of his money. We are satisfied that Henderson J and the Court of
Appeal erred in reading too much into the phrase “an adequate indemnity” and
failed to give sufficient weight to its context in the relevant passage of the
CJEU’s judgment, including para 30 which they could not satisfactorily explain.</a></p><a name="para70">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We are satisfied that the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the CJEU in
this case, which addresses directly the issue which will determine this case,
is clear when read as a whole. The Grand Chamber has specifically addressed the
issue of whether simple or compound interest is required, in a reference made
in these very proceedings. It has given such guidance as it considered
appropriate. It has ruled that “it is for national law to determine, in
compliance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence, whether the
principal sum must bear ‘simple interest’, ‘compound interest’ or another type
of<i> </i>interest.” Here, national law provides for simple interest. No issue
of equivalence arises. So far as effectiveness is concerned, the Grand Chamber
has held that it is for the national court to determine whether the national
rules would deprive the taxpayer of an adequate indemnity for the loss caused
by the undue payment of VAT. In that regard, it has said that it should be
noted that the interest already paid exceeds the principal amount due by more
than 23%. It is now the duty of this court to apply that guidance. There is no
basis for a further reference to the CJEU.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Consistently with a widespread practice among member states of the EU,
the United Kingdom has treated the award of simple interest as an appropriate
remedy for being held out of money over time whether the claimant is HMRC, when
a taxpayer fails to pay his tax in a timely manner, or the claimant is the
taxpayer, when tax has been unduly levied.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Littlewoods have already recovered overpaid tax, and interest on that
amount, going back several decades. The size of that recovery reflects a
combination of circumstances which could not have occurred in most of the other
EU member states: the retroactive nature of a major development of the common
law by the courts, so as to allow for the first time the recovery of money paid
under a mistake in law, and the inability of the legislature to respond to that
development, under EU law, by retroactively altering the law of limitation so as
to protect public finances. The resultant payment of interest cannot
realistically be regarded as having deprived Littlewoods of an adequate indemnity,
in the sense in which that expression should be interpreted.</a></p><a name="para73">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We would dismiss Littlewoods’ cross-appeal on issue 1 and allow HMRC’s
appeal on issue 2. We would invite the parties, in the absence of agreement, to
lodge written submissions on the appropriate form of order to be made in this
case within 21 days of the handing down of this judgment.</a></p><a name="para74">
