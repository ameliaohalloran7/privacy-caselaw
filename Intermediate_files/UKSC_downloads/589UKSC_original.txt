<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is litigation on a large scale. Between May 2005 and February 2009,
Mr Mukhtar Ablyazov was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the claimant,
a bank incorporated in Kazakhstan. It is alleged that during this period, he
embezzled some US$6 billion of the Bank’s funds. In February 2009, the Bank was
nationalised and Mr Ablyazov was removed from office. He fled to England, where
he ultimately obtained asylum. In August 2009, the Bank began proceedings
against him in the Commercial Court, alleging misappropriation of its funds.
Other proceedings followed, in the Commercial Court and the Chancery Division. Mr
Ablyazov was ultimately the defendant in eleven actions brought by the Bank
against him, either alone or in conjunction with alleged associates.</a></p><a name="para1">

</span>At the outset of the litigation, the Bank obtained a disclosure order
requiring Mr Ablyazov to identify and disclose the whereabouts of his assets
and a worldwide freezing order preventing him from dealing with them.
Subsequently, in August 2010, the High Court appointed receivers over all of Mr
Ablyazov’s assets. Later that year, the Bank obtained a number of search and
disclosure orders. These yielded a haul of documents revealing a large number
of undisclosed assets and a network of undisclosed companies through which Mr
Ablyazov had sought to put them out of the reach of the Bank.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2011, the Bank applied for an order committing Mr Ablyazov for
contempt of court. Teare J gave judgment on that application on 16 February
2012. He held that Mr Ablyazov had failed to disclose his assets in breach of
the disclosure order, that he had disposed of certain of them in breach of the
freezing order and the receivership order, and that he had given false evidence
and forged documents in an attempt to cover his tracks. Teare J sentenced him
to 22 months imprisonment. However, by the time that the judgment was handed
down, the bird had flown. Mr Ablyazov fled the country on receipt of the
judge’s draft judgment. He spent some time in prison in France pending the
resolution of an application by Russia for his extradition, which ultimately
failed. His present whereabouts are unknown. On 29 February 2012, Teare J
ordered that Mr Ablyazov’s defences in the Commercial Court actions should be
struck out unless he gave full disclosure of his assets and surrendered himself
to the tipstaff. He did neither of these things, and default judgments were
subsequently obtained against him in four of the actions for sums exceeding US$4.6
billion and in a fifth for damages to be assessed. Very little has been
recovered.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present proceedings were commenced in July 2015. The defendants are
Mr Ablyazov and his son-in-law Mr Khrapunov, who is domiciled in Switzerland.
Mr Ablyazov has taken no part in these proceedings, and the present appeal is
concerned only with the position of Mr Khrapunov. The Bank’s case against him
is that he has at all times been aware of the freezing order and the
receivership order, and that in about 2009 he entered into a combination or
understanding with Mr Ablyazov to assist him in dissipating and concealing his
assets. For present purposes, it may be assumed that they entered into it in
England where Mr Ablyazov was then living. Teare J found that there was
sufficient evidence to that effect, and the point has not been contested before
us. It is alleged that both before and after Mr Ablyazov’s flight abroad Mr
Khrapunov actively participated in the agreed scheme, both on Mr Ablyazov’s
instructions and from time to time on his own initiative. He is said to have
been instrumental in extensive dealings in the assets of Swiss, Belizean and
Russian companies controlled by Mr Ablyazov and in laying a trail of false
documents to conceal what had become of them. This is relied upon as
constituting the tort of conspiracy to cause financial loss to the Bank by
unlawful means, namely serial breaches of the freezing order and the
receivership order.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present appeal arises out of an application by Mr Khrapunov
contesting the jurisdiction of the English court. The application is made on two
grounds. The first is that there is no such tort as the Bank asserts, because
contempt of court cannot constitute unlawful means for the purpose of the tort
of conspiracy. This, Mr Samek QC submits on his behalf, is because means are
unlawful for this purpose only if they would be actionable at the suit of the claimant
apart from any combination. Contempt of court, he submits, is not actionable as
such. There is therefore no good arguable case on which to found jurisdiction.
The second ground is that, Mr Khrapunov being domiciled in Switzerland, there
is no jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention unless the claim falls within
the special jurisdiction conferred by article 5(3) on the courts of “the place
where the harmful event occurred”. The only event said to have happened in
England is the conspiratorial agreement. Mr Khrapunov contends that the event
that was harmful was not the conspiratorial agreement but the acts done
pursuant to it. They were done outside England.</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="ParaHeading">The cause of action</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conspiracy is one of a group of torts which tend to be loosely lumped
together as “economic torts”, the others being intimidation, procuring a breach
of contract and unlawful interference with economic and other interests
(sometimes called the “intentional harm” tort). Along with tortious
misrepresentation (fraudulent or negligent), passing off, slander of title and
infringement of intellectual property rights, the economic torts are a major
exception to the general rule that there is no duty in tort to avoid causing a
purely economic loss unless it is parasitic upon some injury to person or
property. The reason for the general rule is that, contract apart, common law
duties to avoid causing pure economic loss tend to cut across the ordinary
incidents of competitive business, one of which is that one man’s gain may be
another man’s loss. The successful pursuit of commercial self-interest
necessarily entails the risk of damaging the commercial interests of others.
Identifying the point at which it transgresses legitimate bounds is therefore a
task of exceptional delicacy. The elements of the four established economic
torts are carefully defined so as to avoid trespassing on legitimate business
activities or imposing any wider liability than can be justified in principle. Some
of the elements of the torts, notably intention and unlawful means are common
to more than one of them. But it is dangerous to assume that they have the same
content in each context. In <i>OBG Ltd v Allan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/21.html">[2008] AC 1</a>, Lord Hoffmann
drew attention to some of the confusions and category errors which have
resulted from attempts by judges and scholars to formulate a unified theory on
which these causes of action can be explained. Lord Hoffmann was not directly
concerned with the tort of conspiracy, but of all the economic torts it is the
one whose boundaries are perhaps the hardest to define in principled terms.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The modern tort of conspiracy was developed in the late 19th and early 20th
century, as a device for imposing civil liability on the organisers of strikes
and other industrial action, once the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act
1875 had provided that combinations in furtherance of trade disputes should no
longer be indictable as crimes. It is an anomalous tort because it may make
actionable acts which would be lawful apart from the element of combination.
The ostensible rationale, that acts done in combination are inherently more
coercive than those done by a single actor, has not always been found
persuasive, least of all when the single actor may be a powerful corporation.
There is much to be said for the view expressed by Lord Walker in <i>Revenue
and Customs Comrs v Total Network SL</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/19.html">[2008] 1 AC 1174</a>, para 78, that an
unarticulated factor in the development of the tort was the conviction of late
Victorian judges that large-scale collective action in the political and
economic sphere by those outside the traditional governing class was a
potential threat to the constitution and the framework of society. Nonetheless,
the tort of conspiracy has an established place in the law of tort and its essential
elements have been clarified by a series of modern decisions of high authority,
most of them in contexts far removed from the modern tort’s origin in the law
relating to industrial disputes.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has been recognised since the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Quinn
v Leathem</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1901/40.html">[1901] AC 495</a> that the tort takes two forms: (i) conspiracy to
injure, where the overt acts done pursuant to the conspiracy may be lawful but
the predominant purpose is to injure the claimant; and (ii) conspiracy to do by
unlawful means an act which may be lawful in itself, albeit that injury to the
claimant is not the predominant purpose. In <i>Lonrho Plc v Fayed</i> [1992] 1
AC 448, Lord Bridge, with whom the rest of the Appellate Committee agreed,
reviewed the earlier authorities and summarised the position as follows, at pp
465-466:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where conspirators act with the
predominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff and in fact inflict damage on
him, but do nothing which would have been actionable if done by an individual
acting alone, it is in the fact of their concerted action for that illegitimate
purpose that the law, however anomalous it may now seem, finds a sufficient
ground to condemn their action as illegal and tortious. But when conspirators
intentionally injure the plaintiff and use unlawful means to do so, it is no
defence for them to show that their primary purpose was to further or protect
their own interests; it is sufficient to make their action tortious that the
means used were unlawful.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">We shall call these two forms of conspiracy a “lawful
means” and an “unlawful means” conspiracy respectively. The terminology is not
exact, because a cause of action in conspiracy may be based on a predominant
intention to injure the claimant whether the means are lawful or unlawful. But
it seems to us to be more satisfactory than using terms which appear to
distinguish between “conspiracies to injure” and other conspiracies. As we
shall show, all actionable conspiracies are conspiracies to injure, although
the intent required may take a variety of different forms.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conspiracy is both a crime, now of limited ambit, and a tort. The
essence of the crime is the agreement or understanding that the parties will
act unlawfully, whether or not it is implemented. The overt acts done pursuant
to it are relevant, if at all, only as evidence of the agreement or
understanding. It is sometimes suggested that the position in tort is
different. Lord Diplock, for example, thought that “the tort, unlike the crime,
consists not of agreement but of concerted action taken pursuant to agreement”:
<i>Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd</i> [1982] AC 173, 188. This is true in
the obvious sense that a tortious conspiracy, like most other tortious acts,
must have caused loss to the claimant, or the cause of action will be
incomplete. It follows that a conspiracy must necessarily have been acted on.
But there is no more to it than that. The critical point is that the tort of
conspiracy is not simply a particular form of joint tortfeasance. In the first
place, once it is established that a conspiracy has caused loss, it is
actionable as a distinct tort. Secondly, it is clear that it is not a form of
secondary liability, but a primary liability. This point had been made by Lord
Wright in <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Ltd v Veitch</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1941/2.html">[1942] AC 435</a>,
462: “the plaintiff’s right is that he should not be damnified by a conspiracy
to injure him, and it is in the fact of the conspiracy that the unlawfulness
resides.” It was reaffirmed by the House of Lords in <i>Revenue and Customs Comrs
v Total Network SL</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/19.html">[2008] AC 1174</a>, paras 102 (Lord Walker), 116 (Lord
Mance), 225 (Lord Neuberger). Third, the fact of combination may alter the legal
character and consequences of the overt acts. In particular, it may give rise
to liability which would not attach to the overt acts in the absence of
combination. This latter feature of the tort was what led Lord Wright in <i>Crofter</i>,
<i>loc cit</i>, to say that it was “in the fact of the conspiracy that the
unlawfulness resides.” He was speaking of a lawful means conspiracy, but as
Lord Hope pointed out in <i>Revenue and Customs Comrs v Total Network SL</i> at
para 44, the same applies to an unlawful means conspiracy, at any rate where
the means used, while not predominantly intended to injure the claimant, were
directed against him. There is clearly much force in his observation at para 41
that if a lawful means conspiracy is actionable on proof of a predominant
intention to injure, “harm caused by a conspiracy where the means used were
unlawful would seem no less in need of a remedy.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is it that makes the conspiracy actionable as such? To say that a
predominant purpose of injuring the claimant in the one case and the use of
unlawful means in the other supply the element of unlawfulness required to make
a conspiracy tortious simply restates the proposition in other words. A more
useful concept is the absence of just cause or excuse, which was invoked by
Bowen LJ in <i>Mogul Steamship Co v McGregor Gow &amp; Co</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1889/127.html">(1889) 23 QBD 598</a>, 614, by Viscount Cave LC in <i>Sorrell v Smith</i> [1925] AC 700, 711-712,
and by Viscount Simon LC with the support of his colleagues in <i>Crofter Hand
Woven Harris Tweed Ltd v Veitch</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1941/2.html">[1942] AC 435</a>, 441-444 (cf Viscount Maugham
at pp 448, 449-450, Lord Wright at pp 469-470, and Lord Porter at p 492). A
person has a right to advance his own interests by lawful means even if the
foreseeable consequence is to damage the interests of others. The existence of
that right affords a just cause or excuse. Where, on the other hand, he seeks
to advance his interests by unlawful means he has no such right. The position
is the same where the means used are lawful but the predominant intention of
the defendant was to injure the claimant rather than to further some legitimate
interest of his own. This is because in that case it cannot be an answer to say
that he was simply exercising a legal right. He had no interest recognised by
the law in exercising his legal right for the predominant purpose not of
advancing his own interests but of injuring the claimant. In either case, there
is no just cause or excuse <i>for the combination</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conspiracy being a tort of primary liability, the question what
constitute unlawful means cannot depend on whether their use would give rise to
a different cause of action independent of conspiracy. The real test is whether
there is a just cause or excuse for combining to use unlawful means. That
depends on (i) the nature of the unlawfulness, and (ii) its relationship with
the resultant damage to the claimant. This was the position reached by the
House of Lords in <i>Revenue and Customs Comrs v Total Network SL</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/19.html">[2008] AC 1174</a>. The Appellate Committee held that a criminal offence could be a
sufficient unlawful means for the purpose of the law of conspiracy, provided
that it was objectively directed against the claimant, even if the predominant
purpose was not to injure him.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts of <i>Total Network</i> were that the Commissioners had sued
Total for participating in a number of VAT frauds. They alleged an unlawful
means conspiracy, the unlawful means consisting of the commission by some of
the other conspirators of the common law offence of cheating the revenue. The
question whether such a cause of action existed was considered on the assumption
that there was no predominant intention to injure the Commissioners and that
the commission of the offence gave rise to no cause of action at the suit of
the Commissioners independently of the alleged conspiracy. In the result, the
House declined to apply to unlawful means conspiracies the condition which it
had held in <i>OBG Ltd v Allan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/21.html">[2008] AC 1</a> to apply to the tort of
intentionally harming the claimant by unlawful acts against third parties,
namely that those acts should be actionable at the suit of the third party.
They held that the means were unlawful for the purpose of founding an action in
conspiracy, whether they were actionable or not.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The leading speech was delivered by Lord Walker, with whom Lord Scott,
Lord Mance and Lord Neuberger agreed. Lord Hope, without agreeing so in terms,
proposed an analysis of this point which was consistent with Lord Walker’s. The
first point to be derived from the speeches concerns intention. The distinction
between cases where there is and cases where there is not a predominant
intention to injure the claimant, is an inadequate tool for determining
liability because it does not exhaust the possibilities. The emphasis in the
authorities on cases in which the predominant purpose was to injure the claimant
has diverted attention from the fact that both lawful means and unlawful means
conspiracies are torts of intent. But the nature of the intent required differs
as between the two. This is because a conspiracy may be directed against the claimant
notwithstanding that its predominant purpose is not to injure him but to
further some commercial objective of the defendant. This point had been made,
some years earlier, by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Canada Cement LaFarge
Ltd v British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd</i> </a><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1lpdg">[1983] 1 SCR 452</a>. After a
careful analysis of the (mainly English) authorities, Estey J, delivering the
judgment of the Court, concluded at pp 471-472 that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">“whereas the law
of tort does not permit an action against an individual defendant who has
caused injury to the plaintiff, the law of torts does recognize a claim against
them in combination as the tort of conspiracy if:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether
the means used by the defendants are lawful or unlawful, the predominant
purpose of the defendants’ conduct is to cause injury to the plaintiff; or,</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where
the conduct of the defendants is unlawful, the conduct is directed towards the
plaintiff (alone or together with others), and the defendants should know in
the circumstances that injury to the plaintiff is likely to and does result.</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">In situation (2)
it is not necessary that the pre-dominant purpose of the defendants’ conduct be
to cause injury to the plaintiff but, in the prevailing circumstances, it must
be a constructive intent derived from the fact that the defendants should have
known that injury to the plaintiff would ensue. In both situations, however,
there must be actual damage suffered by the plaintiff.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Likewise, in <i>Total Network</i>, Lord Walker, at para
82, recognised the</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“clear distinction between the
requirement of predominant purpose under one variety of the tort of conspiracy
and the lower requirement of intentional injury needed for the other variety.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These two varieties of intention were to be contrasted with a situation
in which the harm to the claimant was purely incidental because the unlawful
means were not the means by which the defendant intended the harm to the claimant:
see paras 93, 95. As an example of the latter situation, Lord Walker cited <i>Lonrho
Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2)</i> [1982] AC 173. The defendants in that
case were alleged to have acted in breach of the statutory order imposing sanctions
on Southern Rhodesia, but the order “was not the instrument for the intentional
infliction of harm” (para 95). Lord Mance in <i>Total Network</i> (para 119)
was, we think, making the same point, by reference to the example of a pizza
delivery business which obtains more custom, to the detriment of its
competitors, by instructing its drivers to ignore speed limits and jump red
lights. Addressing the character of the unlawfulness required, Lord Walker
derived from the authorities the proposition that</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“unlawful means, both in the
intentional harm tort and in the tort of conspiracy, include both crimes and
torts (whether or not they include conduct lower on the scale of
blameworthiness) provided that they are indeed the means by which harm is
intentionally inflicted on the claimant (rather than being merely incidental to
it).” (para 93, and cf para 95)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He concluded, at paras 94-95:</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para14">“From these and other authorities
I derive a general assumption, too obvious to need discussion, that criminal
conduct engaged in by conspirators as a means of inflicting harm on the
claimant is actionable as the tort of conspiracy, whether or not that conduct,
on the part of a single individual, would be actionable as some other tort … In
my opinion your Lordships should clarify the law by holding that criminal
conduct (at common law or by statute) can constitute unlawful means, provided
that it is indeed the means (what Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>OBG Ltd v
Allen</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/21.html">[2008] AC 1</a>, para 159 called ‘instrumentality’) of intentionally inflicting
harm.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hope arrived at the same conclusion, at paras 43 and
44, where addressing the facts of the case before him, he observed that
although there was no predominant intention to injure the Commissioners, “the
means used by the conspirators were directed at the claimants themselves”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a conspiracy is tortious if an
intention of the conspirators was to harm the claimant by using unlawful means
to persuade him to act to his own detriment, even if those means were not in
themselves tortious.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reasoning in <i>Total Network</i> leaves open the question how far
the same considerations apply to non-criminal acts, such as breaches of civil
statutory duties, or torts actionable at the suit of third parties, or breaches
of contract or fiduciary duty. These are liable to raise more complex problems.
Compliance with the criminal law is a universal obligation. By comparison,
legal duties in tort or equity will commonly and contractual duties will always
be specific to particular relationships. The character of these relationships
may vary widely from case to case. They do not lend themselves so readily to
the formulation of a general rule. Breaches of civil statutory duties give rise
to yet other difficulties. Their relevance may depend on the purpose of the relevant
statutory provision, which may or may not be consistent with its deployment as
an element in the tort of conspiracy. For present purposes it is unnecessary to

</span>The unlawful means relied upon in this case are criminal contempt of
court albeit that the offence is punishable in civil proceedings. The Bank does
not of course contend that the defendants’ predominant purpose in hiding Mr
Ablyazov’s assets was to injure it. Their predominant purpose was clearly to
further Mr Ablyazov’s financial interests as they conceived them to be. At the
same time, damage to the Bank was not just incidental to what they conspired to
do. It was necessarily intended. The freezing order and the receivership order
had been made on the application of the Bank for the purpose of protecting its
right of recovery in the event of the claims succeeding. The object of the
conspiracy and the overt acts done pursuant to it was to prevent the Bank from
enforcing its judgments against Mr Ablyazov, and the benefit to him was exactly
concomitant with the detriment to the Bank as both defendants must have
appreciated. In principle, therefore, we conclude the cause of action in
conspiracy to injure the Bank by unlawful means is made out. We say “in
principle”, because there remains an issue as to whether an action for
conspiracy to commit a contempt of court is consistent with public policy. To
that question we now turn.</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="ParaHeading">The alleged “preclusionary rule”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Bank argued that contempt of court, at least where it arises from
breach of a court order made at the instance of the claimant, is actionable as
such, even apart from any element of combination. It relies exclusively on
conspiracy, presumably for jurisdictional reasons. The only thing said to have
happened in England is the conspiratorial agreement. The overt acts all
occurred abroad. But the Bank submits that because contempt of court is
actionable as such, it necessarily constitutes unlawful means for the purposes
of the tort of conspiracy. The courts below described this submission as
“extreme” and rejected it. We do not propose to address it, because it follows
from the above analysis that it is irrelevant. The unlawfulness of the means to
be used to carry out the conspiracy does not depend on its actionability as an
independent tort.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>However, Mr Samek, who appeared for Mr Khrapunov, raised the issue in
support of his own case. He submitted that not only is there no right of action
for contempt of court as such, but the absence of such a cause of action
reflects a principle of public policy that persons in contempt of court should
not be exposed to anything other than criminal penalties at the discretion of
the court. He called this the “preclusionary rule”. It follows, he says, that
even if a non-actionable crime can in principle constitute unlawful means for
the purpose of the law of conspiracy, a claim for civil damages founded on a
contempt of court is contrary to public policy, however the cause of action may
be framed.</a></p><a name="para18">

</span>There is a certain amount of authority to support the existence of a
right to recover civil damages for contempt of court. The early cases, which go
back to the 14th century, are summarised in <i>Arlidge, Eady and Smith on
Contempt</i>, 5th ed (2017), paras 14.171-175. However, decisions made before
the development of the action on the case are unlikely to be of much assistance
in elucidating the modern law. More germane are <i>Couling v Coxe</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/1014.pdf">(1848) 6
CB 703</a>, where damages were awarded against a witness who declined to comply
with a subpoena as a result of which the plaintiff lost his case; <i>Fairclough
&amp; Sons v The Manchester Ship Canal</i> (1897) 41 SJ 225, where Lord Russell
CJ held that there had been no breach of the injunction relied upon in that
case, but considered that an inquiry as to damages might have been ordered had
there been one; and <i>In re Mileage Conference Group of the Tyre
Manufacturers’ Conference Ltd’s Agreement</i> [1966] 1 WLR 1137, 1162, where
Megaw J suggested, obiter, that a penal order against a contemnor might include
a direction for the payment of damages. The point was left open in the majority
judgments of the Court of Appeal in <i>Chapman v Honig</i> [1963] 2 QB 502, and
was held to be sufficiently arguable to preclude a striking out order by
Mustill J in <i>The “MESSINIAKI TOLMI”</i> [1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 666, 671.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The authorities against the existence of a right to damages are <i>In re
Hudson</i> [1966] 1 Ch 209, <i>N v Agrawal</i> [1999] PNLR 939 and <i>Customs
and Excise Comrs v Barclays Bank plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/28.html">[2007] 1 AC 181</a>. In <i>In re Hudson</i>
a wife claimed against the estate of her ex-husband an account of sums due
pursuant to an undertaking given by him in previous divorce proceedings to pay
her a third of his income. There was no evidence that the undertaking gave
effect to any underlying contractual settlement. Buckley J refused to order an
account because there was no enforceable right. The reason, he held, at p 214,
was that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the only sanction for breach of
an undertaking would be the imprisonment of the culprit or sequestration of his
assets or a fine on the ground of his contempt of court. An undertaking given
to the court, unless the circumstances are such that it has some collateral
contractual operation between the parties concerned, confers no personal right
or remedy upon any other party. The giver of the undertaking assumes thereby an
obligation to the court but to nobody else.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><i>N v Agrawal</i> was a claim for damages against a
medical practitioner by a woman who claimed to have been raped. Her case was
that the defendant had failed to appear to give evidence against the alleged
rapist at his trial, as a result of which the judge held that there was no case
to answer and she suffered psychological injury. The Court of Appeal held that
there was no duty of care. In the course of his judgment, Stuart-Smith LJ
briefly observed that “contempt of court does not itself give rise to a cause
of action”. He cited <i>Chapman v Honig</i> in support of this statement, although
the point had in fact been expressly left open in that case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Much the most significant judicial statements, however, are those made
by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords in <i>Customs and Excise Comrs
v Barclays Bank plc</i>. Barclays Bank had negligently allowed a payment to be
made out of an account in respect of which a freezing order had been made on
the application of the Commissioners. The Bank was not in contempt of the order
because the payment was inadvertent. The issue was whether, having been
notified of the order, it owed the Commissioners a duty of care. The House held
that it did not. Although the point does not appear to have been argued and
there was only limited citation of the relevant authorities, three members of
the committee drew an analogy with contempt of court, which they considered not
to be actionable as a tort. Lord Bingham said, at para 17:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the Mareva jurisdiction has
developed as one exercised by court order enforceable only by the court’s power
to punish those who break its orders. The documentation issued by the court
does not hint at the existence of any other remedy. This regime makes perfect
sense on the assumption that the only duty owed by a notified party is to the
court.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hoffmann said, at para 39:</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para21">“There is, in my opinion, a
compelling analogy with the general principle that, for the reasons which I
discussed in <i>Stovin v Wise</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/15.html">[1996] AC 923</a>, 943-944, the law of negligence
does not impose liability for mere omissions. It is true that the complaint is
that the bank did something: it paid away the money. But the payment is alleged
to be the breach of the duty and not the conduct which generated the duty. The
duty was generated ab extra, by service of the order. The question of whether
the order can have generated a duty of care is comparable with the question of
whether a statutory duty can generate a common law duty of care. The answer is
that it cannot: see <i>Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/15.html">[2004] 1 WLR 1057</a>. The statute either creates a statutory duty or it does not.
(That is not to say, as I have already mentioned, that conduct undertaken
pursuant to a statutory duty cannot generate a duty of care in the same way as
the same conduct undertaken voluntarily.) But you cannot derive a common law
duty of care directly from a statutory duty. Likewise, as it seems to me, you
cannot derive one from an order of court. The order carries its own remedies
and its reach does not extend any further.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Rodger said, at para 62:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Punishment for contempt of court
is the remedy which the law provides for the addressee’s failure to comply with
an injunction such as a freezing order.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Finally, at para 101 Lord Mance, expressing himself in
more guarded terms in the context of the Bank’s argument that the law of
contempt provided sufficient protection for the Commissioners, said this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But contempt requires proof to a
standard commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, and the sanctions
available to the court are not directed primarily at compensation, but at the
imposition of a penalty. It is true that, with sensible ingenuity, a sanction
can sometimes be tailored in such a way as to encourage the restoration of an
asset which has been improperly released from a freezing order or perhaps even
compensation: see eg the order made by Colman J in <i>Z Bank v D1</i> [1994] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 656, 668. But a civil remedy for breach of a duty of care would be
a much more satisfactory and complete protection than potential contempt
proceedings for a claimant like the commissioners.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These are powerful dicta, but we do not think that the last word has
necessarily been said on this subject in this court. It is unnecessary to
resolve the question now, because we consider that the case against a right of
action for breach of a court order cannot be based on any “preclusionary rule”
of public policy. When judges like Buckley J and Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffmann
and Lord Rodger say that the “sole remedy” for contempt is a criminal penalty,
they are not stating a principle of public policy let alone a “preclusionary
rule”. They are simply asserting that no private law right is engaged by a
contempt. There is a world of difference between the mere absence of a relevant
right and a rule of law precluding such a right even if the elements to support
it otherwise exist.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are rules of law relating to the conduct of legal proceedings
which clearly are based on a public policy precluding claims. A witness, for
example, is absolutely immune from civil liability for things said in evidence
or in circumstances directly preparatory to giving evidence. An action against him
for negligence or defamation would fail. If it were framed in conspiracy, it
would still fail, as it did in <i>Marrinan v Vibart</i> [1963] 1 QB 234. This
is because the objection to such an action is not the absence of the necessary
elements of a cause of action, but a special immunity based on a public policy
that a witness should be able to give evidence without fear of adverse legal
consequences other than prosecution for perjury or perverting the course of
justice. The public policy is engaged by any attempt to found a claim on what
the defendant did as a witness, irrespective of the legal label applied to it.
Mr Samek made a valiant but ultimately unconvincing attempt to bring the
present case within these principles. His submission, in summary, was that the
principles on which the law of contempt was founded required the Court to have
control over the consequences of a contempt, which it would not have if a right
of action existed. That was because a right of action would make damages for
contempt a matter of right, and might even lead to a claim for them being heard
in a foreign court. We are unmoved by these concerns. It is a commonplace of
the law that the same act may give rise to criminal and civil liability. It
necessarily follows that in such cases the sentence for the crime will be
discretionary but the civil consequences will not. Thus a person may be given
immunity in a criminal trial for burglary, for example because he agrees to
give evidence against others involved, but that will not protect him against
civil liability to the owner of the goods stolen. There is ample authority for
the proposition, which is perhaps obvious, that breach of an order of the court
is actionable where it gives effect to an underlying private law obligation
which is itself actionable, although the result is to produce exactly the
result that Mr Samek finds objectionable: see <i>Midland Marts Ltd v Hobday</i>
[1989] 1 WLR 1148, <i>Parker v Rasalingham</i> (Lawrence Collins QC,
unreported, 3 July 2000); and <i>Independiente Ltd v Music Trading On-line (HK)
Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/111.html">[2008] 1 WLR 608</a>. It is conceivable, although not very likely, that if
there were a cause of action for contempt of court, it might fall to be heard
in a foreign court, but we do not regard that as problematical and even if it
were we cannot conceive that the appropriate response is that such a claim
should not be entertained even in England. At first sight, there is more to be
said for the argument that a right of action for conspiring to breach a
freezing order injunction would expose foreigners to liability notwithstanding
the standard proviso in such orders that their terms “do not affect or concern
anyone outside the jurisdiction of this court”. But the proviso is irrelevant
to the position of a party in contempt, such as Mr Ablyazov, who is by
definition subject to the jurisdiction of the court. A claim in conspiracy will
normally allege conspiracy with the respondent to a court order to breach his
obligations under the order, as it does in this case.</p>

</span>Before Teare J, the Bank sought to rely on article 6 which provides that
a person domiciled in a state bound by the Convention may also be sued, where
he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one
of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is
expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of
irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings. The judge
rejected a submission on behalf of the Bank that it could rely on article 6
against Mr Khrapunov on the basis that at the relevant date in July 2015 Mr
Ablyazov was domiciled in England. The judge held that once Mr Ablyazov had
fled this jurisdiction he had no intention of returning and was not domiciled
here. There was no appeal against that conclusion. The judge also rejected a
submission on behalf of the Bank, founded on <i>R v Barnet London Borough
Council, Ex p Nilish Shah</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1982/14.html">[1983] 2 AC 309</a>, that Mr Ablyazov should,
nevertheless, be taken still to be domiciled in England because he was in breach
of an obligation under the worldwide freezing order prohibiting him from
leaving the jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal rejected an appeal against that
ruling and there is no appeal to this court on this point. It follows that we
are concerned only with article 5.</p>

the place where the damage occurred and (b) the place of the event giving rise

claimant “either in the courts for the place where the damage occurred or in
the courts for the place of the event which gives rise to and is at the origin
of that damage” (p 731F-G). Before Teare J and in the Court of Appeal the Bank

</span>The Bank’s argument that the damage occurred in England was based on the
contention that its worldwide freezing order and its judgments against Mr
Ablyazov were located here and had been reduced in value by the alleged conduct
in relation to assets in other jurisdictions. The judge rejected this argument.
He considered that the element of damage proximate to the harmful event was the
Bank’s inability or reduced ability to execute against those assets in the
places where they were located. This conclusion was upheld by the Court of
Appeal. The Bank did not initially seek to challenge this decision by a
cross-appeal. However, following a ruling by Lord Mance on 20 December 2017
that the Bank needed permission to cross-appeal in order to raise arguments
based on limb (a) of article 5(3), the Bank sought permission to cross-appeal
out of time on 21 December 2017. Mr Khrapunov filed a notice of objection on 3
January 2018. Permission to cross-appeal on this point was refused on 18
January 2018.</a></p><a name="para29">

conspiracy itself, which was hatched in England. Teare J rejected this
submission, because he considered that the cause of the damage was not the
conspiracy but its implementation. He considered that it was likely to have
been implemented by the decisions that Mr Ablyazov took and the instructions
that he gave. These things occurred in England until 16 February 2012 when Mr
Ablyazov fled the jurisdiction, but not thereafter. The Court of Appeal
disagreed. They held that the event giving rise to the damage was the conspiratorial
agreement in England.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>It is well established that the special jurisdiction provisions in Brussels/Lugano
scheme are derogations from the general rule conferring jurisdiction on the
courts of the place of the defendant’s domicile. As a result, they must be
strictly interpreted. As Lord Hodge recognised in <i>AMT Futures Ltd v
Marzillier mbH</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/13.html">[2017] 2 WLR 853</a> (at para 13), these heads of special
jurisdiction can be justified because they reflect a close connection between
the dispute and the courts of a contracting State, other than that in which the
defendant is domiciled, and thereby promote the efficient administration of
justice and proper organisation of the action: see, generally, <i>Dumez France
SA and Tracoba Sarl v Hessische Landesbank (Helaba)</i> (Case C-220/88) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/R22088.html">[1990] ECR I-49</a>, para 17; <i>Marinari v Lloyd’s Bank plc</i> (Case C-364/93) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C36493.html">[1996] QB 217</a>, para 16; <i>Kronhofer v Maier</i> (Case C-168/02) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C16802.html">[2004] 2 All ER (Comm) 759</a>; [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 284; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C16802.html">[2004] ECR I-6009</a>, para 15. Moreover, the
special jurisdictions, and article 5(3) in particular, have of necessity been
the subject of a series of decisions by the Court of Justice, which has
developed and illuminated the underlying principles in a way which assists in
their application. However, before turning to consider these authorities in
relation to article 5(3) it is necessary to say something about the respective
roles of the Convention regime and the relevant domestic law.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The expression “place where the harmful event occurred” in article 5(3)
requires an autonomous interpretation in order to ensure its effectiveness and
uniform application (<i>Coty Germany GmbH v First Note Perfumes NV</i> (Case
C-360/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C36012.html">[2014] Bus LR 1294</a>, paras 43-45). There is no basis for interpreting
article 5(3) by reference to national rules of non-contractual liability, for
such an approach would be incompatible with the object of the Convention which
is to provide a clear and certain attribution of jurisdiction (<i>Rosler v
Rottwinkel GmbH</i> (Case C-241/83) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1985/R24183.html">[1986] QB 33</a>, para 23; <i>Marinari v Lloyds
Bank plc</i> at paras 18, 19. See also <i>Melzer v MF Global UK Ltd</i> (Case
C-228/11) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C22811.html">[2013] QB 1112</a>.). It is against this background that the appellant
criticises the Court of Appeal for having focused on acts giving rise to
liability as opposed to damage. However, the requirement of an autonomous
interpretation does not mean that the component elements of the cause of action
in domestic law are irrelevant. On the contrary they have a vital role in
defining the legally relevant conduct and thus identifying the acts which fall
to be located for the purposes of article 5(3). In particular, whether an event
is harmful is determined by national law. To take an example raised during the
hearing of the appeal, if a firearm is manufactured in State A and fired in
State B the place of the event giving rise to the damage within article 5(3) is
likely to differ depending on whether the basis of the complaint in national
law is negligent manufacture of the firearm, or its negligent handling by the
gunman. In the same way, the place of the event giving rise to the damage may
vary depending on whether the cause of action is an unlawful means conspiracy
or a free-standing tortious act.</p>

</span>Thus in <i>Shevill v Presse Alliance SA</i> (Case C-68/93) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C6893.html">[1995] 2 AC 18</a> the Court of Justice emphasised (at paras 34-41) that the sole object of article
5(3) of the Brussels Convention is to allocate jurisdiction by reference to the
place or places where an event considered harmful occurred. It does not specify
the circumstances in which the event giving rise to the harm may be considered
harmful to the victim or the evidence which the claimant must adduce to enable
the court seised to rule on the merits of the case. This is because these are
matters for the national court applying the substantive law determined by its
own rules of private international law, national conflict of laws rules,
provided that the effectiveness of the Convention is not thereby impaired.
Accordingly, in <i>Shevill</i>, the fact that damage was presumed in libel
actions under the applicable national law, so that the claimant did not have to
adduce evidence of the existence and extent of that damage, did not preclude
the application of article 5(3) in determining which courts had jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From an early stage in the development of the jurisprudence on article
5(3) of the Brussels Convention, the Court of Justice in applying the second
limb of the <i>Bier</i> test, has emphasised the notion of the originating
event. In <i>Bier</i> itself the Court observed that liability in tort, delict
or quasi-delict can only arise if a causal connection can be established
between the damage and “the event in which that damage originates” (at para 16)
and went on to formulate the two limbs as permitting the exercise of
jurisdiction “either in the courts for the place where the damage occurred or
in the courts for the place of the event which gives rise to and is at the
origin of that damage” (at para 25). In <i>Shevill</i> the Court, having
repeated that paragraph from <i>Bier</i>, concluded (at para 24) that in the
case of a libel by a newspaper article distributed in several contracting
states, the place of the event giving rise to the damage can only be the place
where the publisher of the newspaper in question is established, “since that is
the place where the harmful event originated and from which the libel was
issued and put into circulation.” Similarly, in <i>Wintersteiger AG v Products
4U Sondermaschinenbau GmbH</i> (Case C-523/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C52310.html">[2013] Bus LR 150</a>, the Court of
Justice held that where a display on a search engine website of an
advertisement used a keyword identical to a national trade mark which it was
alleged to infringe, it was the activation by the advertiser of the technical
process displaying the advertisement and not the display of the advertisement
itself which should be considered to be the event giving rise to the alleged
infringement of trade mark.</p>

</span>In <i>Hejduk v EnergieAngentur NRW GmbH</i> (Case C-441/13) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C44113.html">[2015] Bus LR 560</a>, the claimant, a professional photographer domiciled in Austria, brought
proceedings in Austria against the defendant, a company registered in Germany,
alleging infringement of copyright in that it had placed some of her
photographs on its website without her consent. The Court of Justice held (at paras
24-25) that where the alleged tort consists in the infringement of copyright by
placing photographs online on a website, the activation of the process for the
technical display of the photographs on that website must be regarded as the
causal event and that, accordingly, the acts or omissions giving rise to the
damage were localised where the defendant had its seat, “since that is where
the company took and carried out the decision to place photographs online on a
particular website”.</p>

against Barclays bank alleging breach of obligations relating to a prospectus and
information for investors. The Court of Justice observed with regard to limb
(b) of article 5(3) that there was nothing to show that the decisions regarding
the arrangements for the investments proposed by the bank and the contents of
the relevant prospectuses were taken in Austria or that those prospectuses were
originally drafted and distributed anywhere other than the member state in
which the bank had its seat.</p>

</span>Turning to the decisions of domestic tribunals on the point, in <i>Domicrest
Ltd v Swiss Bank Corpn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/1998/2001.html">[1999] QB 548</a> the claimant, an English company,
alleged negligent mis-statement as to the effect of a payment order, made by
the defendant bank in Switzerland to the claimant in England. Rix J held that
the place of the event giving rise to the damage for the purpose of limb (b) of
article 5(3) was Switzerland where the statement originated. Having referred to
<i>Dumez</i>, <i>Shevill</i> and <i>Marinari</i>, Rix J observed that each in
its own way emphasised that to look to the later consequences would be to run
the risk of favouring the <i>forum actoris</i>, contrary to the objectives of
the Brussels Convention. He considered that he was not free to apply the broad
test involving identifying where the substance of the cause of action in tort
arose, which had been adopted by Steyn J in <i>Minster Investments Ltd v
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co Ltd</i> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 621 at p 624,
prior to those three decisions of the Court of Justice, but was required to
limit himself to “the more structured formula” adopted and applied in those decisions.
He continued (at p 567H):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Applying that formula, it seems
to me that the place where the harmful event giving rise to the damage occurs
in a case of negligent mis-statement is, by analogy with the tort of
defamation, where the mis-statement originates. It is there that the
negligence, even if not every element of the tort, is likely to take place; and
for that and other reasons the place from which the mis-statement is put into
circulation is as good a place in which to found jurisdiction as the place
where the mis-statement is acted on, even if receipt and reliance are essential
parts of the tort. For these purposes it seems to me that there is no
difference between a written document and an oral or other instantaneous
communication sufficient to distinguish between such cases. Although it may be
argued that in the case of instantaneous communications and perhaps especially
in the case of telephone conversations the mis-statement occurs as much where
it is heard as where it is spoken, nevertheless it remains true as it seems to
me that it is the representor’s negligent speech rather than the hearer’s
receipt of it which best identifies the harmful event which sets the tort in
motion. To prefer receipt and reliance as epitomising the harmful event giving
rise to the damage in the case of negligent mis-statement is, I think, to
ignore the fact that the plaintiff also has the option of suing in the courts
of the place where the damage occurs - which is quite likely to be at the place
of receipt and reliance.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This reasoning and conclusion have been expressly
approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>ABCI v Banque Franco-Tunisienne </i>[2003]
2 Lloyd’s Rep 146, per Mance LJ at para 41. They have also been applied in a
series of first instance decisions. (Alfred Dunhill Ltd v Diffusion Internationale
Maroquinerie de Prestige SARL  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2001/2002.html">[2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 950</a> , at p 957;  Newsat Holdings Ltd v Zani <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2006/342.html">[2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 607</a>, at paras 41-44; and London Helicopters Ltd v Heliportugal LDA-INAC <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2006/108.html">[2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 595</a>, at

</span>In our opinion, this approach accords with the principles to be derived
from the decisions of the Court of Justice. Although the precise terminology
employed by Rix J is not derived from the decisions of the Court of Justice, it
is an accurate statement of the law. We do not accept that it detracts from the
“need to consider the causative impact of the candidate events by improperly
focussing on the acts which were first in time”. This criticism misrepresents
the effect of the decisions of the Court of Justice considered above, which
does not require a comparative consideration of the causative impact of
different events. On the contrary, the Court of Justice emphasises the relevant
harmful event which sets the tort in motion, thereby providing a greater degree
of certainty in the application of the Convention. This gives effect to an important
policy of the Brussels/Lugano scheme, recognised in <i>Bier</i> at para 21, by
promoting “a helpful connecting factor with the jurisdiction of a court
particularly near to the cause of the damage”.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>In <i>Cartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA v Akzo Nobel NV</i>
(Case C-352/13) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C35213.html">[2015] QB 906</a>, the European Commission had decided that several
companies had participated in a single and continuous infringement of the prohibition
of cartel agreements. It was not possible to point to a single jurisdiction in
which the cartel had been formed since it consisted of a number of collusive
agreements which had been concluded during meetings at various places
throughout Europe. Several customers of these companies alleged that they had
suffered loss by reason of the cartel and they assigned their potential claims
to the applicant, a Belgian company. The applicant brought proceedings in
Germany for damages and disclosure against six of the companies which were
incorporated in various member states. The German court referred to the Court
of Justice a series of questions, including one relating to jurisdiction under
article 5(3), Brussels Regulation. Having observed (at para 39) that the rule
of special jurisdiction is based on the existence of a close link between the
dispute and the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may
occur, the Court continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the place
of the causal event, it must be pointed out at the outset that, in
circumstances such as those in the present case, the buyers were supplied by
various participants in the cartel within the scope of their contractual
relations. However, the event giving rise to the alleged loss did not consist
in a potential breach of contractual obligations, but in a restriction of the
buyer’s freedom of contract as a result of that cartel in the sense that that
restriction prevented the buyer from being supplied at a price determined by
the rules of supply and demand.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those circumstances,
the place of a causal event of loss consisting in additional costs that a buyer
had to pay because a cartel has distorted market prices can be identified, in
the abstract, as the place of the conclusion of the cartel. Once concluded, the
participants in a cartel ensure through action or forbearance that there is no
competition and that prices are distorted. Where the place of a cartel’s
conclusion is known, it would be consistent with the aims outlined in para 39
above for the courts of that place to have jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court concluded that this reasoning was impossible to apply to a
cartel which could not be located in a single jurisdiction. It then stated its
conclusion in the following terms.</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that
jurisdiction by virtue of article 5(3) of Regulation No
44/2001 to adjudicate, on the basis of the causal event and with
regard to all of the perpetrators of an unlawful cartel which allegedly
resulted in loss, depends upon the identification, in the jurisdiction of the
court seised of the matter, of a specific event during which either that cartel
was definitively concluded or one agreement in particular was made which was
the sole causal event giving rise to the loss allegedly inflicted on a buyer.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In other words, the Court concluded that it was the
formation of the cartel and not its implementation which was the event giving
rise to the damage.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We consider that the Court of Appeal correctly identified the place
where the conspiratorial agreement was made as the place of the event which
gives rise to and is at the origin of the damage. As Sales LJ explained (at para
76), in entering into the agreement Mr Khrapunov would have encouraged and
procured the commission of unlawful acts by agreeing to help Mr Ablyazov to
carry the scheme into effect. Thereafter, Mr Khrapunov’s alleged dealing with
assets the subject of the freezing and receivership orders would have been
undertaken pursuant to and in implementation of that agreement, whether or not
he was acting on instructions from Mr Ablyazov. The making of the agreement in
England should, in our view, be regarded as the harmful event which set the
tort in motion.</a></p><a name="para41">
