<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principal issue in these two appeals relates to the circumstances in
which the concept of “statutory incompatibility” will defeat an application to
register land as a town or village green where the land is held by a public
authority for statutory purposes. In <i>R (Newhaven Port &amp; Properties Ltd)
v East Sussex County Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] UKSC 7</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a> (“<i>Newhaven</i>”)
this court held that the duty under section 15 of the Commons Act 2006 did not
extend to an area held under the specific statutes relating to the Newhaven
Harbour. We are asked to decide whether the same principle applies to land held
by statutory authorities under more general statutes, relating respectively (in
these two cases) to education and health services.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the two appeals raise similar issues, they were dealt with by
different procedural routes. The first (Lancashire) is within the area of a
“pilot” scheme under the Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2008, under
which, where the registration authority (in this case Lancashire County Council
- “LCC”) has an interest in the land, applications are referred for
determination to the Planning Inspectorate (regulations 27-28). The second case
(Surrey) was not covered by the pilot scheme. The application was determined by
Surrey County Council as registration authority, following a non-statutory
inquiry before a barrister appointed by the council.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Modern greens - development of the law</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As will be seen, in <i>Newhaven </i>the issue was described as one of
“statutory interpretation”. Unfortunately, interpreting the will of Parliament
in this context is problematic, because there is no indication that the concept
of a modern green, as it has been developed by the courts, was part of the
original thinking under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Lord Carnwath reviewed
the earlier history, including the Report of the Royal Commission on Common
Land 1955-1958 (1958) (Cmnd 462) which preceded the 1965 Act, in his judgments at
first instance in <i>R v Suffolk County Council, Ex p Steed </i>(1995) 71 P
&amp; CR 463 (one of the first cases under the 1965 Act), and later in the
Court of Appeal in<i> Oxfordshire County Council v Oxford City Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/175.html">[2006] Ch 43</a> (“the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case”). As he observed in the latter:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of a ‘modern’
class c green, as it has emerged in the cases since 1990, would, I think, have
come as a surprise to the Royal Commissioners, and to the draftsman of the 1965
Act. There is no hint of it in the Royal Commission Report, or the
Parliamentary Debates on the Bill. The commissioners’ terms of reference were
directed to sorting out the problems of the past, not to creating new
categories of open land, for which there was no obvious need. By this time, of
course, there were numerous statutes conferring on public authorities modern
powers for the creation and management of recreational spaces for the public.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Carnwath also noted, at para 52, that, as late as
1975, in <i>New Windsor Corpn v Mellor </i>[1976] Ch 380 (“<i>New Windsor</i>”),
all three members of the Court of Appeal (including Lord Denning MR) had
thought it natural to read the Act as referring to 20 years “before the passing
of the Act” (at pp 391, 395) - an interpretation which would have ruled out the
possibility of a modern green being established by more recent use.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was not until the early 1990s that claims were first put forward
based on 20 years’ use since the 1965 Act had come into force at the end of
July 1970 (apparently following the advice of the Open Spaces Society in their
publication <i>Getting Greens Registered </i>(1995)). When the first case came
before the House of Lords in 1999 (<i>R v Oxfordshire County Council, Ex p
Sunningwell Parish Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/28.html">[2000] 1 AC 335</a> - “<i>Sunningwell</i>”), no one seems
to have argued that the Act was directed to pre-1965 use only. In that case,
the House of Lords, led by Lord Hoffmann, adopted a relatively expansive view
of the new concept. He drew a parallel with the Rights of Way Act 1932, which
he thought had reflected Parliament’s view “that the previous law gave too much
weight to the interests of the landowner and too little to the preservation of
rights of way which had been for many years in de facto use” and the “strong
public interest in facilitating the preservation of footpaths for access to the
countryside” (p 359D-E). He commented, at p 359E:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… in defining class c town or
village greens by reference to similar criteria in 1965, Parliament recognised
a similar public interest in the preservation of open spaces which had for many
years been used for recreational purposes.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That interpretation of Parliament’s thinking would, with respect, have
been difficult to deduce from the 1965 Act itself, or from anything said - in
Parliament or anywhere else - at the time. However, when the issue came before
the House again, in the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/25.html">[2006] 2 AC 674</a>, Lord Hoffmann
was able to claim implicit Parliamentary support in the debates which preceded
the amendments made by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. As he said,
at para 26:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“No one voiced any concern about
the construction which the House in its judicial capacity had given to the 1965
Act. On the contrary, the only question raised in debate was whether the
locality rule did not make it too difficult to register new village greens.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">By then, as he also noted (para 28) the new Commons Bill
(the 2006 Act as it became) was before Parliament, providing a further
opportunity for legislative reconsideration if thought appropriate. In <i>Newhaven
</i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a>, para 18,<i> </i>this fact was cited as a reason for not
having given permission to reopen the general approach adopted in the <i>Trap
Grounds </i>case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the attributes of a modern green, the 2006 Act itself, like the
1965 Act which preceded it, is very sparse in the information it gives. Section
1 of the 2006 Act requires each registration authority to maintain a register
of town or village greens. Section 15 indicates that any person can apply to
register land as a green where, in subsection (1)(a) -</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a significant number of the inhabitants
of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged as of
right in lawful sports and pastimes on the land for the period of at least 20
years …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As to the purpose of registration, section 2(2)(a) states
simply that the purpose of the register is “to register land as a town or
village green”. The Act offers no further guidance as to the interpretation of
the section 15 formula, nor as to the practical consequences of registration.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An unexplained curiosity is that section 10 of the 1965 Act, which
provided that the register was “conclusive evidence of the matters registered,
as at the date of registration”, is not repeated in the 2006 Act. As things
stand the repeal of section 10 has been brought into effect only in the pilot
areas. (Section 18 of the 2006 Act, headed “Conclusiveness”, which has effect
in the pilot areas, does not on its face go so far as section 10.) In the <i>Trap
Grounds </i>case, Lord Hoffmann had agreed (at para 43) with Lord Carnwath’s
analysis in the Court of Appeal </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/175.html">[2006] Ch 43</a>, para 100, that the 1965 Act
“created no new legal status, and no new rights or liabilities other than those
resulting from the proper interpretation of section 10”. It was on the
“rational construction of section 10” that he relied for his view that land
registered as a town or village green “can be used generally for sports and
pastimes” (para 50), and was also subject to section 12 of the Inclosure Act
1857 and section 29 of the Commons Act 1876 (para 56). None of the experienced
counsel before us was able to offer an explanation for the disappearance of
section 10, but none sought to argue that it had made any material difference
to the rights following registration. Not without some hesitation, we shall proceed
on that basis.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann made clear that, following registration, the owner was not
excluded altogether, but retained the right to use the land in any way which
does not interfere with the recreational rights of the inhabitants, with “give
and take on both sides” (para 51). That qualification was further developed in <i>R
(Lewis) v Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/1.html">[2010] UKSC 1</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/11.html">[2010] 2 AC 70</a> (“<i>Lewis</i>”), in which it was held that the local inhabitants’ rights to
use a green following registration could not interfere with competing
activities of the landowner to a greater extent than during the qualifying
period.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One important control mechanism which emerged from the cases was the
need for the use to be “as of right”. It was established that these words, by
analogy with the law of easements, imported the principle “nec vi, nec clam,
nec precario”, or in other words “the absence of any of the three
characteristics of compulsion, secrecy or licence” (per Scott LJ in <i>Jones v
Bates</i> [1938] 2 All ER 237, 245, cited by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Sunningwell </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/28.html">[2000] 1 AC 335</a>, 355). It followed that in practice an owner could prevent use
qualifying under section 15 by making it sufficiently clear to those seeking to
use the land (generally by suitable notices) either that their use was objected
to, or that it was permissive. On the other hand, silent acquiescence in the
use, or toleration, did not prevent it being “as of right”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>More recently (from 25 April 2013) amendments made by the Growth and
Infrastructure Act 2013 (embodied in new sections 15A and following of the 2006
Act) have provided some assistance to landowners, first by enabling a formal
statement to be made to bring user “as of right” to an end, and secondly by
defining certain planning-related “trigger events” which suspend or extinguish
the right to apply to register a green. In <i>Wiltshire Council v Cooper
Estates Strategic Land Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/840.html">[2019] EWCA Civ 840</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/840.html">[2019] PTSR 1980</a>, para 4,
Lewison LJ said of these amendments:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Ever since the <i>Trap Grounds</i>
case … the courts have adopted a definition of a TVG [town or village green]
which goes far beyond what the mind’s eye would think of as a traditional
village green. The consequence of this interpretation of the definition is that
there have been registered as TVGs: rocks, car parks, golf courses, school
playgrounds, a quarry, scrubland, and part of a working port. If land is
registered as a TVG the effect of the registration is, for practical purposes,
to sterilise land for development. This became a concern for the Government,
because the criteria for registration did not take into account any planning
considerations; and because it was thought in some quarters that applications
for registration of TVGs were being used as a means of stopping development
outside the planning system.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The 2013 amendments are of no direct relevance to the
issues in the present appeal, but they are relied on as showing that Parliament
has given specific attention to the balance to be drawn between the rights of
the various interests involved.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We would draw two main lessons from the historical review. First,
whatever misgivings one may have about the unconventional process by which the
concept of a modern green became part of our law, the emphasis now should be on
consolidation, not innovation. Secondly, the balance between the interests of
landowners and those claiming recreational rights, as established by the
authorities, and as now supplemented by the 2013 Act, should be respected. Our
task in the present appeal is not to make policy judgments, but simply to
interpret the majority judgment in <i>Newhaven</i> and apply it to the facts of
these cases.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>The land at issue in the first appeal is known as Moorside Fields, in
Lancaster. It lies adjacent to Moorside Primary School and extends to some 13
hectares. It is divided into five areas, referred to in the proceedings as Areas
A to E, described (by the planning inspector) as follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Area A, referred to as the meadow
was, until recently, an undeveloped plot of land. It is adjacent to Moorside
Primary School (the school) and is currently being used to facilitate the
construction of an extension at the rear of the school. Area B is a mowed
field, referred to as the school playing field and both it and Area A are
currently surrounded by fencing.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Areas C and D border Areas A and
B. In the past they have been the subject of mowing tenancy agreements but
these ceased in around 2001. They are separated from each other and from Areas
A and B by … hedges and in places are overgrown with brambles. Area E, also
adjacent to the school, is currently overgrown and difficult to access. At some
times of the year it contains a pond.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Like the school the land is owned by LCC, the present
appellant, which is both education authority and registration authority.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 9 February 2010 Ms Janine Bebbington, a local resident, applied to
register the land as a town or village green. Her application was based on 20
years’ qualifying use up to the date of registration, or alternatively up to 2008.
LCC, as local education authority, objected. Following a statutory inquiry, an
inspector appointed by the Secretary of State (Ms Alison Lea, a solicitor) in a
decision letter dated 22 September 2015 determined that four of the five areas
(that is A to D, but not E) should be registered under the Act. She excluded
Area E because she found insufficient evidence of its use over the 20 year
period. LCC has postponed formal registration of Areas A to D, pending the
outcome of the judicial review claim.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>LCC maintains that the land was acquired for and remains appropriated to
educational purposes, in exercise of the LCC’s statutory powers as education
authority. The statutory provisions upon which LCC relied (or now rely) as
showing incompatibility were: (1) section 8 of the 1944 Education Act which
imposed a duty on local education authorities “to secure that there shall be
available for their area sufficient schools” for providing primary and
secondary education, sufficient in number, character and equipment; (2)
sections 13 and 14 of the Education Act 1996 which require local authorities to
contribute to the development of the community by securing efficient primary
and secondary education; (3) section 542 of the 1996 Act which requires school
premises to conform to prescribed standards, including (under regulation 10 of the

</span>The inspector was not satisfied that the land was held for educational
purposes (an issue to which we shall return below), but even on the assumption
that it was she found no incompatibility:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“119.&nbsp; Furthermore, even if the
land is held for ‘educational purposes’, I agree with the applicant that that
could cover a range of actual uses. LCC states that the landholding is
associated with a specific statutory duty to secure a sufficiency of schools
and that if LCC needed to provide a new school or extra school accommodation in
Lancaster in order to enable it to fulfil its statutory duty, it would not be
able to do so on the Application Land were it to be registered as a town or
village green. However, Areas A and B are marked on LCC’s plan as Moorside
Primary School. The school is currently being extended on other land and will,
according to Lynn MacDonald [a school planning manager for the county council],
provide 210 places which will meet current needs. There is no evidence to
suggest that the school wishes to use these areas other than for outdoor
activities and sports and such use is not necessarily incompatible with use by
the inhabitants of the locality for lawful sports and pastimes.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas C and D are marked
on LCC’s plan as ‘Replacement School Site’. However, there is no evidence that
a new school or extra school accommodation is required on this site, or indeed
anywhere in Lancaster. Lynn MacDonald stated that the Application Land may need
to be brought into education provision at some time but confirmed that there
were no plans for the Application Land within her five-year planning phase.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, she pointed
out there is a rising birth rate and increased housing provision in Lancaster,
and that although there are surplus school places to the north of the river, no
other land is reserved for school use to the south of Lancaster. Assets are
reviewed on an annual basis and if not needed land can be released for other
purposes. However there was no prospect that this would happen in relation to
the Application Land in the immediate future.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not agree with LCC’s
submission that the evidence of Lynn MacDonald demonstrates the necessity of
keeping the Application Land available to guarantee adequate future school
provision in order to meet LCC’s statutory duty. Even if at some stage in the
future there becomes a requirement for a new school or for additional school
places within Lancaster, it is not necessarily the case that LCC would wish to
make that provision on the Application Land.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">She concluded (para 124):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“124.&nbsp; It seems to me that, in the
absence of further evidence, the situation in the present case is not
comparable to the statutory function of continuing to operate a working harbour
where the consequences of registration as a town or village green on the
working harbour were clear to their Lordships [in <i>Newhaven</i>]. Even if it
is accepted that LCC hold the land for ‘educational purposes’, there is no
‘clear incompatibility’ between LCC’s statutory functions and registration of
the Application Land as a town or village green. Accordingly I do not accept
that the application should fail due to statutory incompatibility.”</p>

</span>The second appeal relates to some 2.9 hectares of land at Leach Grove
Wood, Leatherhead, owned by NHS Property Services Ltd (“NHS Property
Services”), a company wholly owned by the Secretary of State for Health. The
land adjoins Leatherhead Hospital, and is in the same freehold title. An
application for registration under the Act was made by Ms Philippa Cargill on
22 March 2013, with the support of Mr Timothy Jones and others. They relied on
use over a period of 20 years ending in January 2013 (when permissive signs
were erected on the land).</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>At the time of the application, the land was owned by the Surrey Primary
Care Trust. By section 83(1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 primary
care trusts were under a duty to provide, or to secure the provision of,
primary medical services in their area. The land was held by the Trust pursuant
to the statute, for those purposes. On the dissolution of the Trust in 2013,
the freehold title of the land was transferred to NHS Property Services, which
had been created by the Secretary of State for Health under his power to form
companies “to provide facilities or services to persons or bodies exercising
functions, or otherwise providing services, under this Act” (section 223(1) of
the National Health Service Act 2006). Following the amendment of the National
Health Service Act 2006 by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, functions
previously exercised by the Secretary of State acting through a primary care
trust fell to be exercised by a clinical commissioning group (“CCG”) - in this
case the Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group. The principal statutory
duties of a CCG are defined by section 3(1) of the National Health Service Act
2006; in summary they involve the provision of hospital accommodation and
medical services “to such extent as it considers necessary to meet the
reasonable requirements of the persons for whom it has responsibility”.</a></p><a name="para18">

</span>Following a non-statutory inquiry, the inspector, William Webster,
barrister, in his report dated 9 June 2015, recommended refusal of
registration. He rejected the company’s objection based on statutory
incompatibility (paras 175(d)-(f)). He contrasted the case with <i>Newhaven</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a> in which there had been “an obvious and irreconcilable clash as
between the conflicting statutory regimes”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … The position of the NHS
is quite different in that no positive duty (analogous to that imposed on the
undertaker in <i>Newhaven</i>) arises on the part of the landowner to do
anything in the case of the land (in contrast to <i>Newhaven</i>) and the
general duty imposed on the Secretary of State to promote a comprehensive
health service is wholly unaffected.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that it
is irrelevant that the land may be held under the same title as the remainder
of the hospital site. The fact that the relevant NHS bodies had (and still has
[sic]) the capacity to use the land for health and ancillary purposes is no
different to any other public body holding land for a purpose which they do not
choose to exercise for the time being.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He also accepted that there had been sufficient
qualifying use of the land by local inhabitants for more than 20 years, but he
held that it was not in respect of a relevant “locality” or “neighbourhood” as
required by section 15. Surrey County Council, as registration authority, did
not accept his recommendation, but determined to register the land which was
done on 5 October 2015.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the application for judicial review by NHS Property Services, on 13 July
2016 Gilbart J (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1715.html">[2016] EWHC 1715 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/611.html">[2017] 4 WLR 130</a>) quashed the
registration, holding that the county council had failed properly to consider
the question of statutory incompatibility. He had before him the judgment of
Ouseley J in the Lancashire case (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1238.html">[2016] EWHC 1238 (Admin)</a>), but distinguished
it by reference to the wider powers conferred by the education statutes:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“134.&nbsp; … It is clear that there
was no general power in any of the relevant bodies to hold land. Land could
only be acquired or held if done so for the purposes defined in the relevant
Acts. The defined statutory purposes do not include recreation, or indeed
anything outside the purview of (in summary) the purposes of providing health
facilities. Could the land be used for the defined statutory purposes while
also being used as a town or village green? No-one has suggested that the land
in its current state would perform any function related to those purposes, and
the erection of buildings or facilities to provide treatment, or for administration
of those facilities, or for car parking to serve them, would plainly conflict
with recreational use.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is very hard
indeed to think of a use for the land which is consistent with those powers,
and which would not involve substantial conflict with use as a village green. A
hospital car park, or a clinic, or an administrative building, or some other
feature of a hospital or clinic would require buildings or hard standing in
some form over a significant part of the area used. By contrast, it is easy to
think of functions within the purview of education, whereby land is set aside
for recreation. Indeed, there is a specific statutory duty to provide
recreational facilities, which may include playing fields, and other land, for
recreation, the playing of games, and camping, among other activities - see
section 507A Education Act 1996.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not relevant to the
determination of the issue that the land has not in fact been used for the
erection of hospital buildings or used for other hospital related purposes. The
question which must be determined is not the factual one of whether it has been
used, or indeed whether there any plans that it should be, but only whether
there is incompatibility as a matter of statutory construction. If the land is
in fact surplus to requirements, then the use of the [2006 Act] is not the
remedy.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given those conclusions,
it is my judgement that there is a conflict between the statutory powers in
this case and registration.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Court of Appeal</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeals in both cases, respectively by LCC and the applicants for
registration in the Surrey case, were heard together by the Court of Appeal
(Jackson, Lindblom and Thirlwall LJJ). In a judgment dated 12 April 2018
(</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/721.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 721</a>; [2018] 2 P &amp; CR 15), given by Lindblom LJ, with whom
the others agreed, the court upheld the decision to register in both cases. On
the issue of statutory incompatibility, he distinguished the <i>Newhaven </i>case
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a>, for reasons which are sufficiently apparent from the following
short extracts from the judgment:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><i>Lancashire</i></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucially, as a matter of
‘statutory construction’ there was no inconsistency of the kind that arose in Newhaven
Port &amp; Properties between the provisions of one statute and the provisions
of the other. The statutory purpose for which Parliament had authorized the
acquisition and use of the land and the operation of section 15 of the 2006 Act
were not inherently inconsistent with each other. By contrast with Newhaven
Port &amp; Properties, there were no ‘specific’ statutory purposes or
provisions attaching to this particular land. Parliament had not conferred on
the county council, as local education authority, powers to use this particular
land for specific statutory purposes with which its registration as a town or
village green would be incompatible.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><i>Surrey</i></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the Lancaster
case, therefore, the circumstances did not correspond to those of Newhaven Port
&amp; Properties. The land was not being used for any ‘defined statutory
purposes’ with which registration would be incompatible. No statutory purpose
relating specifically to this particular land would be frustrated. The
ownership of the land by NHS Property Services, and the existence of statutory
powers that could be used for the purposes of developing the land in the
future, was not enough to create a ‘statutory incompatibility’. The clinical
commissioning group would still be able to carry out its statutory functions in
the provision of hospital and other accommodation and the various services and facilities
within the scope of its statutory responsibilities if the public had the right
to use the land at Leach Grove Wood for recreational purposes, even if the land
itself could not then be put to use for the purposes of any of the relevant
statutory functions. None of those general statutory functions were required to
be performed on this land. And again, it is possible to go somewhat further
than that. Although the registration of the land as a village green would
preclude its being developed by the construction of a hospital or an extension
to the existing hospital, or as a clinic or administrative building, or as a
car park, and even though the relevant legislation did not include a power or
duty to provide facilities for recreation, there would be nothing inconsistent
- either in principle or in practice - between the land being registered as a
green and its being kept open and undeveloped and maintained as part of the
Leatherhead Hospital site, whether or not with access to it by staff, patients
or visitors. This would not prevent or interfere with the performance of any of
the relevant statutory functions. But in any event, as in the Lancaster case,
the two statutory regimes were not inherently in conflict with each other.
There was no ‘statutory incompatibility’.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Was the Lancashire land held for educational purposes?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before we turn to the main issue it is convenient to dispose of a
preliminary issue which arises only in respect of the first appeal. For what
purposes was the land held? The inspector recorded the evidence on which LCC
relied as showing that the land was held for the relevant statutory purposes.</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“113.&nbsp; LCC has provided Land
Registry Official copies of the register of title which show that LCC is the
registered proprietor of the Application Land. Areas A, B and E were the
subject of a conveyance dated 29 June 1948, a copy of which has been provided.
It makes no mention of the purposes for which the land was acquired but is
endorsed with the words ‘Recorded in the books of the Ministry of Education
under section 87(3) of the Education Act 1944’. The endorsement is dated 12
August 1948.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas C and D were the
subject of a conveyance dated 25 August 1961. Again the conveyance makes no
mention of the purposes for which the land was acquired but the copy provided
has a faint manuscript endorsement as follows ‘Education Lancaster Greaves
County Secondary School’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition LCC provided
an instrument dated 23 February 1925 and a letter from LCC to the school dated
1991. The instrument records that the Council of the Borough of Lancaster has
applied to the Minister of Health for consent to the appropriation for the
purposes of the Education Act 1921 of the land acquired by the council
otherwise than in their capacity as Local Education Authority. The land shown
on the plan is the [Barton Road Playing Field (land also owned by LCC, to the
immediate west of Areas C and D and separated from them by a shallow
watercourse, but accessible from them via a stone bridge and also stepping
stones)]. An acknowledgement and undertaking dated March 1949 refers to the
transfer to the county council of the education functions of the City of
Lancaster and lists deeds and documents relating to school premises and other
land and premises held by the corporation. It lists the [Barton Road Playing
Field]. The 1991 letter encloses a note from Lancashire Education Committee
outlining a proposal to declare land surplus to educational requirements. This
relates to the land adjacent to Area C which was subsequently developed for
housing. As none of this documentation relates directly to the Application Land
I do not find it of particular assistance.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the inquiry LCC
provided a print out of an electronic document headed ‘Lancashire County
Council - Property Asset Management Information’ which in relation to ‘Moorside
Primary School’ records the committee as ‘E’. I accept that it is likely that
this stands for ‘Education’. An LCC plan showing land owned by ‘CYP education’
shows Areas A, B and E as Moorside Primary School and Areas C and D as
‘Replacement School Site’. In relation to Areas C and D the terrier was
produced, and under ‘committee’ is the word ‘education’. The whole page has a
line drawn through it, the reason for which is unexplained.”</p>

</span>The inspector stated her conclusions:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“117.&nbsp; LCC submits that the
documentation provides clear evidence that the Application Land is held for
educational purposes and that no further proof is necessary. However, no council
resolution authorising the purchase of the land for educational purposes or
appropriating the land to educational purposes has been provided. The
conveyances themselves do not show for what purpose the council acquired the
land, and although the endorsements on those documents make reference to
education, the authority for them is unknown. Lynn MacDonald … confirmed that
the Application Land was identified as land which may need to be brought into
education provision, but was unable to express an opinion about the detail of
LCC’s ownership of the land.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information with
regard to the purposes for which the Application Land is held by LCC is
unsatisfactory. Although there is no evidence to suggest that it is held other
than for educational purposes, it is not possible to be sure that LCC’s
statement that ‘the Application Land was acquired and is held for educational
purposes and was so held throughout the 20-year period relevant to the
Application’ accurately reflects the legal position.”</p>

</span>In fairness to the inspector, we should note that this issue seems to
have been raised rather the late in the day, and was less than fully explored
in LCC’s submissions before her (see Ouseley J </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1238.html">[2016] EWHC 1238 (Admin)</a>, para

at the inquiry.</p>

</span>Ouseley J indicated that, left to himself, he would have been likely to
have reached a different view, at para 57:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I rather doubt that, confined to
the express reasoning in the DL [the decision letter], I would have reached the
same conclusion as the inspector as to what could be inferred from the
conveyances and endorsements on them in relation to the purpose of the
acquisition of the various areas. I can see no real reason not to conclude, on
that basis, that the acquisition was for educational purposes. No other
statutory purpose for the acquisition was put forward; there was no suggestion
that the parcels were acquired for public open space. I would have inferred that
there were resolutions in existence authorising the acquisitions for that
contemporaneously evidenced intended purpose, which simply had not been found
at this considerable distance in time. It would be highly improbable for the
lands to have been purchased without resolutions approving it. The presumption
of regularity would warrant the assumption that there had been resolutions to
that effect, and that the purpose resolved upon would have been the one
endorsed on the conveyances. This is reinforced by the evidence in DL para 116,
which shows the property, after acquisition, to be managed by or on behalf of
the Education Committee. The actual use made of some of the land is of limited
value in relation to the basis of its acquisition or continued holding.”</p>

irrational, at para 61:</a></p><a name="para26">

26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“As
I read the DL, the fundamental problem for the inspector in the LCC evidence
was the absence of what she regarded as the primary sources for power under
which the acquisition or appropriation of the land occurred: the resolutions to
acquire or to appropriate it for educational purposes. She was entitled to
regard those as the primary sources to prove the basis for the exercise of the
powers of the authority …</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">she
approached her decision, as I read it, knowing what transpired before her, not
on the basis that resolutions related to acquisition might well have existed
but could not be found at this distance in time, but on the basis that none had
been produced despite proper endeavours to find them, endeavours which had
nonetheless produced the conveyances, and other related documents. So she was
not prepared to assume that resolutions in relation to acquisition had existed.
That was entirely a matter for her, and cannot come close to legal error.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Court of Appeal in substance adopted Ouseley J’s
reasoning.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court, Mr Edwards QC for LCC accepts that this issue was one of
fact for the inspector. But he submits that her conclusion was unsupportable on
the evidence before her, or was vitiated by error of fact (under the principles
set out in <i>E v Secretary of State for Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/49.html">[2004] QB 1044</a>).
For good measure he submits that the courts below were wrong not to admit
evidence, discovered after the inquiry, in the form of council minutes from
February 1948 recording the resolution to acquire Areas A and B (and E) for a
“proposed primary school”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He starts from the proposition that the LCC, as a statutory local
authority, could only acquire land “for the purposes of any of their [statutory]
functions …” (see now the Local Government Act 1972, section 120(1)(a)); and
that in normal circumstances the land would continue to be held for the purpose
for which it was acquired unless validly appropriated for an alternative
statutory purpose, when no longer required for the first (section 122). The
inspector, he says, gave no weight to that statutory context.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As regards Areas A, B and E, he submits, the evidence before the
inspector was quite clear (even without the new evidence). The inspector
properly noted that the acquisition had been “Recorded in the books of the
Ministry of Education under section 87(3) of the Education Act 1944”. However,
she failed to understand or give due weight to the significance of that note.
As Mr Edwards explains, the effect of section 87 of the Education Act 1944
(headed “Exemption of assurances of property for educational purposes from the
Mortmain Acts”) was to exempt from the Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act 1888
and related Acts, land transferred (inter alia) to a local education authority,
if the land was to be used for educational purposes. (The law of Mortmain
dating back to the Statutes of Mortmain in 1279 and 1290, was not finally
abolished until 1960.) A copy of the conveyance or other document by which the
transfer of such land was made was required, within six months of its taking
effect, to be sent to the Education Minister. Section 87(3) provided that a
record should be kept of any conveyance sent to the minister pursuant to the
section. Accordingly, says Mr Edwards, the reference to the record under
section 87(3) should have been treated by the inspector as clear evidence that
the original purpose of the acquisition was for educational purposes, even in
the absence of a contemporary resolution to that effect. Against that
background, the lack of evidence of any competing purpose to which the land
might have been appropriated over the subsequent years pointed to the inference
that it continued to be held for its original purpose.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>As regards Areas C and D, Mr Edwards submits, the indication on the 1961
conveyance of an educational purpose, taken with the references in later
documents to its being treated as educational land, and the lack of any
evidence of a competing purpose, were sufficient to support the inference, on
the balance of probabilities, that education was the purpose for which it had
been acquired and subsequently held.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>Although Mr Edwards has accepted that this issue was one of fact for the
inspector, that concession needs to be seen in context. The inspector’s
assessment was one depending, not so much on evaluation of oral evidence, but
largely on the inferences to be drawn from legal or official documents of
varying degrees of formality.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our view, Ouseley J’s approach to the natural inferences to be drawn
from the material before the inspector was correct, but he was wrong to be
deflected by deference to the inspector’s fact-finding role. The main
difference between them was in the weight given by the inspector to the absence
of specific resolutions, from which she found it “not possible to be sure” that
the land had been acquired and held for educational purposes. On its face the
language appears to raise the threshold of proof above the ordinary civil test
to which she had properly referred earlier in the decision. But even
discounting that point, she was wrong in our view to place such emphasis on the
lack of such resolutions. Her task was to take the evidence before her as it
stood, and determine, on the balance of probabilities, for what purpose the
land was held. On that approach, Ouseley J’s own assessment (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1238.html">[2016] EWHC 1238 (Admin)</a>) was in our view impeccable. The inspector’s assessment was irrational,
having regard to the relevant standard of proof and the evidence available.
There was no evidence to support any inference other than that each part of the
land had been acquired for, and continued during the relevant period to be held
for, statutory educational purposes. An assessment made without any supporting
evidence cannot stand: <i>Edwards v Bairstow </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1955/3.html">[1956] AC 14</a>, 29.</p>

</span>In respect of Areas A and B, furthermore, there was a clear error of
law, in the inspector’s failure to appreciate, or take account of, the
significance of the reference to section 87(3) of the 1944 Act. This may be
because she was given little assistance on the point by LCC at the inquiry. It
is less clear why the point, having been clearly raised in submissions in the
court proceedings (see Ouseley J, para 44), seems to have been ignored in the
subsequent judgments. On any view, that reference, and the inferences to be
drawn from it, went beyond a pure issue of fact, and were appropriate for
review by the court. In agreement with Mr Edwards we would regard it as
providing unequivocal support for the conclusion that the land comprising Areas
A and B was acquired for educational purposes. There was no evidence to suggest
that it had ever been appropriated to other purposes.</a></p><a name="para33">

</span>In respect of Areas C and D, the evidence is less clear-cut, but we
agree with Mr Edwards’ submission that it is sufficient, on the balance of
probabilities, to support the same conclusion and that, in the absence of any
evidence to support any other view, it was irrational for the inspector to
reach a different conclusion. Again, we think that Ouseley J’s assessment of
the facts was the correct one.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>In these circumstances it is unnecessary to consider whether Ouseley J
erred in refusing to admit the new evidence. We note, however, that it does no
more than support what was already a strong case in respect of Areas A and B;
it does nothing to enhance the case for Areas C and D.</a></p><a name="para35">

</span>We can also deal more briefly with an issue that arises only in respect
of the Surrey site: that is Mr Laurence QC’s application for permission to
argue (for the first time) that the public’s use of the land for recreation
should be treated as having implied permission from NHS Property Services or
its predecessors, thus showing that the use was “by right” rather than “as of
right”. This, as he accepts, is a departure from <i>Sunningwell </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/28.html">[2000] 1 AC 335</a>, where it was held that mere toleration by a landowner of the public’s use
could not be taken as evidence that the landowner had impliedly consented to
that use. He seeks to distinguish the position of land that is held for public
purposes such as by his client. We quote his printed case:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… there is a critical distinction
between (i) a private owner (such as the kindly rector in <i>Sunningwell</i>)
tolerating use of land not held for public purposes - which can provide no
evidence of an implied permission - and (ii) a public owner passively
responding to recreational use in a statutory context which justifies the
inference that that response to the public’s use of the land is evidence of an
implicit permission so long as the permitted use does not disrupt the public
authority’s use of the land for its statutory purposes. In such a case it is
irrelevant that in a non-statutory, private context such a response might be
characterised as toleration.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He also relies on section 120(2) of the Local Government Act 1972, which
authorises land acquired by agreement by a local authority for a particular
purpose to be used, pending its requirement for that purpose, for any of the
authority’s functions, which, he submits, would include recreational use. It
can be inferred, accordingly, that any use by the public was permitted under
that power, and as such was pursuant to the same kind of public law right,
derived from statute, as was held in <i>R (Barkas) v North Yorkshire County
Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/31.html">[2014] UKSC 31</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/31.html">[2015] AC 195</a> (“<i>Barkas</i>”) and <i>Newhaven</i>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This submission seems to us to face two major difficulties. The first is
that no such claim was made before the inspector. As he recorded:</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“174(f)&nbsp; No issue arises on ‘as of
right’. There were no vitiating features in play which would preclude use as of
right and the application land was at no time held by SCC [Surrey County
Council] or by any of the various NHS bodies mentioned herein for purposes
which conferred an entitlement on members of the public to use the land for
informal recreation. For instance, there was no evidence of any overt act or
acts on the part of the objector, or its predecessor, to demonstrate that,
before January 2013, the landowner was granting an implied permission for local
inhabitants to use the wood.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In answer to this, Mr Laurence asserts that the issue is
one of law rather than fact. Even if that were so, it would in our view be
unfair to all those who took part in the five-day inquiry in 2015 to allow the
point to be taken for the first time four years later in this court.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, his main difficulty is that the submission is contradicted by
clear authority. In <i>R (Beresford) v City of Sunderland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/60.html">[2003] UKHL 60</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/60.html">[2004] 1 AC 889</a> Lord Walker had accepted the emphasis placed by Mr Laurence
himself (appearing on that occasion for the supporters of registration) on “the
need for the landowner to do something” (para 78); “passive acquiescence” could
not be treated “as having the same effect as permission communicated (whether
in writing, by spoken words, or by overt and unequivocal conduct)” (para 79).
Later in the judgment (para 83) Lord Walker accepted that permission might be
“implied by (or inferred from) overt conduct of the landowner, such as making a
charge for admission, or asserting his title by the occasional closure of the
land to all-comers”, but he found no evidence in that case of “overt acts (on
the part of the city council or its predecessors)” justifying the inference of
an implied licence.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nothing in <i>Barkas </i>or <i>Newhaven </i>undermines the principle
that passive acquiescence is insufficient. Mr Laurence’s then submission that
the land-owner must “do something” remains good law, even if there has been
some qualification of the form of communication required to the public. The
existence in each case of an overt act of the owner was emphasised in the
majority judgment in <i>Newhaven </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a>, para 71:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this case, as in <i>Barkas</i>,
the legal position, binding on both landowner and users of the land, was that
there was a public law right, derived from statute, for the public to go onto
the land and to use it for recreational purposes, and therefore, in this case,
as in <i>Barkas</i>, the recreational use of the land in question by
inhabitants of the locality was ‘by right’ and not ‘as of right’. The fact that
the right arose from an act of the landowner (in <i>Barkas</i>, acquiring the
land and then electing to obtain ministerial consent to put it to recreational
use; in this case, to make the Byelaws which implicitly permit recreational
use) does not alter the fact that the ultimate right of the public is a public
law right derived from statute (the Housing Act 1936 in <i>Barkas</i>; the 1847
Clauses Act and the 1878 Newhaven Act in this case).”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The law remains, as submitted by Mr Laurence in <i>Beresford</i>,
that passive acquiescence, even by a statutory authority with power to permit
recreational use, is not enough.</p>

</span>In the judgment of the majority (given by Lord Neuberger PSC and Lord
Hodge JSC) the decision not to confirm the registration was supported by two
separate lines of reasoning: implied permission and statutory incompatibility.
Although the latter was unnecessary for the decision, it was clearly identified
as a separate ground of decision (para 74). Lord Carnwath was alone in basing
his decision on the implied permission issue alone (para 137), seeing
“considerable force” in the contrary reasoning on the latter issue of Richards
LJ in the Court of Appeal (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/276.html">[2014] QB 186</a>). No-one has argued that we should
regard the majority’s reasoning on this issue as other than binding.
Accordingly our decision in the present case depends to a large extent on the
correct analysis of that reasoning, and its application to the facts of the two
cases before us.</p>

</span>The operation of Newhaven Harbour had been subject to legislation since
at least 1731. At the relevant time the governing statutes included (inter
alia) the Newhaven Harbour and Ouse Lower Navigation Act 1847, section 49 of
which required the trustees to -</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“maintain and support the said
harbour of Newhaven, and the piers, groynes, sluices, wharfs, mooring berths,

<p class="ParaNoNumber">and section 33 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses
Act 1847, which provided that, subject to payment of rates -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the harbour, dock and pier

</span>The land owned by the harbour company (“NPP”) included an area known as
West Beach, described in the judgment as “part of the operational land of the
Harbour” (para 8), although not currently used for any harbour purpose. As the
judgment explained, at para 9:</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Beach owes its origin to the
fact that, in 1883, pursuant to the powers granted by the 1863 Newhaven Act,
the substantial breakwater was constructed to form the western boundary of the
Harbour. The breakwater extends just over 700 metres out to sea. After the
construction of the breakwater, accretion of sand occurred along the eastern
side of the breakwater, and that accretion has resulted in the Beach.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following an application by the Newhaven Town Council to register the Beach
as a town or village green, and the holding of a public inquiry, it was found
by the inspector that the beach had been used by residents of the locality for
well over 80 years (save during the war periods) for recreation. On that basis
the registration authority resolved to register the land. That decision was
subject to an application for judicial review, which succeeded before Ouseley
J, but was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Their decision was in turn
reversed by the Supreme Court.</a></p><a name="para46">

<p class="ParaHeading">The judgment of this court in Newhaven</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the part of their judgment directed to the statutory incompatibility
issue, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge referred to case law on public rights of
way, easements and servitudes by way of analogy, adopting a cautious approach
(paras 76-90). Nonetheless, they found it did provide guidance. In English law,
public rights of way are created by dedication by the owner of the land, and
the legal capacity of the landowner to dedicate land for that purpose is a
relevant consideration (para 78, referring in particular to <i>British
Transport Commission v Westmorland County Council </i>[1958] AC 126; see also
para 87). Similarly, in the English law of private easements, the capacity of
the owner of the potential servient tenement to grant an easement is relevant
to prescriptive acquisition, which is based on the fiction of a grant by that
owner (para 79). The law of Scotland with respect of creation of public rights
of way and private servitudes had also developed on the footing that the
statutory capacity of a public authority landowner to allow the creation of
such rights was a relevant matter. In particular, in <i>Magistrates of
Edinburgh v North British Railway Co </i>(1904) 6 F 620, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/scot/cases/ScotCS/1904/41SLR0492.html">[1904] SLR 41_492</a> it was held that it was
not possible that a public right of way “which it would be ultra vires to grant
can be lawfully acquired by user” (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a>, paras 83-84); and in <i>Ellice’s
Trustees v Comrs of the Caledonian Canal </i>(1904) 6 F 325, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/scot/cases/ScotCS/1904/41SLR0260.html">[1904] SLR 41_260</a> it was held that
the commissioners of the canal did not have the power to grant a right of way
which was not compatible with the exercise of their statutory duties, and that
this also meant that no private right of way or servitude could arise by virtue
of user of the land over many years by those claiming such a right of way
(paras 85-86). Although the Scots law of prescription had been reformed by
statute, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge still regarded the historic position as
instructive. Their discussion of English law and Scots law in respect of
dedication and prescription at paras 76-90 is significant for present purposes,
because the reasoning in the cases in those areas regarding statutory
incompatibility is general, and is not dependent on the narrower rule of
statutory construction that a general provision does not derogate from a
special one (generalia specialibus non derogant), to which they also later
referred by way of analogy.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There follows the critical part of the majority judgment, under the
heading “Statutory incompatibility: statutory construction”, the material parts
of which we should quote in full, at paras 91-96:</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have said, the
rules of prescriptive acquisition apply only by analogy because Parliament in
legislating for the registration of town and village greens has chosen similar
wording (indulging ‘as of right’ in lawful sports and pastimes) in the 1965 and
2006 Acts. It is, none the less, significant in our view that historically in
both English law and Scots law, albeit for different reasons, the passage of
time would not give rise to prescriptive acquisition against a public
authority, which had acquired land for specified statutory purposes and
continued to carry out those purposes, where the user founded on would be
incompatible with those purposes. That approach is also consistent with the
Irish case, <i>McEvoy v Great Northern Railway Co</i> [1900] 2 IR 325, (Palles
CB at pp 334-336), which proceeded on the basis that the acquisition of an
easement by prescription did not require a presumption of grant but that the
incapacity of the owner of the servient tenement to grant excluded
prescription.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case if the
statutory incompatibility rested only on the incapacity of the statutory body
to grant an easement or dedicate land as a public right of way, the Court of
Appeal would have been correct to reject the argument based upon
incompatibility because the 2006 Act does not require a grant or dedication by
the landowner. But in our view the matter does not rest solely on the vires of
the statutory body but rather on the incompatibility of the statutory purpose
for which Parliament has authorised the acquisition and use of the land with
the operation of section 15 of the 2006 Act.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of
incompatibility is one of statutory construction. It does not depend on the
legal theory that underpins the rules of acquisitive prescription. The question
is: ‘does section 15 of the 2006 Act apply to land which has been acquired by a
statutory undertaker (whether by voluntary agreement or by powers of compulsory
purchase) and which is held for statutory purposes that are inconsistent with
its registration as a town or village green?’ In our view it does not. Where
Parliament has conferred on a statutory undertaker powers to acquire land
compulsorily and to hold and use that land for defined statutory purposes, the
2006 Act does not enable the public to acquire by user rights which are
incompatible with the continuing use of the land for those statutory purposes.
Where there is a conflict between two statutory regimes, some assistance may be
obtained from the rule that a general provision does not derogate from a special
one (generalia specialibus non derogant), which is set out in section 88 of the
code in <i>Bennion, Statutory Interpretation</i>, 6th ed (2013), p 281:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘Where the literal meaning of a
general enactment covers a situation for which specific provision is made by
another enactment contained in an earlier Act, it is presumed that the
situation was intended to continue to be dealt with by the specific provision
rather than the later general one. Accordingly the earlier specific provision
is not treated as impliedly repealed.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">While there is no question of
repeal in the current context, the existence of a lex specialis is relevant to
the interpretation of a generally worded statute such as the 2006 Act.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an
incompatibility between the 2006 Act and the statutory regime which confers
harbour powers on NPP to operate a working harbour, which is to be open to the
public for the shipping of goods etc on payment of rates: section 33 of the
1847 Clauses Act. NPP is obliged to maintain and support the Harbour and its
connected works (section 49 of the 1847 Newhaven Act), and it has powers to
that end to carry out works on the Harbour including the dredging of the sea
bed and the foreshore: section 57 of the 1878 Newhaven Act, and articles 10 and
11 of the 1991 Newhaven Order.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para48">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration of the
Beach as a town or village green would make it a criminal offence to damage the
green or interrupt its use and enjoyment as a place for exercise and recreation
- section 12 of the Inclosure Act 1857 … - or to encroach on or interfere with
the green - section 29 of the Commons Act 1876 … See the <i>Oxfordshire</i>
case </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/25.html">[2006] 2 AC 674</a>, per Lord Hoffmann, at para 56.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, which
concerns a working harbour, it is not necessary for the parties to lead
evidence as to NPP’s plans for the future of the Harbour in order to ascertain
whether there is an incompatibility between the registration of the Beach as a
town or village green and the use of the Harbour for the statutory purposes to
which we have referred. Such registration would clearly impede the use of the
adjoining quay to moor vessels. It would prevent the Harbour authority from
dredging the Harbour in a way which affected the enjoyment of the Beach. It
might also restrict NPP’s ability to alter the existing breakwater. All this is
apparent without the leading of further evidence.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">We discuss this reasoning in detail below.</p>

</span>Finally in this part of the majority judgment reference is made to cases
in which registration of land held by public bodies had been approved by the
court: <i>New Windsor</i>, the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case and <i>Lewis</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/11.html">[2010] 2 AC 70</a>. The treatment of these cases by Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge is also
significant for present purposes. As regards <i>New Windsor</i>, they
emphasised that the land was not “acquired and held for a specific statutory
purpose”, so “[n]o question of statutory incompatibility arose” (para 98). They
observed that in the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case, though the land was wanted for
use as an access road and housing development “there was no suggestion that
[the city council] had acquired and held the land for specific statutory
purposes that might give rise to a statutory incompatibility” (para 99). With
respect to <i>Lewis </i>they pointed out that “[it] was not asserted that the
council had acquired and held the land for a specific statutory purpose which
would be likely to be impeded if the land were to be registered as a town or
village green”; hence “[a]gain, there was no question of any statutory
incompatibility” (para 100).</p>

</span>In relation to each of these cases, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge
referred in entirely general terms to the statutory powers under which a local
authority might hold land and were at pains to emphasise that the land in
question was not in fact held in exercise of any such powers which gave rise to
a statutory incompatibility. That was the basis on which they distinguished the
cases. It is clearly implicit in this part of their analysis that they
considered that land which was acquired and held by a local authority in
exercise of general statutory powers which were incompatible with use of that
land as a town or village green could not be registered as such.</a></p><a name="para50">

</span>Their discussion concludes, at para 101:</a></p><a name="para51">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In our view, therefore, these
cases do not assist the respondents. The ownership of land by a public body,
such as a local authority, which has statutory powers that it can apply in
future to develop land, is not of itself sufficient to create a statutory
incompatibility. By contrast, in the present case the statutory harbour
authority throughout the period of public user of the Beach held the Harbour
land for the statutory harbour purposes and as part of a working harbour.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Incompatibility - the case for the appellants</p>

</span>For LCC Mr Edwards submits that the decision in <i>Newhaven </i>is of
general application to land held by a statutory authority for statutory
purposes, whatever the nature of the Act. He points out that the statutory
duties or powers in <i>Newhaven</i> were not specific to the beach itself, but
rather applied to all of the land acquired and held, from time to time, by NPP
and its predecessors for the operation of the Port. NPP had not, within living
memory, used the Beach for its statutory harbour purposes. The critical passage
in the majority judgment (para 93) refers generally to land -</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“which has been acquired by a
statutory undertaker (whether by voluntary agreement or by powers of compulsory
purchase) and which is held for statutory purposes …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is not limited to statutory powers directed to a
specific location or undertaking. No one has argued that the principle is
limited to statutory undertakers, as opposed to public authorities in general.
Nor is there any requirement for the land to be in actual use for statutory
purposes at the point of registration; it simply has to be held for such
purposes. In <i>Newhaven</i> the Beach had not been used for harbour purposes
nor was there any fixed intention to do so at any particular time in the future
(see para 96).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, notwithstanding the inspector’s findings, there
was, he submits, clear incompatibility with LCC’s functions in respect of the
land. The effect of registration would be that there accrues a right vested in
the inhabitants of Scotforth East Ward to use the land for lawful sports and
pastimes of a variety of forms, including walking and dog walking. LCC could
not restrict their entry onto the land, including Area B which was at the time
of the inspector’s decision used as a playing field by the school (see Decision
Letter, para 10). Given the statutory safeguarding obligations towards primary
school pupils, the use of that area for play could not continue. Any use of the
land to provide a new or expanded school would be precluded. In substance, the
land would be no longer available in any meaningful sense for use in fulfilment
of the LCC’s statutory duties as local education authority.</a></p><a name="para53">

</span>Mr Laurence makes similar submissions in respect of the Surrey site,
supported in that case by the conclusions of Gilbart J </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/611.html">[2017] 4 WLR 130</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our judgment, the appeals should be allowed in both cases. On a true
reading of the majority judgment in <i>Newhaven </i>on the statutory
incompatibility point, the circumstances in each of these cases are such that
there is an incompatibility between the statutory purposes for which the land
is held and use of that land as a town or village green. This has the result
that the provisions of 2006 Act are, as a matter of the construction of that
Act, not applicable in relation to it.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principle stated in the key passage of the majority judgment at para
93 is expressed in general terms. The test as stated is not whether the land
has been allocated by statute itself for particular statutory purposes, but
whether it has been acquired for such purposes (compulsorily or by agreement)
and is for the time-being so held. Although the passage refers to land
“acquired by a statutory undertaker”, we agree with Mr Edwards that there is no
reason in principle to limit it to statutory undertakers as such, nor has that
been argued by the respondents. That view is supported also by the fact that
the majority felt it necessary to find particular reasons to distinguish cases
such as <i>New Windsor</i>, the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case and <i>Lewis</i>,<i> </i>all
of which involved local authorities rather than statutory undertakers.
Accordingly, the appellants argue with force that the test is directly
applicable to the land acquired and held for their respective statutory
functions.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reference in para 93 to the manner in which a statutory undertaker
acquired the land is significant. Acquisition of land by a statutory undertaker
by voluntary agreement will typically be by the exercise of general powers
conferred by statute on such an undertaker, where the land is thereafter held
pursuant to such powers rather than under specific statutory provisions framed
by reference to the land itself (as happened to be a feature of the provisions
which were applicable in <i>Newhaven </i>itself). That is also true of land
acquired by exercise of powers of compulsory purchase. In relation to the
latter type of case, the majority said in terms that “the 2006 Act does not
enable the public to acquire by user rights which are incompatible with the
continuing use of the land for those statutory purposes” (para 93). On our
reading of the majority judgment, it is clear that in relation to both types of
case Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge took the view that an incompatibility
between general statutory powers under which land is held by a statutory
undertaker (or, we would add, a public authority with powers defined by
statute) and the use of such land as a town or village green excludes the
operation of the 2006 Act.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This interpretation of the judgment is reinforced by the analysis it
contains of the English and Scottish cases on dedication and prescription in
relation to rights of way, easements and servitudes and the guidance derived
from those cases (see paras 76 to 91): para 47 above. It is also reinforced by
the way in which Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge distinguished the <i>New Windsor</i>,
<i>Trap Grounds</i> and <i>Lewis </i>cases: paras 49 and 50 above.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents in these appeals submit that the reasoning of Lord
Neuberger and Lord Hodge is more narrowly confined, and depends upon
identifying a conflict between a particular regime governing an area of land
specified in the statute itself and the general statutory regime in the 2006
Act. In support of this interpretation the respondents point to the highly
specific nature of the statutory provisions governing the relevant land in <i>Newhaven</i>
and to the reference in para 93 to the rule of statutory construction that a
general provision does not derogate from a special one (generalia specialibus
non derogant).</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, for the reasons we have set out above, this interpretation of
the judgment does not stand up to detailed analysis. Lord Neuberger and Lord
Hodge stated only that “some assistance” could be obtained from consideration
of that rule of construction, not that it provided a definitive answer on the issue
of statutory incompatibility. In other words, they treated it as a helpful
analogy for the purposes of seeking guidance to answer the question they posed
in para 93, just as they treated the English and Scottish cases on prescriptive
acquisition as helpful. The way in which they posed the relevant question in
para 93 shows that their reasoning is not limited in the way contended for by
the respondents, as does their discussion of the prescriptive acquisition cases
and the local authority cases of <i>New Windsor</i>, <i>Trap Grounds</i> and <i>Lewis</i>.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We do not find the construction of the 2006 Act as identified by the
wider reasoning of the majority in <i>Newhaven </i>surprising. It would be a
strong thing to find that Parliament intended to allow use of land held by a
public authority for good public purposes defined in statute to be stymied by
the operation of a subsequent general statute such as the 2006 Act. There is no
indication in that Act, or its predecessor, that it was intended to have such
an effect.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann in <i>Sunningwell</i> concluded that it could be inferred
that Parliament intended to allow for the creation of new rights pursuant to
the 1965 Act by reason of the “public interest in the preservation of open
spaces which had for many years been used for recreational purposes”, but in
doing so he recognised that “[a] balance must be struck” between rights
attaching to private property and competing public interests of this character
(p 359B-E). It is natural to expect that where a public authority is holding
land for public purposes defined by statute which are incompatible with the
public interest identified by implication from the 1965 Act, and now the 2006
Act, that balance will be affected. The proper inference as to Parliament’s
intention is that the general public interest identified by Lord Hoffmann will
in such a case be outweighed by the specific public interest which finds
expression in the particular statutory powers under which the land is held.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge appreciated, this general point can be
made with particular force in relation to land purchased using compulsory
purchase powers set out in statute. Such powers are generally only created for
use in circumstances where an especially strong public interest is engaged,
such as could justify the compulsory acquisition of property belonging to
others. It seems highly unlikely that Parliament intended that public interests
of such a compelling nature could be defeated by the operation of the general
provisions in the 2006 Act.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In construing the 2006 Act it is also significant that it contains no
provision pursuant to which a public authority can buy out rights of user of a
town or village green arising under that Act in relation to land which it
itself owns. That is so however strong the public interest may now be that it
should use the land for public purposes. Since in such a case the public
authority already owns the land, it cannot use any power of compulsory purchase
to eradicate inconsistent rights and give effect to the public interest, as
would be possible if the land was owned by a third party. Although section 16
of the 2006 Act makes specific provision for “deregistration” of a green on
application to the “appropriate national authority”, in relation to land which
is more than 200 square metres in area the application must include a proposal
to provide suitable replacement land: subsections (2), (3) and (5). This
procedure is available to any owner of registered land, public or private; it
is not designed to give effect to the public interest reflected in specific
statutory provisions under which the land is held. Often it will be impossible
in practice for a public authority to make a proposal to provide replacement
land as required to bring section 16 into operation. Again, it would be
surprising if Parliament had intended to create the possibility that the 2006
Act should in this way be capable of frustrating important public interests
expressed in the statutory powers under which land is held by a public
authority, when nothing was said about that in the 2006 Act.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our view, applying section 15 of the 2006 Act as interpreted in the
majority judgment in <i>Newhaven</i>, LCC and NHS Property Services can show
that there is statutory incompatibility in each of their respective cases. As
regards the land held by LCC pursuant to statutory powers for use for education
purposes, two points may be made. First, so far as concerns the use of Area B
as a school playing field, that use engages the statutory duties of LCC in
relation to safeguarding children on land used for education purposes. LCC has
to ensure that children can play safely, protected from strangers and from
risks to health from dog mess. The rights claimed pursuant to the registration
of the land as a town or village green are incompatible with the statutory
regime under which such use of Area B takes place. Secondly, however, and more
generally, such rights are incompatible with the use of any of Areas A, B, C or
D for education purposes, including for example construction of new school
buildings or playing fields. It is not necessary for LCC to show that they are
currently being used for such purposes, only that they are held for such
statutory purposes (see <i>Newhaven</i>, para 96). The 2006 Act was not
intended to foreclose future use of the land for education purposes to which it
is already dedicated as a matter of law.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similar points apply in the Surrey case. Although the non-statutory
inspector found against the appellant on the statutory incompatibility issue,
the registration authority failed to consider it. Gilbart J was satisfied that,
within the statutory regime applicable in that case, there was no feasible use
for health related purposes, and indeed none had been suggested. The Court of
Appeal took a different view, but largely, as we understand it, on the basis
that recreational use of the subject land would not inhibit the ability of NHS
Property Services to carry out their functions on other land. We consider that
Gilbart J was correct in his assessment on this point. The issue of
incompatibility has to be decided by reference to the statutory regime which is
applicable and the statutory purposes for which the land is held, not by
reference to how the land happens to be being used at any particular point in
time (again, see <i>Newhaven</i>, para 96).</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Lady Arden and Lord Wilson take a different view regarding the effect
of the majority judgment in <i>Newhaven</i>, we should briefly explain why,
with respect, we are not persuaded by their judgments. We are all in agreement
that the outcome of these appeals turns upon the proper interpretation of the
majority judgment in <i>Newhaven</i>. We cannot accept their interpretation of
that judgment.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our view, although the case might have been decided on narrower
grounds, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge deliberately posed the relevant question
in para 93 in wide terms, specifically in order to state the issue as one of
statutory incompatibility as a matter of principle, having regard to the proper
interpretation of the relevant statute pursuant to which the land in question
is held. That is why the heading for the relevant section of their judgment is
“Statutory incompatibility: statutory construction”. They say in terms in para
93, “The question of incompatibility is one of statutory construction.” Nowhere
do they say it is a matter of statutory construction <i>and</i> an evaluation
of the facts regarding the use to which the land has been put. According to
their judgment, the issue of incompatibility is to be determined as a matter of
principle, by comparing the statutory purpose for which the land is held with
the rights claimed pursuant to the 2006 Act, not by having regard to the actual
use to which the authority had put the land thus far or is proposing to put it
in future. We consider that this emerges from the critical para 93, and also
from the paragraphs which follow in their judgment.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in para 94 they identify the relevant incompatibility as that
between the 2006 Act and “the statutory regime which confers harbour powers on
NPP to operate a working harbour”. In para 96, it is to that statutory
incompatibility that they refer, not to incompatibility with any use to which
NPP had as yet put the land in question or might in fact put it in the
foreseeable future. As a matter of fact, the Beach had not been used for the
applicable statutory purposes. Further, in our opinion, by stating in para 96
that it was not necessary for the parties to lead evidence as to NPP’s plans
for the future of the harbour “in order to ascertain whether there is an
incompatibility between the registration of the Beach as a town or village
green and the use of the Harbour for the statutory purposes to which we have
referred”, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge were seeking to emphasise, contrary to
Lady Arden’s and Lord Wilson’s interpretation of their judgment, that what
matters for statutory incompatibility to exist so as to prevent the application
of the 2006 Act is a comparison with the relevant statutory powers under which
the land is held, not any factual assessment of how the public authority might
in fact be using or proposing to use the land.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same point can be made about para 97, where Lord Neuberger and Lord
Hodge said that it was unnecessary to consider evidence about actual proposed
use of the land on the facts, since they were able to determine by looking at
the statutory powers “that there is a clear incompatibility between NPP’s
statutory functions in relation to the Harbour, which it continues to operate
as a working harbour [ie to hold under the statutory powers referred to in para
94], and the registration of the Beach as a town or village green”. Their
discussion at paras 98 to 100 of <i>New Windsor</i>, the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case
and <i>Lewis</i> supports the same conclusion. In each of those cases the
relevant land had been held for a very long period without actually being put
to use which was inconsistent on the facts with use as a town or village green
and without any proposal that it should be put to such use. The implication
from what Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge say about them is that if it had been
shown that the land was held for specific statutory purposes which were
incompatible with registration under the 2006 Act, that would have constituted
statutory incompatibility which would have prevented registration. Their
treatment of these cases cannot be reconciled with Lady Arden’s and Lord
Wilson’s proposed interpretation of their judgment. We do not think that para
101 can be reconciled with that proposed interpretation either. In that
paragraph Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge contrast a case in which a public body
might have statutory purposes to which it could in future appropriate the land
(but has not yet done so) with the situation in <i>Newhaven </i>itself, where
in the relevant period NPP held the Beach “for the statutory harbour purposes
and as part of a working harbour” (ie under the statutory regime referred to in
para 94). In our view they were there emphasising that what matters for a
statutory incompatibility defence to arise is that the land in question should
be held pursuant to statutory powers which are incompatible with registration
as a town or village green. Nor, with respect, do we think that Lady Arden and
Lord Wilson have offered any good answer to the points we have made at paras 61
to 64 above.</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We also consider that the reading of <i>Newhaven </i>proposed by Lady
Arden and Lord Wilson would undermine the very clear test which Lord Neuberger
and Lord Hodge plainly intended to state. Instead of focusing on the question
of the incompatibility of the statutory powers under which the relevant land is
held, Lady Arden and Lord Wilson would introduce an additional factual inquiry
into the actual use to which the authority is putting the land or proposes to
put the land in the foreseeable future. Thus, Lady Arden and Lord Wilson would
adopt from the English case of <i>Westmorland </i>[1958] AC 126<i> </i>a test
of what use could reasonably be foreseen for the land in question, even though
Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge say nothing to support that in the relevant part
of their judgment. They refer to both English and Scottish cases on
prescriptive acquisition as being relevant to their assessment of the correct
approach to be adopted in interpreting the 2006 Act, and in each case only by
way of broad analogy, as they explain at para 91. The Scottish cases they cite
do not employ any such test as in the <i>Westmorland</i> case and are
consistent with the clear principled test, based on statutory construction,
which we understand Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge to have laid down.</a></p><a name="para71">

</span>Finally, for completeness, we should mention briefly an issue which does
not strictly arise within the scope of the appeals, but has been the subject of
some discussion. That is the question whether, notwithstanding registration,
there might be scope for use by the appellants of the land for their statutory
purposes. This arises from a suggestion put forward in Lord Carnwath’s minority
judgment in <i>Newhaven</i>. He noted that in the <i>Trap Grounds </i>case it
had not been necessary to consider the potential conflict between the general
village green statutes and more specific statutory regimes, such as under the
Harbours Acts. He said, at para 139:</a></p><a name="para72">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is at least arguable in my
view that registration should be confirmed if the necessary use is established,
but with the consequence that the 19th century restrictions are imported
subject only to the more specific statutory powers governing the operation of
the harbour.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Edwards, supported by Mr Laurence, seeks to build on that tentative
suggestion, taken with the principle of “equivalence” adopted in the <i>Lewis </i>case
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/11.html">[2010] 2 AC 70</a>. As he submits, the Supreme Court accepted that there should be
equivalence between the use of the land for lawful sports and pastimes in the
qualifying period (in that case subject to concurrent use as a golf course) and
the extent of rights vested in local inhabitants after registration. That
approach was taken a stage further by the Court of Appeal in <i>TW Logistics
Ltd v Essex County Council </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2172.html">[2019] Ch 243</a>, holding that the 19th century
statutes, as applied to a registered modern green, are not to be construed as
interfering with the rights of the landowner to continue pre-existing uses so
far as not inconsistent with the uses which led to registration (per Lewison
LJ, paras 63-82).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74">74.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is not a suitable occasion to examine the scope of the principle of
equivalence, so far as it can be relied on to protect existing uses by the
landowner. <i>Lewis </i>was a somewhat special case. Lord Brown was able to
draw on “[his] own experience both as a golfer and a walker for over six
decades” (para 106) to attest to the feasibility of an approach based on “give
and take” in that particular context. The same approach may not be so easy to
apply in other contexts, and as applied to other forms of competing use.
Permission has been granted for an appeal to this court in <i>TW Logistics</i>.
That may, if the appeal proceeds, provide an opportunity for further
consideration of this difficult issue. In any event, those cases were concerned
with actual uses by the owners, not with potential uses for statutory purposes
for which the land is held, as in the present cases.</a></p><a name="para74">

</span>In view of our conclusion that the land in each appeal should not have
been found to be capable of being registered under the Act, the issue of what

</span>My views differ from those of Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales on these
appeals in an important respect. My conclusion is that the question of
incompatibility between two sets of statutory provisions (on this appeal, the
provisions of the Commons Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) and the statute authorising
the holding of land by the public authority in question) involves an assessment
of the facts as well as a proposition of law. The fact that a public authority
holds land for statutory purposes which are incompatible with the use of the
land as a town or village green (“TVG”), is not of itself&nbsp; sufficient to make
the land incapable of being registered under the 2006 Act as a TVG. It must be
shown that the land is in fact also being used pursuant to those powers, or
that it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used pursuant to those
powers, in a manner inconsistent with the public’s rights on registration as a
TVG. That requirement in my judgment follows from <i>R (Newhaven Port &amp; Properties
Ltd) v East Sussex County Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html">[2015] AC 1547</a>. References in this judgment
to public authorities exclude public authorities which are subject to a
statutory duty to carry out a particular function on specified land, identified
by statute, where such land is sought to be registered as a TVG. Such
authorities are outside the scope of this judgment.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Identifying the correct approach to questions of
statutory inconsistency</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of constitutional principle, courts must approach the
statute book on the basis that it forms a coherent whole. That means that, when
interpreting legislation, courts must, in the absence of an indication of some
other intention by Parliament, strive to ensure that the provisions work
together and apply so far as possible to their fullest extent, such extent
being judged according to the intention of Parliament demonstrated principally
in the words used. (We have not been shown any other admissible evidence as to
Parliament’s intention, such as ministerial statements in Hansard.) The courts
cannot simply decline to enforce parts of a statute because there may be a
conflict with some other statute. It has to be shown that the part sought to be
disapplied is irreconcilable with another part of it. If the two can stand
together there is no statutory irreconcilability or inconsistency: compare, for
example, <i>The Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v Knight </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1892/27.html">[1892] AC 298</a>. One statute cannot be said to be incompatible with another if the two
statutes can properly be read together. So, the test is: can the two statutes
in question properly be interpreted so that they stand together and each has
the fullest operation in the sense given above?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79">79.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Newhaven</i>, as I shall demonstrate by reference to the majority
judgment in that case in the next section of this judgment, the point was that
there was a risk that the statutory undertaking’s working harbour would be
stymied in its operations if the Beach was held to be a TVG. It was not a case
where a statutory authority has acquired land for a statutory purpose but, at
the time of the proposed registration as a TVG, it is not likely that the land
will be used for that purpose in the reasonably foreseeable future.</a></p><a name="para79">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Newhaven and the limits of this Court’s decision in
that case</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judgments in <i>Newhaven</i> in my judgment should be approached on
the basis that they are consistent with the principles explained in para 78
above, even though the members of this Court in that case did not articulate
them. This court should read their decision, if this can properly be done as a
matter of statutory interpretation, as leading to the result that where public
authority ownership of land and registration as a TVG can co-exist, that course
will be available. As a matter again of constitutional principle, land should
not be relieved of the burden of an Act of Parliament having (so far as
relevant) unqualified application if there is an alternative, properly
available interpretation which will lead to the two enactments in question
standing together.</a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On timing, the question whether there is any conflict between public
authority powers and TVG legislation must be determined as at the date when the
application for registration is made. At that point in time, the public authority
may be holding land it has acquired under statutory powers for a particular
purpose for which it is not yet required. It is not required to apply the land
for that purpose and it may decide not to do so and for example to sell the
land or use it for some other purpose. Moreover, even while holding the land
for a particular purpose, the local authority may be using it for another
purpose because it is not required for the statutory purpose for which it is
appropriated at that point in time (Local Government Act 1972, section 120(2)).</a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81"></a><a name="para82">82.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The factual scenario in <i>Newhaven</i> was different: the harbour
company was already in operation and the beach was liable to be involved in its
then current trading operations. The case shows that incompatibility is not a
purely legal matter depending on the existence of statutory powers which if
exercised would be inconsistent with use of the land as a TVG. It is necessary
on the facts to be satisfied that that is likely to occur after registration.
It requires a real-world assessment of the situation. The court is not
precluded from looking at the facts subsequent to the acquisition of the land
any more than the determination as to the reasonableness of a landlord’s
refusal to give a consent under a lease is restricted to the facts known to the
parties at the date of the lease (see <i>Ashworth Frazer Ltd v Gloucester City
Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/59.html">[2001] 1 WLR 2180</a>).</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Interpreting the decision of this Court in Newhaven</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83">83.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <i>Newhaven</i> case, the harbour company (“NPP”) had a statutory
duty to maintain a harbour. The dispute concerned a tidal beach in one part of
the harbour which as it happened was no longer operational. The Beach had been
used for the past 80 years or so by members of the locality. The issue with
which these appeals are concerned is the issue in that case as to whether the Beach
could be registered as a TVG. This court held that the land in issue, namely
the Beach, could not be registered as a TVG.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Newhaven</i>, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge jointly gave the
leading judgment. The other members of the Supreme Court agreed with them. Lord
Carnwath also wrote a concurring judgment. On these appeals, Lord Carnwath and
Lord Sales examine the leading judgment in detail. They conclude that Lord
Neuberger and Lord Hodge held that, where a person applies to register as a TVG
land which is held for statutory purposes which would be inconsistent with the
land also being TVG, the land is not capable of being so registered, and that
the question is purely one of statutory construction. Thus, Lord Neuberger and
Lord Hodge formulated the relevant question as, at para 93:</a></p><a name="para84">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“does section 15 of the 2006 Act
apply to land which has been acquired by a statutory undertaker (whether by
voluntary agreement or by powers of compulsory purchase) and which is held for statutory
purposes that are inconsistent with its registration as a town or village
green?”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84"></a><a name="para85">85.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having stated that question, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge immediately
answered it by the following sentence: “In our view it does not.” In that
sentence, the word “it”, as I read it, refers to section 15 itself.</a></p><a name="para85">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next sentence in the judgment of Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge
states (also at para 93):</a></p><a name="para86">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where Parliament has conferred on
a statutory undertaker powers to acquire land compulsorily and to hold and use that
land for defined statutory purposes, the 2006 Act does not enable the public to
acquire by user rights which are incompatible with the continuing use of the
land for those statutory purposes.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That sentence makes it clear that Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge regarded
“use” as a critical issue. That clearly involves fact. Moreover, the expression
“continuing use” also makes it clear that they regarded the operations of NPP
as constituting use which was being perpetuated and that that was so even
though the tidal beach which was in issue was in a part of the harbour which
was not itself being used.</a></p><a name="para87">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is further clear from that sentence, in my judgment, that the Supreme
Court was not considering the question what would happen if the relevant use
had never started or if the relevant land had become surplus to the obligation
or power to carry out any particular activity which had been imposed by
Parliament. We have not been shown any statutory requirement that a public
authority should regularly consider the need for any land and if thought fit
dispose of land which is not required for some purpose for which it was
acquired, so it may end up holding land for which it has no further need.</a></p><a name="para88">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"></a><a name="para89">89.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The local authority could voluntarily appropriate the land to some other
purpose but, if it fails to reconsider the use for which it acquired land, or
appropriates it to some other use, it is likely that the only basis on which
the local authority’s decision or omission to act could be challenged would be
on the basis that its decision attained the standard of irrationality, which is
a high standard for an applicant to have to meet. Under the judgment of Lord
Carnwath and Lord Sales, that land would remain immune from the accrual of
rights leading to registration as a TVG even though there would not in fact be
any irreconcilability between registration and the statutory power for which
the land was conferred. It is not clear what on this basis would happen if the
local authority accepts that the original purpose is spent and after the
application is made decides to appropriate the land to some other statutory
purpose.</a></p><a name="para89">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, in <i>Newhaven</i>, para 96, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge
held:</a></p><a name="para90">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><strong><span style="background:
white;font-weight:normal">“96</span></strong><span style="background:white">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
this case, which concerns a working harbour, it is not necessary for the
parties to lead evidence as to NPP’s plans for the future of the Harbour in
order to ascertain whether there is an incompatibility between the registration
of the Beach as a town or village green and the use of the Harbour for the
statutory purposes to which we have referred. Such registration would clearly
impede the use of the adjoining quay to moor vessels. It would prevent the
Harbour authority from dredging the Harbour in a way which affected the
enjoyment of the Beach. It might also restrict NPP’s ability to alter the
existing breakwater. All this is apparent without the leading of further
evidence.”</span></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that they regarded it as important that the harbour in
question was a “working harbour” and that there was a risk of a clash between
the registration of the Beach and the use of the harbour for the statutory
purposes. They considered that registration would inhibit the use of the
adjoining quay to moor vessels. It would prevent the harbour authority from
dredging the harbour in a way which affected the enjoyment of the Beach and
restrict its ability to alter the existing breakwater. So, I deduce from that
paragraph that Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge also regarded it as important that
there was factual evidence establishing the continuing use and the impact of registration
on that use. There had to be real, not theoretical, incompatibility.</a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge continue at the end of that paragraph to
observe:</a></p><a name="para92">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“All this is apparent without the
leading of further evidence.”</p>

</span>The word “further” confirms that the preceding analysis involved a
consideration of the evidence on the ground. In fact the further evidence
appears to have been evidence as to plans to upgrade the harbour and use it as
a container terminal: see the judgment of Ouseley J in <i>R (Newhaven Port &amp;
Properties Ltd) v East Sussex County Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/647.html">[2012] 3 WLR 709</a>, para 127.</p>

</span>In para 97, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge continue by summarising
further matters on which the harbour company relied, but it was not necessary
in the light of the conclusion in para 96 to consider those matters. It is to
be noted that in para 97, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge refer to an
incompatibility between the proposed TVG registration and the statutory
functions of NPP, which they add:</a></p><a name="para94">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“continues to operate as a working
harbour”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This is an express reference to the state of fact. It
would clearly have been material if the harbour company held the land but had
ceased its statutory functions.</p>

</span>In paras 98 to 101, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge refer to previous
leading cases to show that the question of statutory incompatibility had not
previously had to be considered. But, importantly for my interpretation, they
conclude that (at para 100):</a></p><a name="para95">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span style="background:white">“It
was not asserted that the council had acquired and held the land for a specific
statutory purpose which would be likely to be impeded if the land were to be
registered as a town or village green.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><span style="background:white">So, in a case concerned
with future use, the court must consider if the statutory purpose would be
“likely” to be impeded, not likely to be impeded if invoked. Lord Neuberger and
Lord Hodge clearly envisaged that there would have to be a factual inquiry as
to future use and that it would have to be shown that TVG registration would be
likely to impede the exercise of those powers. Lack of impediment can logically
be shown either by showing that the local authority has acquired the land for
purposes (eg recreational purposes) which are not inconsistent with
registration as a TVG, or by showing that there is no realistic likelihood of
the land being used for the purposes for which it was acquired.</span></p>

</span>In addition, at para 101 of their judgment, Lord Neuberger and Lord
Hodge held:</a></p><a name="para96">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><strong><span style="background:

our view, therefore, these cases do not assist the respondents. The ownership
of land by a public body, such as a local authority, which has statutory powers
that it can apply in future to develop land, is not of itself sufficient to
create a statutory incompatibility. By contrast, in the present case the
statutory harbour authority throughout the period of public user of the Beach
held the Harbour land for the statutory harbour purposes and as part of a
working harbour.”</span></p>

</span>In that paragraph, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge addressed the question
of a future development of the land. The mere power to undertake such development
would not itself be sufficient to create a statutory incompatibility. They
contrasted that with the position in the <i>Newhaven</i> case. Lord Neuberger
and Lord Hodge again referred to the evidence that the tidal beach was part of
the working harbour.</a></p><a name="para97">

</span>For the avoidance of doubt, I agree that this court should apply
statutory incompatibility, the concept sought to be employed in <i>Newhaven</i>,
to determine the question of inconsistency between the provisions of the 2006
Act enabling registration of land in issue on these appeals as TVGs and the
statutory provisions, also conferred by public general Acts of Parliament,
empowering the acquisition and holding of land by the public authorities in
both appeals. However, in my judgment, that concept is as a matter of
constitutional principle to be interpreted as I have explained in para 78

analysis of <i>Newhaven </i>detailed above does not lead to any different
conclusion in relation to those Areas from that reached by Lord Carnwath and
Lord Sales. I would accept the submission of Mr Douglas Edwards QC, for
Lancashire County Council, that in practice the land could not be used by the
primary school currently using it when there was unrestricted public access as
this would not be consistent with the school’s safeguarding obligations: this
may be inferred from the fact that the site is currently fenced. Schools are
responsible for creating and maintaining a safe environment for their pupils.

the House of Lords in <i>British Transport Commission v Westmorland County
Council </i>[1958] AC 126, in which a railway company contended that it would
have been inconsistent with the statutory powers conferred on it for the public
to have a right of way over a bridge spanning the railway line (originally
built for private benefit) and that accordingly its predecessor (another
statutory company) could not have dedicated it to the public. In <i>Newhaven</i>,
Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge cited the judgment of Lord Keith of Avonholm in
this case as authority for the proposition that incompatibility with an Act of
Parliament is a question of fact, at para 87:</a></p><a name="para104">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In <i>British Transport
Commission </i>[1958] AC 126, 164-165 Lord Keith of Avonholm commented on Lord
Kinnear’s opinion in <i>Magistrates of Edinburgh</i>, suggesting that it would
be going too far to hold that the public could never acquire a right of way
over railway property but acknowledging that incompatibility with the conduct
of traffic on the railway could bar a public right of passage. He opined at p

undertaker to prove incompatibility.”</p>

</span>The other members of the House also treated it as a question of fact
(see Viscount Simonds at p 144, Lord Morton of Henryton at p 149, Lord
Radcliffe at p 156, Lord Cohen at p 163 and Lord Keith at p 166). Moreover,
they held that, to show compatibility, it was not necessary to show that there
were no circumstances in which a conflict could arise. That would make it
impossible for members of the public ever to acquire a public right of way over
land belonging to the railway company. The House also rejected the argument
that a statutory company could not grant an easement over a footpath over its
railway. To hold otherwise “would be a grave impediment to public amenity” (per
Lord Radcliffe at p 153). It was unlikely on the facts that the railway company
would ever need to pull the bridge down.</a></p><a name="para105">

</span>The relevant question was whether a conflict, or incompatibility, was
reasonably foreseeable. Thus, Viscount Simonds (at p 144), Lord Morton (at p
149) and Lord Keith (see p 166) rejected the following test: was it <i>possible</i>
that land would be used in future for a certain purpose? They considered that
the normal statutory burden should apply and be discharged, namely that it
should be shown that the use was reasonably likely to occur.</a></p><a name="para106">

</span>The House considered the question on a current basis and did not decide
whether the critical time was the date of dedication or some other date (see
for example pp 144-145). At all events it did not seek to determine the
question as at the date of the incorporation of the statutory company when its
statutory powers were conferred.</a></p><a name="para107">

</span>In my judgment, the test of reasonable foreseeability is the correct
test also to apply in this context, ie when asking whether there is
incompatibility between registration of land as a TVG and the statutory powers
of a public authority in relation to the same land where the relevant use that
the public authority might make of the land under those powers is a potential
future use which has not yet started.</a></p><a name="para108">

</span>It is said by Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales that this test is not clear.
It may not be easy to apply on the facts but that is necessarily so if the law
applies a solution which is fact-dependent rather than drawing a bright line as
the majority does. Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge refer to the <i>Westmorland </i>case
at two points in their judgment. In the light of their conclusion that the
evidence as to current use was sufficient it was not necessary for them to
consider it in any further detail, but they would not have cited it if they did
not approve of its approach. If I am right there is no question of the use of
land being stymied by the 2006 Act (cf para 61 above). Circumstances may have
moved on and the public authority may no longer require the land it is holding
for any particular statutory purpose.</a></p><a name="para109">

</span>The issue of future use of the land arises on the Lancashire appeal in
relation to Areas C and D. The local authority in the Lancashire appeal did not
adduce evidence that it was reasonably likely that these Areas would be used
for educational purposes in the future. There had in the past been a plan to
relocate a school on this area but that was not proceeded with and there was no
substitute. Moreover, those Areas had never been used for educational purposes.
Accordingly, as I see it, those plots should have been registered as a village
green. The only objection to doing so was one of statutory incompatibility and
as I see it, that fails on the facts.</a></p><a name="para110">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110"></a><a name="para111">111.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The position is different in relation to Areas A and B which are
currently used for educational purposes. Importantly, as I read the facts, the
sites cannot be registered as TVGs and be school playgrounds at the same time
for the reason that this would be inconsistent with the school’s safeguarding
duty. The school has an obligation to provide outdoor space as a playground
under regulation 10 of the School Premises (England) Regulations 2012, and that
is its current use. The inspector did not reach any conclusion on the question
of the compatibility in fact of the current use of Areas A and B with their
registration as TVGs, and she expressly left open the door to further evidence
on incompatibility.</a></p><a name="para111">

</span>In the Surrey appeal, the result is different because the site in issue
lies immediately next to the hospital. On the basis of my judgment, the correct
legal test applying to future use was not applied. There have been no findings
of fact as to whether it is reasonably foreseeable that even now the land will
be used for the statutory purposes for which it is currently held. In those
circumstances, in my judgment, this matter should be remitted to the
registration authority for a decision on that issue.</a></p><a name="para112">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Restrictions on TVG registration in the Growth and

</span>Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales begin their judgment with an analysis of
the development of the law on TVGs since the report of the Royal Commission on
Common Land 1955-1958 (1958) (Cmnd 462), chaired by Sir Ivor Jennings QC, which
led to the Commons Registration Act 1965. Undoubtedly that Act and its
successor, the 2006 Act, have led to the registration of TVGs at a more
significant level than can have been envisaged by the Royal Commission.</a></p><a name="para113">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para113"></a><a name="para114">114.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, it is now an inescapable fact that the actual use of the
TVG legislation has, in the light of practical experience and the needs and
expectations of local communities up and down the country, eclipsed the
original conception of a more limited role for TVG registration. The clock
cannot be turned back.</a></p><a name="para114">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para114"></a><a name="para115">115.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Parliament has essentially given its approval to that use in
later legislation. The Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 (“the 2013 Act”)
introduced a package of measures designed to restore the balance between the
public and landowners but retaining the same basic system of registration.</a></p><a name="para115">

</span>The three main changes brought about by the 2013 Act in this connection
can be summarised, and it will be seen that they were substantial:</a></p><a name="para116">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The period within
which a person may apply to register land as a TVG after the landowner has
terminated the use by members of the public without permission has been reduced
from three years to one year (2006 Act, section 15(3A) as amended).</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2013 Act has
inserted a new section 15C into the 2006 Act terminating the public’s right to
apply to register land as a town or village green after any one of a range of
“trigger events” occurs. These include an application for planning permission.
The right to apply for registration as a TVG will arise again if a “terminating
event” occurs, namely (in the case of an application for planning permission)
the planning application is withdrawn, is refused or expires, or the local
planning authority (“LPA”) does not determine it. (Where the planning
application is for a project of public importance under section 293A of the
Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the right to make an application to
register as a TVG does not arise where the LPA declines to determine it.)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landowners have a
new right to deposit statements with the appropriate registration authority
with respect to any land and this will have the effect of terminating any
existing or accruing rights to register that land as a TVG (2006 Act, section
15A, as amended). Landowners already had a right to apply to deregister land as
a TVG, but comparable land must be offered in exchange (2006 Act, section 16).</p>

</span>Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales are right to say that these changes are not
directly relevant, and there is no information about any fall in the number of
TVG registrations. However, these changes are important. It is open to public
authorities to take advantage of these changes (and this is my core answer to
the points that Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales make in para 64 above). They show,
among other matters, that Parliament did not consider that there should be some
special exemption applying in respect of all publicly-held land. That may be a
recognition of the fact that public bodies may be holding land which is surplus
to their statutory requirements. While many statutes confer a power on
statutory bodies to acquire and hold land, we have not been shown any provision
requiring the body on which the power is conferred to sell it when it becomes
clear that the land is not required or is no longer required for the purpose
for which it was acquired. If a public authority took no action to dispose of
land it did not need, it might well be difficult to obtain judicial review of
its action as irrationality may have to be shown.</a></p><a name="para117">

</span>Moreover, Parliament took no steps in the 2013 Act to revise the
conditions for registration for TVGs.</a></p><a name="para118">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Judgment of Lord Wilson</b></p>

</span>Since circulating the first draft of my judgment I have had the benefit
of reading the judgment of Lord Wilson. He agrees with the approach of the
Court of Appeal [2018] 2 P &amp; CR 15. I have great admiration for his
judgment and that of Lindblom LJ, with which Jackson and Thirlwall LJJ agreed.
In particular, I agree with the three general points made by Lindblom LJ in
para 36 of his judgment. In a sense my approach might be described as a halfway
house between their judgments and that of Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales. The ten
judges who have considered the issues on these appeals have unfortunately been
very divided. For my own part, I do not consider that the view of the Court of
Appeal addresses the effect on incompatibility of the possibility of future use
of the sites sought to be registered as TVGs, or the intention of Parliament in
such cases. However, if I am wrong on the approach I have taken, I would adopt
that of Lord Wilson and the Court of Appeal in preference to that of Lord
Carnwath and Lord Sales. Respectfully, their approach results in introducing
into the legislation a blanket exemption for public authorities which Parliament
has not itself expressly given. Parliament has instead provided all landowners
with other measures which they can use to protect their position for the
future.</a></p><a name="para119">

</span>Limiting the issue of incompatibility to a “desktop” exercise of
considering the statutory powers of the landowner, without reference to the
facts on the ground, runs the risk, to borrow Lord Radcliffe’s words in <i>British
Transport Commission</i> at p 153, of “a grave impediment to public amenity.”
There will potentially be a loss of access by the public to land which they
have used for very many years.</a></p><a name="para120">

</span>My approach to statutory incompatibility in my judgment strikes a fairer
balance between the public interest in the use of land by the public authority
for the appropriated statutory purpose and that of the public who are intended
by the 2006 Act to have a right of access to recreational spaces than the
approach of Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales. That is my principal answer to the
points which they make in paras 61 to 64 and 67 to 71 above and my other
responses to those paragraphs appear from this judgment. My judgment does not
as suggested in any way involve frustrating the intention of Parliament since
the statutory powers under which the public authority holds the land will
prevail if it is shown that there is a current use of the land in exercise of
those powers, or that it is reasonably foreseeable that such use will occur (se
para 77 above).</a></p><a name="para121">

</span>It is agreed that, in their capacity as education authorities, local
authorities, such as the appellant in the Lancashire case, can hold land only
for specified statutory purposes referable to education; that health
authorities, such as the appellant in the Surrey case, can hold land only for specified
statutory purposes referable to health; and that, for example, in their
capacity as housing authorities, local authorities can hold land only for
specified statutory purposes referable to housing.</a></p><a name="para125">

</span>If public authorities which hold land for specified statutory purposes
are to be immune from any registration of it as a green which would be
theoretically incompatible with their purposes, the reach of section 15 of the
Commons Act 2006 Act is substantially reduced. One would expect that, had such
been its intention, Parliament would have so provided within the section. In
the absence of any such provision, whence does justification for it come?</a></p><a name="para126">

</span>It comes, according to today’s ruling, from the decision of this court
in the <i>Newhaven</i> case, cited in para 1 above, from which the court would
in any event be able to depart if necessary. In my view interpretation of that
decision by today’s majority is controversial. The claim in para 11 above that
their interpretation represents no more than consolidation of the law is
unfortunately not one to which I can subscribe.</a></p><a name="para127">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para127"></a><a name="para128">128.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The decision in the <i>Newhaven</i> case wrought an exception to the
availability of registration under section 15. It is always dangerous to
interpret an exception too widely lest it becomes in effect the rule and the
rule becomes in effect the exception.</a></p><a name="para128">

</span>In the <i>Newhaven</i> case statutes had cast upon the harbour
authority, as the owner/operator of the port, specific <i>duties</i> in
relation to <i>that particular harbour</i>; and the operational land of that
harbour included that particular beach. An Act of 1847 obliged the authority to
maintain and support that harbour. An Act of 1878 obliged it to keep that
harbour open to all for the shipping and unshipping of goods and the embarking
and landing of passengers. Incidental to these obligations were statutory
powers, including one in an instrument of 1991 to dredge the foreshore of that
harbour. Were it to exercise its power to dredge the area of the foreshore to
the east of the breakwater, the authority would destroy the beach.</a></p><a name="para129">

</span>It is therefore no surprise to read within the joint judgment of Lord
Neuberger and Lord Hodge emphasis on the statutory duties cast upon the
authority in relation to that particular harbour; no surprise that, in the
opening paragraph they described the relevant point of principle as “the
interrelationship of the statutory law relating to village greens and other <i>duties</i>
imposed by statute” (emphasis supplied); and no surprise that, at the outset of
the crucial paragraph (namely para 93, set out in para 48 above), in which they
set out their reason for allowing the appeal on the relevant point, they
stated:</a></p><a name="para130">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The question of incompatibility

</span>What did Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge mean by “statutory construction”?
They meant conflict between two statutory regimes. They explained in the same
paragraph that, where such conflict existed,</a></p><a name="para131">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… some assistance may be obtained
from the rule that a general provision does not derogate from a special one …,

p 281:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘Where the literal meaning of a
general enactment covers a situation for which specific provision is made by
another enactment contained in an earlier Act, it is presumed that the situation
was intended to continue to be dealt with by the specific provision rather than
the later general one.’”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the next paragraph they proceeded to explain that the
specific duties conferred by statutes on the authority in relation to that
harbour were incompatible with the general provision in the 2006 Act which, on
the face of it, permitted registration of the beach as a green and that
therefore the general provision had to give way.</p>

</span>By contrast, statutory provisions which confer power to acquire and hold
land, not there identified, for educational and health purposes, such as are in
play in the present appeals, cannot be said to be incompatible with the general
provision in the 2006 Act which, on the face of it, permits registration of the

issue was whether villagers in the fenlands were obliged to repair a road. If
it had been dedicated as a public highway, they were obliged to do so. The land
on which the road had been constructed was owned by commissioners who had
bought it pursuant to statutory powers to drain specified fens and to keep them
drained. They had constructed drains on it and, with the excavated earth, had
built a wide bank which the villagers had used as a highway for more than 20
years. In the Court of King’s Bench the villagers contended that any dedication
by the commissioners of the road as a public highway would have been
inconsistent with their powers. On behalf of the majority Parke J, later Lord
Wensleydale, made clear that the contention should be addressed by means of a
practical inquiry on the ground. He said at p 480:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The question then is reduced to
this, whether, upon the finding of the jury in this case, the public use of the
bank as a road would interfere with the exercise of these powers?”</p>

</span>The <i>Leake</i> case demonstrates that for almost 200 years the law of
England and Wales in relation to the capacity of a public authority to dedicate
its land as a public highway, or indeed as a public footpath, has been to
assess its alleged incompatibility with the statutory purposes for which the
land is held on a practical, rather than a theoretical, basis.</a></p><a name="para137">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para137"></a><a name="para138">138.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Such is made clear in the Opinions of the appellate committee of the
House of Lords in <i>British Transport Commission v</i> <i>Westmorland County
Council </i>[1958] AC 126, cited in para 71 above. A railway company was
authorised by statute to buy land in Kendal for the purposes of operating a
railway and to build bridges across it where necessary. On one of its bridges
it built a footpath, which the public had used for more than 20 years. The
question was whether, in the light of the limited statutory purposes for which
it could hold land, the company could have dedicated the footpath as a public
highway. Applying the <i>Leake</i> case, the appellate committee held that the
answer was to be found by determining whether the use of the footpath by the
public was incompatible with the statutory purposes; that incompatibility was a
question of fact (p 143); that the test was pragmatic (p 152); that the
question was not whether it was conceivable but whether it was reasonably
foreseeable that the public use of the footpath would interfere with the
company’s use of its land in the exercise of its powers for the statutory
purposes (p 144); that the burden lay on the company to establish that it was
reasonably foreseeable (p 166); and that, by reference to the case stated by
the local justices, the company failed to discharge that burden.</a></p><a name="para138">

</span>In para 78 of their judgment in the <i>Newhaven</i> case Lord Neuberger
and Lord Hodge explained the decision in the <i>Westmorland</i> case. In paras
77 and 91 they stressed that, like other decisions which they examined and
which related to the acquisition of prescriptive rights under English and Scots
law, the decision applied only by analogy to the statutory registration of a
green on land owned pursuant to statutory purposes.</a></p><a name="para139">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para139"></a><a name="para140">140.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, in a case in which the objection to registration as a
green is cast as incompatibility with statutory purposes, there is in my view
every reason to assess incompatibility in accordance with the approach adopted
in the <i>Leake</i> case and indorsed in the <i>Westmorland</i> case.</a></p><a name="para140">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para140"></a><a name="para141">141.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am convinced that in the <i>Newhaven</i> case such was also the view
of Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge, and indeed of Lady Hale and Lord Sumption who
agreed with them. I refer to four passages in the joint judgment.</a></p><a name="para141">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, from para 91:</a></p><a name="para142">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is … significant in our view
that historically in both English law and Scots law, albeit for different
reasons, the passage of time would not give rise to prescriptive acquisition
against a public authority, which had acquired land for specified statutory
purposes <i>and continued to carry out those purposes</i>, where the user
founded on would be incompatible with those purposes.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para142"></a><a name="para143">143.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, from the crucial para 93:</a></p><a name="para143">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where Parliament has conferred on
a statutory undertaker powers to acquire land compulsorily and to hold and use
that land for defined statutory purposes, the 2006 Act does not enable the
public to acquire by user rights which are incompatible with the <i>continuing
use</i> of the land for those statutory purposes.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para143"></a><a name="para144">144.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Third, the whole of para 96:</a></p><a name="para144">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this case, which concerns a
working harbour, it is not necessary for the parties to lead evidence as to
[the authority’s] plans for the future of the Harbour in order to ascertain
whether there is an incompatibility between the registration of the Beach as a
town or village green and the use of the Harbour for the statutory purposes to
which we have referred. Such registration would clearly impede the use of the
adjoining quay to moor vessels. It would prevent the Harbour authority from
dredging the Harbour in a way which affected the enjoyment of the Beach. It
might also restrict [the authority’s] ability to alter the existing breakwater.
All this is apparent without the leading of further evidence.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And fourth, from para 101:</a></p><a name="para145">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The ownership of land by a public
body … which has statutory powers that it can apply in future to develop land,
is not of itself sufficient to create a statutory incompatibility. By contrast,
in the present case the statutory harbour authority throughout the period of
public user of the Beach held the Harbour land for the statutory harbour
purposes and <i>as part of a working harbour</i>.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para145"></a><a name="para146">146.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It thus seems clear from the <i>Newhaven</i> case that registration of
the beach as a green was there precluded as incompatible with the existing use
of the land as a working harbour; and that, in the absence of existing use of
the land, the public authority needs to adduce evidence. What evidence?
Evidence which makes it reasonably foreseeable that public use of the land as a
green would in practice interfere with a proposed exercise of the authority’s
powers in relation to the land for the statutory purposes.</a></p><a name="para146">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146"></a><a name="para147">147.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that I respectfully disagree with the suggestion in paras 65
and 66 of the judgment of Lord Carnwath and Lord Sales that incompatibility
with statutory purposes should be assessed as a theoretical exercise rather
than by means of a practical inquiry into interference with the authority’s
existing or proposed future use of the land.</a></p><a name="para147">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147"></a><a name="para148">148.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Adopting what I believe to be the correct, practical, approach to the
assessment of incompatibility in relation to the present appeals, I agree with
the Court of Appeal that neither the education authority nor the health
authority has established that public use of its land as a registered green
would be likely to be incompatible with its use of it pursuant to its statutory
powers. In the Lancashire case the Inspector conducted the requisite practical
assessment, which led her to reject the alleged incompatibility; and, like the
Court of Appeal, Ouseley J in the Administrative Court found no fault with her
reasoning. I discern no ground upon which this court might have concluded
otherwise. In the Surrey case the Inspector, while recommending refusal of the
application for a different reason later shown to be invalid, also rejected the
alleged incompatibility on apparently practical grounds; and the error of law
which Gilbart J in the Administrative Court perceived him to have made in
assessing it practically rather than as a matter of statutory construction was
in my view correctly held by the Court of Appeal to have been no error at all.</a></p><a name="para148">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para148"></a><a name="para149">149.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was with complete passivity that, for no less than 20 years, these
two public authorities contemplated the recreational use of their land on the
part of the public. Their simple erection at some stage during that period of
signs permitting (or for that matter prohibiting) public use would have
prevented such use of the land being as of right: <i>Winterburn v Bennett </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/482.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 482</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/482.html">[2017] 1 WLR 646</a>. In such circumstances it is hardly surprising
that they both failed to establish its practical incompatibility with their own
proposed use of it.</p>
