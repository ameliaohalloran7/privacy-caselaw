The Court of Appeal (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/489.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 489</a>), disagreeing with Hickinbottom J (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/442.html">[2017] EWHC 442 (Admin)</a>) in the High Court, held that, in granting planning permission for the extension of a quarry, the council had been misled by defective advice given by their planning officer. In the words of Lindblom LJ, giving the leading judgment:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It was defective, at least, in failing to make clear to the members that, under government planning policy for mineral extraction in the Green Belt in para 90 of the NPPF, visual impact was a potentially relevant and potentially significant factor in their approach to the effect of the development on the ‘openness of the Green Belt’, …” (para 49, per Lindblom LJ)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">He thought that, having regard to the officer’s own assessment, it was “quite obviously relevant”, and therefore a necessary part of the assessment. The court quashed the permission.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the council, supported by the quarry operator (the third respondent), argues that the Court of Appeal’s reasoning was based on misunderstandings both of the relevant policies and of the officer’s report, and that the permission should be reinstated. The first and second respondents (collectively referred to as “Samuel Smith”) seek to uphold the decision and reasoning of the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

It can be traced back to the first national guidance on Green Belts in Circular 42/55 (issued in August 1955). More recently Planning Policy Guidance 2: Green Belts (published in 1995 and amended in 2001) (“PPG2”) confirmed the role of Green Belts as “an essential element of planning policy for more than four decades”; and noted that the purposes of Green Belt policies and the related development control policies set out in 1955 “remain valid today with remarkably little alteration” (para 1.1). The NPPF itself, as appears from ministerial statements at the time, was designed to consolidate and simplify policy as expressed in a number of ministerial statements and guidance notes, rather than to effect major policy changes (see <i>Redhill Aerodrome Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/1386.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 1386</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/1386.html">[2015] PTSR 274</a>, paras 16ff, 22 per Sullivan LJ).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The extent to which the use of land fulfils these objectives is however not itself a material factor in the inclusion of land within a Green Belt, or in its continued protection. For example, although Green Belts often contain areas of attractive landscape, the quality of the landscape is not relevant to the inclusion of land within a Green Belt or to its continued protection. The purposes of including land in Green Belts are of paramount importance to their continued protection, and should take precedence over the land use objectives.” (para 1.7)</p>

By contrast, mineral extraction is not expressly subject to the proviso, but may be regarded as not inappropriate, subject only to “high environmental standards” and the quality of restoration. In the shortened version in the NPPF these categories of potentially appropriate development have been recast in para 90, and brought together under the same proviso, including the requirement to preserve openness.</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.122&nbsp; It is considered that the proposed development preserves the openness of the Green Belt and does not conflict with the purposes of including land within the Green Belt. Openness is not defined, but it is commonly taken to be the absence of built development. Although the proposed development would be on existing agricultural land, it is considered that because the application site immediately abuts the existing operational quarry, it would not introduce development into this area of a scale considered to conflict with the aims of preserving the openness of the Green Belt.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.123&nbsp; In terms of whether the proposed development does not conflict with the purposes of including land within the Green Belt, the proposed quarrying operations are not considered to conflict with the purposes of including land within the Green Belt. Equally, it is not considered that the proposed development would undermine the objective of safeguarding the countryside from encroachment as it should be considered that the site is in conjunction with an operational quarry which will be restored. The proposed development is a temporary use of land and would also be restored upon completion of the mining operations through an agreed [restoration plan].</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.124&nbsp; The purposes of including land within the Green Belt to prevent the merging of neighbouring towns and impacts upon historic towns are not relevant to this site as it is considered the site is adequately detached from the settlements of Stutton, Towton and Tadcaster.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.125&nbsp; As mentioned in the response from [Samuel Smith], one of the purposes of the Green Belt is assisting in urban regeneration which the objector claims will be undermined by the proposed development. Given the situation of the application site, adjacent to an existing operational quarry and its rural nature, and the fact that minerals can only be worked where they are found, it is considered that the site would not, therefore, undermine this aim of the Green Belt.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.126&nbsp; The restoration scheme is to be designed and submitted as part of a section 106 Agreement, it is considered that there are appropriate controls to ensure adequate restoration of the site.

The respective roles of the planning authorities and the courts have been fully explored in two recent cases in this court: <i>Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City Council (Asda Stores Ltd intervening)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/13.html">[2012] UKSC 13</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/13.html">[2012] PTSR 983</a>, and <i>Hopkins Homes Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/37.html">[2017] UKSC 37</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/37.html">[2017] 1 WLR 1865</a>. In the former Lord Reed, while affirming that interpretation of a development plan, as of any other legal document, is ultimately a matter for the court, also made clear the limitations of this process:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although a development plan has a legal status and legal effects, it is not analogous in its nature or purpose to a statute or a contract. As has often been observed, development plans are full of broad statements of policy, many of which may be mutually irreconcilable, so that in a particular case one must give way to another. In addition, many of the provisions of development plans are framed in language whose application to a given set of facts requires the exercise of judgment. Such matters fall within the jurisdiction of planning authorities, and their exercise of their judgment can only be challenged on the ground that it is irrational or perverse …” (para 19)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the <i>Hopkins Homes </i>case (paras 23-34) I warned against the danger of “over-legalisation” of the planning process. I noted the relatively specific language of the policy under consideration in the <i>Tesco </i>case, contrasting that with policies:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“expressed in much broader terms [which] may not require, nor lend themselves to, the same level of legal analysis …”</p>

It is naturally read as referring back to the underlying aim of Green Belt policy, stated at the beginning of this section: “to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open …”. Openness is the counterpart of urban sprawl and is also linked to the purposes to be served by the Green Belt. As PPG2 made clear, it is not necessarily a statement about the visual qualities of the land, though in some cases this may be an aspect of the planning judgement involved in applying this broad policy concept. Nor does it imply freedom from any form of development. Paragraph 90 shows that some forms of development, including mineral extraction, may in principle be appropriate, and compatible with the concept of openness. A large quarry may not be visually attractive while it lasts, but the minerals can only be extracted where they are found, and the impact is temporary and subject to restoration. Further, as a barrier to urban sprawl a quarry may be regarded in Green Belt policy terms as no less effective than a stretch of agricultural land.</a></p><a name="para22">

Most of the authorities to which we were referred were concerned with the scope of the exceptions for buildings in para 89 (or its predecessor). In that context it was held, unremarkably, that a building which was otherwise inappropriate in Green Belt terms was not made appropriate by its limited visual impact (see <i>R (Heath and Hampstead Society) v Camden London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/977.html">[2007] EWHC 977 (Admin)</a>, upheld at <i>R (Heath and Hampstead Society) v Vlachos</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/193.html">[2008] EWCA Civ 193</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/193.html">[2008] 3 All ER 80</a>).

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The loss of openness (ie unbuilt on land) within the Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land is of itself harmful to the underlying policy objective. If the replacement dwelling is more visually intrusive there will be further harm in addition to the harm by reason of inappropriateness …” (para 22)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">To similar effect, in the <i>Lee Valley </i>case, Lindblom LJ said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The concept of ‘openness’ here means the state of being free from built development, the absence of buildings - as distinct from the absence of visual impact.” (para 7, cited by him in his present judgment at para 19)</p>

This concerned an inspector’s decision refusing permission for a proposal to replace a mobile home and storage yard with a residential bungalow in the Green Belt. In rejecting the contention that it was within the exception for redevelopment which “would not have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt”, the inspector had expressly taken account of its visual effect, and that it would “appear as a dominant feature that would have a harmful impact on openness here”. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision. Sales LJ said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The concept of ‘openness of the Green Belt’ is not narrowly limited to the volumetric approach suggested by [counsel]. The word ‘openness’ is open-textured and a number of factors are capable of being relevant when it comes to applying it to the particular facts of a specific case. Prominent among these will be factors relevant to how built up the Green Belt is now and how built up it would be if redevelopment occurs … and factors relevant to the visual impact on the aspect of openness which the Green Belt presents.” (para 14)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Before us there was no challenge to the correctness of this statement of approach. However, it tells one nothing about how visual effects may or may not be taken into account in other circumstances. That is a matter not of legal principle, but of planning judgement for the planning authority or the inspector.</p>

That concerned an application for permission for an exploratory drill site to explore for hydrocarbons in the Green Belt, including plant and buildings. The inspector had considered the potential effect of the development on the Green Belt:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I consider Green Belt openness in terms of the absence of development. The proposal would require the creation of an extensive compound, with boundary fencing, the installation of a drilling rig of up to 35 metres in heating, a flare pit and related buildings, plant, equipment and vehicle parking on the site. Taking this into account, together with the related HGV and other traffic movements, I consider that the Green Belt openness would be materially diminished for the duration of the development and that there would be a conflict with Green Belt purposes in respect of encroachment into the countryside over that period.” (quoted by Ouseley J at para 16)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">He refused permission, taking the view that it did not fall within the exception for “mineral extraction”, and that there were no very special circumstances to out-weigh the harm to the Green Belt identified in that passage.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was held that he had erred in failing to treat the proposal as one for mineral extraction, and therefore potentially within the exception in NPPF para 90. Ouseley J noted the special status of mineral extraction under Green Belt policy. As he said:</a></p><a name="para27"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One factor which affects appropriateness, the preservation of openness and conflict with Green Belt purposes, is the duration of development and the reversibility of its effects. Those are of particular importance to the thinking which makes mineral extraction potentially appropriate in the Green Belt. Another is the fact that extraction, including exploration, can only take place where those operations achieve what is required in relation to the minerals. Minerals can only be extracted where they are found …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green Belt is not harmed by such a development because the fact that the use has to take place there, and its duration and reversibility are relevant to its appropriateness and to the effect on the Green Belt ...”</p>

Affirming his decision in the Court of Appeal, Richards LJ said (para 41):</a></p><a name="para28"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The key point, in my judgment, is that the inspector approached the effect on Green Belt openness and purposes on the premise that exploration for hydrocarbons was necessarily inappropriate development since it did not come within any of the exceptions. He was not considering the application of the proviso to para 90 at all: on his analysis, he did not get that far. Had he been assessing the effect on Green Belt openness and purposes from the point of view of the proviso, it would have been on the very different premise that exploration for hydrocarbons on a sufficient scale to require planning permission is nevertheless capable in principle of being appropriate development. His mind-set would have been different, or at least it might well have been different …”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Although the decision turned principally on a legal issue as to the meaning of “mineral extraction”, it is significant that the impact on the Green Belt identified by the inspector (including a 35 metre drill rig and related buildings) was not thought necessarily sufficient in itself to lead to conflict with the openness proviso. That was a matter for separate planning judgement.</p>

In summary Samuel Smith’s argument, upheld by the Court of Appeal, is that the authority erred in failing to treat the visual effects, described by the officer in her assessment of “Landscape impact” (para 17 above) as “material considerations” in its application of the openness proviso under para 90.</a></p><a name="para29">

I sought to summarise the principles in <i>Derbyshire Dales District Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/1729.html">[2009] EWHC 1729 (Admin)</a>; [2010] 1 P &amp; CR 19. The issue in that case was whether the authority had been obliged to treat the possibility of alternative sites as a material consideration. I said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one thing to say that consideration of a possible alternative site is a potentially relevant issue, so that a decision-maker does not err in law if he has regard to it. It is quite another to say that it is <i>necessarily</i> relevant, so that he errs in law if he fails to have regard to it …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the former category the underlying principles are obvious. It is trite and long-established law that the range of potentially relevant planning issues is very wide (<i>Stringer v Minister of Housing and Local Government</i> [1970] 1 WLR 1281); and that, absent irrationality or illegality, the weight to be given to such issues in any case is a matter for the decision-maker (<i>Tesco Stores Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment and West Oxfordshire District Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/22.html">[1995] 1 WLR 759</a>, 780). On the other hand, to hold that a decision-maker has erred in law by <i>failing</i> to have regard to alternative sites, it is necessary to find some legal principle which compelled him (not merely empowered) him to do so.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">He continued:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘What has to be emphasised is that it is only when the statute <i>expressly or impliedly identifies considerations required to be taken into account by the authority as a matter of legal obligation</i> that the court holds a decision invalid on the ground now invoked.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In approving this passage, Lord Scarman noted that Cook J had also recognised, that -</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘… in certain circumstances there will be some matters so obviously material to a decision on a particular project that anything short of direct consideration of them by the ministers … would not be in accordance with the intention of the Act.’ (<i>In re Findlay</i> at p 334)</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems, therefore, that it is not enough that, in the judge’s view, consideration of a particular matter might realistically have made a difference.

The question therefore is whether under the openness proviso visual impacts, as identified by the inspector, were expressly or impliedly identified in the Act or the policy as considerations required to be taken into account by the authority “as a matter of legal obligation”, or alternatively whether, on the facts of the case, they were “so obviously material” as to require direct consideration.</a></p><a name="para32">

He said:</a></p><a name="para33"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stress that we are here concerned with differential impact, ie the potential adverse visual impact over and above the adverse spatial impact. On the facts of this case … it is difficult to see what the potential visual impact of the development would be over and above the spatial impact, which, as Mr Village concedes, was taken into account. In any event, even if there were some such impact, that does not mean that openness would be adversely affected; because, in assessing openness, the officers would still have been entitled to take into account factors such as the purpose of the development, its duration and reversibility, and would have been entitled to conclude that, despite the adverse spatial and visual impact, the development would nevertheless not harm but preserve the openness of the Green Belt.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the potential visual impact of the development falls very far short of being an obvious material factor in respect of this issue. In my judgment, in the circumstances of this case, the report did not err in not taking into consideration any potential visual impact from the development. Indeed, on the facts of this case, I understand why the officers would have come to the view that consideration of visual impact would not have materially added to the overarching consideration of whether the development would adversely impact the openness of the Green Belt.”</p>

He summarised the visual impacts described by the officer:</a></p><a name="para34"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed development was a substantial extension to a large existing quarry, with a lengthy period of working and restoration. As the Principal Landscape Architect recognized in her response to consultation, and the officer acknowledged without dissent in her report, there would be permanent change to the character of the landscape (paras 4.109 and 4.115 of the report). The ‘quality of the Locally Important Landscape Area as a whole would be compromised’ (para 7.41). <i>The exposed face of the extended quarry would be as visible as that of the existing quarry, if not more so</i> (paras 4.111 and 7.42). <i>Long distance views could be cut off by the proposed bunding and planting</i>. Agricultural land would ultimately be replaced by a ‘deep lower level landscape’ of grassland (para 4.113). The ‘character and quality’ of the landscape would be ‘permanently changed’ and the ‘impact cannot be described as neutral’ (paras 4.115 and 7.44). Concluding her assessment of ‘Landscape Impact’, the officer was satisfied that the ‘proposed screening could protect the environment and residential receptors from potential landscape and visual impacts’, and that with the proposed mitigation measures the development would comply with national and local policy (paras 7.47 and 8.4).</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That assessment did not deal with the likely effects of the development on the openness of the Green Belt as such, either spatial or visual. <i>It does show, however, that there would likely be - or at least could be - effects on openness in both respects, including the closing-off of long distance views by the bunding and planting that would screen the working</i> (para 4.111 of the officer’s report). The officer’s conclusion overall (in para 7.47) was, in effect, that the proposed screening would be effective mitigation, without which the development would not be acceptable. But this was not followed with any discussion of the harmful effects that the screening measures themselves might have on the openness of the Green Belt.” (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is to para 7.122 that one must look, at least in the first place, to see whether the officer considered the relevance of visual impact to the effect of this development on the openness of the Green Belt. Did she confront this question, and bring the committee’s attention to it? I do not think she did. <i>She neither considered, in substance, the likely visual impact of the development on the openness of the Green Belt nor, it seems, did she ask herself whether this was a case in which an assessment of visual impact was, or might be, relevant to the question of whether the openness of the Green Belt would be preserved.</i> Indeed, <i>her observation that openness is ‘commonly taken to be the absence of built development’ seems deliberately to draw the assessment away from visual impact, and narrow it down to a consideration of spatial impact alone</i>. And the burden of the assessment, as I read it, is that because the further extraction of limestone would take place next to the existing quarry, the ‘scale’ of the development would not fail to preserve the openness of the Green Belt. This seems a somewhat surprising conclusion. But what matters here is that it is a consideration only of spatial impact. Of the visual impact of the quarry extension on the openness of the Green Belt, nothing is said at all.<i> That was, it seems to me, a significant omission, which betrays a misunderstanding of the policy in para 90 of the NPPF.</i></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One must not divorce para 7.122 from its context. The report must be read fairly as a whole. The question arises, therefore: did the officer address the visual impact of the development on the openness of the Green Belt in the remaining paragraphs of this part of her report, or elsewhere? I do not think she did. <i>Her consideration of the effects of the development on the ‘purposes of including land in the Green Belt’, in paras 7.123 to 7.125, is unexceptionable in itself. However, she did not, in these three paragraphs, revisit the question of harm to the openness of the Green Belt, either in spatial or in visual terms</i>. The conclusion to this part of the report, in para 7.126, is that the ‘character and openness of the Green Belt’ would not be materially harmed by the development - a conclusion repeated in para 8.5 - and that the proposal would therefore comply with Policy SP3 and Policy SP13 of the local plan and the NPPF. But I cannot accept that this conclusion overcomes the lack of consideration of visual impacts on ‘openness’ in the preceding paragraphs. It seems to treat ‘character’ as a concept distinct from ‘openness’. Even if these two concepts can be seen as related to each other, and however wide the concept of ‘character’ may be, there is no suggestion here that the officer was now providing a conclusion different from that in para 7.122, or additional to it.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same may also be said of the officer’s earlier discussion of ‘Landscape Impact’ in paras 7.41 to 7.47. Her assessment and conclusions in that part of her report are not imported into para 7.122, or cross-referred to as lending support to her conclusion there ...” (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only conclude, therefore, that the advice given to the committee by the officer was defective. It was defective, at least, <i>in failing to make clear to the members that, under government planning policy for mineral extraction in the Green Belt in para 90 of the NPPF, visual impact was a potentially relevant and potentially significant factor</i> in their approach to the effect of the development on the ‘openness of the Green Belt’, and hence to the important question of whether the proposal before them was for ‘inappropriate’ development in the Green Belt - and, indeed, in implying that the opposite was so … One can go further. <i>On the officer’s own assessment of the likely effects of the development on the landscape, visual impact was quite obviously relevant to its effect on the openness of the Green Belt.</i> <i>So the consideration of this question could not reasonably be confined to spatial impact alone.</i>” (Emphasis added)</p>

I find that a little surprising, since it was very similar to Lindblom LJ’s own observation in the <i>Lee Valley </i>case (para 23 above). It is also consistent with the contrast drawn by the NPPF between openness and “urban sprawl”, and with the distinction between buildings, on the one hand, which are “inappropriate” subject only to certain closely defined exceptions, and other categories of development which are potentially appropriate. I do not read the officer as saying that visual impact can never be relevant to openness.</a></p><a name="para40">

The whole of paras 7.121 to 7.126 of the officer’s report address the openness proviso and should be read together. Some visual effects were given weight, in that the officer referred to the restoration of the site which would be required. Beyond this, I respectfully agree with Hickinbottom J that such relatively limited visual impact which the development would have fell far short of being so obviously material a factor that failure to address it expressly was an error of law. For similar reasons, with respect to Mr Village’s additional complaint, I see no error in the weight given by the officer to the fact that this was an extension of an existing quarry. That again was a matter of planning judgement not law.</a></p><a name="para41">
