<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 29 April 2011
attracted vast public interest nationally and internationally. Managing the crowds
presented the Metropolitan Police with a big challenge. In giving the judgment
of the Administrative Court, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/1947.html">[2012] EWHC 1947 (Admin)</a>, Richards LJ explained
the nature of the policing operation, its command structure and planning, in
considerable detail. This was necessary because at the heart of the claims made
against the police in these proceedings was a broad challenge that the planning
and execution of the policing operation did not make proper allowance for the
democratic rights of anti-monarchist protestors to express their views in a
peaceable way. For present purposes, the background and circumstances giving
rise to the claims may be outlined more shortly.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The police were aware that on the day of the wedding a large number of
members of the Royal Family, foreign royalty and other heads of state would be
moving around London and that thousands of citizens including children were
expected to converge on central London to take part in the day’s celebrations.
One month earlier, on 26 March 2011, a day of action organised by the TUC had
been marred by the actions of outsiders who used the occasion to commit various
offences of violence. There had been similar violent disruption of student
protests in November and December 2010, including an attack on the Prince of
Wales’s car. In the build up to the royal wedding, the police had intelligence
that activities aimed at disrupting the celebrations were being planned through
social websites. The threat level from international terrorism at the time was
assessed as severe, meaning that an attempted attack was thought to be highly
likely. Thousands of police officers were deployed across the metropolis. The
strategic aims, as set out in briefing materials prepared by the “Gold
commander” with overall responsibility for the safe policing of the event,
included to “provide a lawful and proportionate policing response to protest,
balancing the needs and rights of protesters with those impacted by the
protest” and to “maintain public order”. The same aims were reflected in
tactical operational plans prepared by subordinate commanders.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The four appellants were part of a larger group of claimants, but it was
agreed before the Court of Appeal that their cases should be treated as test
cases. They were arrested in separate incidents at various places in central
London on the grounds that their arrest was reasonably believed by the
arresting officers to be necessary to prevent an imminent breach of the peace.
They were taken to four different police stations and later released without
charge, once the wedding was over and the police considered that the risk of a
breach of the peace had passed. Their periods of custody ranged from about 2½
hours to 5½ hours.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The power of the police, or any other citizen, to carry out an arrest to
prevent an imminent breach of the peace is ancient, but it remains as relevant
today as in times past. The leading domestic authorities on the subject are the
decisions of the House of Lords in <i>Albert v Lavin</i> [1982] AC 546 and <i>R
(Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Constabulary</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/55.html">[2007] 2 AC 105</a>. There are important safeguards for the citizen, in order to prevent breach
of the peace powers from becoming “a recipe for officious and unjustified
intervention in other people’s affairs” (in Lord Rodger’s words in <i>Laporte</i>,
at para 62). The essence of a breach of the peace is violence. The power to
arrest to prevent a breach of the peace which has not yet occurred is confined
to a situation in which the person making the arrest reasonably believes that a
breach of the peace is likely to occur in the near future (quoting again from
Lord Rodger in <i>Laporte</i>, at para 62). And even where that is so, there
may be other ways of preventing its occurrence than by making an arrest; there
is only a power of arrest if it is a necessary and proportionate response to
the risk.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Administrative Court rejected the broad complaint that the police
adopted an unlawful policy for the policing of the royal wedding. After close
examination of the facts of the individual arrests, it also held that the
arresting officers had good grounds to believe that the arrests were necessary
in order to prevent the likelihood of an imminent breach of the peace. It
dismissed as unrealistic the argument that lesser measures would have been
adequate to meet the degree of risk. Continuous police supervision was not a
feasible option, given the many demands on police resources. The claims that
the police acted unlawfully as a matter of domestic law therefore failed.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>The Administrative Court interpreted the phrase “effected for the
purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority” in article 5.1(c)
as limited in its application to the words immediately following it, that is,
for the purpose of bringing the person concerned before the court on reasonable
suspicion of having committed an offence, and not applying where the purpose of
the arrest was to prevent the commission of an offence. The court considered
that this was the more natural reading of the wording, and that the Strasbourg
case law on the point was inconclusive. For the purposes of the Convention a
breach of the peace counts as an offence, despite it not being classified as an
offence under English law: <i>Steel v United Kingdom </i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/95.html">28 EHRR 603</a>,

conformed with article 5.1(c).</p>

</span>The police also relied on the wording of article 5.1(b). Richards LJ
commented that that the wording seemed ill suited on its face to cover arrest
and detention for the purpose of preventing a future, albeit imminent, breach
of the peace, but that it was unnecessary for the court to decide the point and
better not to do so: para 187.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>The Court of Appeal agreed with the decision of the Administrative Court
in a judgment given by Maurice Kay LJ, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/3.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2152</a>, but not with its
reasoning. The Court of Appeal was strongly influenced by the judgment of the
Strasbourg court in <i>Ostendorf v Germany</i> (2013) 34 BHRC 738, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/197.html">[2013] ECHR 197</a>, which
post-dated the decision of the Administrative Court. The Court of Appeal held
that it was well established in the Strasbourg jurisprudence that the words
“for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority” govern
all the limbs of article 5.1(c) and that English courts should accept that
interpretation. However, it declined to follow the majority view in <i>Ostendorf
</i>that article 5.1(c) was incapable of authorising purely preventive
detention, notwithstanding the existence of good grounds to believe an offence
to be imminent, and that the person concerned must be suspected of having already
committed a criminal offence.</p>

</span>On the facts, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was “an irresistible
inference that the officers who arrested and detained the [appellants]
appreciated that, if only by reference to domestic law, the [appellants] could not
be lawfully detained beyond the point at which it was reasonably practicable to
take them before the magistrates’ court”: para 85. The court also inferred that
as things were in central London on the day of the royal wedding it would not
have been practicable to take the appellants before a magistrates’ court before
they were released, but that they would have been taken to court if the
situation had deteriorated to the extent that it was necessary to continue
their detention to a point in time when it would have been practicable to do
so. The court therefore concluded that that the appellants were arrested and
detained “for the purpose of bringing [them] before the competent legal
authority”, if that were to become necessary, so as to prolong their detention
on a lawful basis: para 86.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>As to article 5.1(b), the Court of Appeal observed that the decision of

the interpretation of article 5.1(c) by the Strasbourg court in <i>Ostendorf</i>,
and that the process of reasoning by which the Court of Appeal arrived at its
finding that the appellants were detained for the purpose of bringing them
before the court was artificial and contrived. They submit that it was plain
from the evidence as a whole that the purpose of the appellants’ arrest and
detention was purely preventive. They also submit that article 5.1(b) was not
applicable even on the approach taken by the court in <i>Ostendorf</i>.</a></p><a name="para13">

internment without trial of IRA members by the Irish government. The applicant
was detained for five months, without being brought before a judge, under
legislation which gave to ministers special powers of detention without trial,
whenever the government published a proclamation that the powers were necessary
to secure the preservation of peace and order. The government argued that such
detention was permitted by the second limb of article 5.1(c), which was not
qualified by the words “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent
legal authority” and therefore was also not within article 5.3. The court
rejected this argument, noting that in the French text there is a comma after
the passage up to “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal
authority (“en vue d’être conduit devant l’autorité judiciaire compétente”),
meaning that this passage qualifies all the categories after the comma. The
court also said (at para 14) that the government’s interpretation would permit
the arrest and detention of a person suspected of an intent to commit an
offence for an unlimited period on the strength merely of an executive
decision, and that this, with its implications of arbitrary power, would lead
to conclusions repugnant to the fundamental principles of the Convention.</p>

</span>The court held that the expression “effected for the purpose of bringing
him before the competent legal authority” qualified every category of arrest or
detention referred to in article 5.1(c), and the clause therefore permitted
deprivation of liberty “only when such deprivation is effected for the purpose
of bringing the person arrested or detained before the competent judicial
authority, irrespective of whether such person is a person who is reasonably
suspected of having committed an offence, or a person whom it is reasonably
considered necessary to restrain from committing an offence, or a person whom
it is reasonably considered necessary to restrain from absconding after having
committed an offence”. The court further held that the purpose of bringing the
person before the court might, depending on the circumstances, be either “for
the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the
purpose of deciding on the merits” (para 14).</a></p><a name="para17">

applicants were arrested and detained under prevention of terrorism legislation
on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation
of acts of terrorism. They were released without charge after periods between
four and six days and without having been brought before a magistrate. The
court held that in each case there had been a violation of article 5.3 but not
article 5.1. The court accepted that there was an intention to bring them
before a court if sufficient and usable evidence had been obtained during the
police investigation following their arrest, and that this was sufficient to satisfy
the requirement in article 5.1(c) that the detention was for the purpose of
bringing them before the court. There was no reason to believe that the police
investigation was not in good faith or that their detention was for any other
reason than to further the investigation by confirming or dispelling the
suspicions which grounded their arrest. In other words, the police were not
required to intend to take the applicants to court in the event of there being
insufficient evidence after investigation to proceed against them.</p>

of violation of his article 5 rights in successive periods of detention. The
first period of five weeks was under a broad provision of the criminal code
which permitted preventive detention in connection with banditry, criminal
association or terrorising a person. During that period no investigation was
carried out and no charge was made. In holding that preventive detention of the
kind found in that case was not permitted by article 5.1(c), the court stated
that a person may be detained under that clause only “in the context of
criminal proceedings” for the purpose of bringing him before the competent
legal authority “on suspicion of his having committed an offence” (para 50).
However, as the Court of Appeal observed in this case (para 61), that was
plainly not a complete statement of article 5.1(c).</p>

recognised that article 5.1(c) embraces different sets of circumstances. The
applicants took part in an anti-fishing protest at an angling match on 28 May
1994. Their aim was to sabotage the match by throwing twigs in the water close
to the anglers’ hooks so as to disturb the surface, while other protestors
sounded horns to frighten the fish. When they refused to stop, they were
arrested. The custody record gave the reason for their initial detention as to
“allow a period of calming, and to determine method of processing”. They were
later kept in custody in order to take them before the magistrates for the
purpose of being bound over to keep the peace. The court found that their
complaint under article 5.1 was manifestly unfounded. It said that their
initial detention was to prevent them from committing an offence and their
continued detention was for the purpose of bringing them before the court on
suspicion of having committed an “offence”. Both the initial arrest and their
subsequent detention were therefore compatible with article 5.1(c).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Most recently, <i>Ostendorf </i>raised parallel issues to those in the
present case. The applicant was known to the police as a suspected football
hooligan and gang leader. He travelled by train from Bremen to Frankfurt to
attend a match with 30 to 40 other fans, most of whom were known to the police
and considered to be hooligans prepared to use violence. The group went under
police surveillance to a pub. They were told that they would be escorted to the
football ground and that any member leaving the group would be arrested. At the
pub the applicant was seen talking to a member of a rival hooligan group. He
remained in the pub when the rest of his group left and was discovered by the
police hidden in a locked cubicle in the ladies’ bathroom. He gave no plausible
explanation why he was there. The police reasonably concluded that he was
trying to evade police surveillance and that he was planning violence. He was
arrested under public security legislation which permitted the police to take a
person into custody if necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a
criminal or regulatory offence of considerable importance to the general
public. He was taken to a police station and released one hour after the game
finished, when it was considered that the risk of violence had passed. He
complained that his arrest and detention violated his rights under article 5.
The Strasbourg court (Fifth Section) unanimously rejected his complaint.</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para22">“88.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court is aware of the
importance, in the German legal system, of preventive police custody in order
to avert dangers to the life and limb of potential victims or significant
material damage, in particular, in situations involving the policing of large
groups of people during mass events … It reiterates that article 5 cannot be
interpreted in such a way as to make it impracticable for the police to fulfil
their duties of maintaining order and protecting the public - provided that
they comply with the underlying principle of article 5, which is to protect the
individual from arbitrariness (see <i>Austin v UK</i> (2012) 32 BHRC 618, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/459.html">[2012] ECHR 459</a>  at

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court was divided on how to implement that principle. The majority
held that the applicant’s detention was permitted under article 5.1(b) but not
under article 5.1(c). Conversely, the minority were for holding that it was
permitted under article 5.1(c) but not under article 5.1(b).</a></p><a name="para23">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to article 5.1(c), the majority held (at paras 82 to 86) that the
second part (“when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his
committing an offence”) only covers pre-trial detention, and not custody for
preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having <i>already</i>
committed an offence. Moreover, it held that the purpose of bringing the person
before a court must be for the purpose of trial, and not just for the purpose
of determining the legality of his preventive detention. The majority sought to
answer the government’s argument that on this analysis the second part would
add nothing to the first, saying that it was not superfluous since it could
cover the detention of a person who had already committed preparatory acts
which were themselves punishable in order to prevent him from going on to
commit the full offence. However, that does not fully meet the point, for in
the hypothetical case postulated by the majority the applicant would already be
suspected of having committed an offence, for which he could be detained under
the first part of article 5.1(c).</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The minority (Judges Lemmens and Jaderblom) considered that the case law
to the effect that preventive detention under article 5.1(c) was permissible
“only in the context of criminal proceedings, for the purpose of bringing [a
person] before the competent legal authority on suspicion of his having
committed an offence” (<i>Jecius v Lithuania</i> at para 50), derogated without
any specific explanation from what the court stated in <i>Lawless</i>, and that
it went too far. In <i>Lawless </i>the court recognised that article 5.1(c)
covered three different types of situation. The judgment in <i>Lawless </i>stated
(para 14) that the clause had to be construed in conjunction with article 5.3,
with which it formed a whole; and that the obligation to bring a person
arrested or detained in any of the circumstances contemplated by article 5.1(c)
was “for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for
the purpose of deciding on the merits”. The minority in <i>Ostendorf</i> said
that later case law had unduly restricted the purpose of bringing the detainee
before the court to “deciding on the merits” and had done away with the
possible purpose of “examining the question of deprivation of liberty”. They
favoured returning to <i>Lawless</i>, which did more justice to prevention as a
possible justification for a deprivation of liberty than the interpretation
followed by the majority. They said at para 5 of their judgment:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An early, ‘prompt’ release,
without any appearance before a judge or judicial officer, may occur frequently
in cases of ‘administrative’ detention for preventive purposes. Even so, in
such a situation it will be enough for the purpose of guaranteeing the rights
inherent in article 5 of the convention if the lawfulness of the detention can
subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Applying that approach to the facts, the minority said that the applicant
was detained in order to prevent a brawl in connection with a football match.
They were of the opinion that the police, faced with the situation of a large
football event with the assembly of many aggressive supporters in which the
applicant appeared and, as assessed by the authorities, planned to instigate
fights, could reasonably consider it necessary to arrest and detain him. He was
detained for approximately four hours. It did not appear that this period
exceeded what was required in order to prevent the applicant from fulfilling
his intentions. For those reasons they concluded that his arrest and detention
were justifiable under article 5.1(c).</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to article 5.1(b), it is well established in the Strasbourg case law
that an “obligation prescribed by law” within the meaning of the paragraph must
be “concrete and specific” and that a general obligation to comply with the
criminal law will not suffice: see, for example, <i>Schwabe v Germany </i>(2011)
59 EHRR 28, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1986.html">[2011] ECHR 1986</a>, paras 70 and 73. The majority found that the requirement of
specificity was satisfied on the facts because the obligation whose fulfilment
was secured by the applicant’s detention was not to arrange a brawl between
Bremen and Frankfurt hooligans in the hours before, during and after the
football match in the vicinity of Frankfurt. In the case of a negative
obligation, it was necessary and sufficient to show that the applicant had
taken clear and positive steps which indicated that he would not fulfil the
obligation. For this purpose it was necessary that the person concerned was
made aware of the specific act which he or she was to refrain from committing,
and that the person showed himself or herself not willing to refrain from doing
so (as the applicant had done by ignoring a police warning). They added that in
the case of a duty not to commit a specific offence at a certain time and
place, the obligation must be considered as having been fulfilled for the
purposes of article 5.1(b) at the latest at the time when it ceased to exist by
lapse of the time at which the offence at issue was to take place.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judges Lemmens and Jaderblom disagreed, because the legislation under
which the applicant was arrested did not specify any obligation which he failed
to fulfil. Although the police specifically ordered him to stay with his group
of fans, the statutory obligation not to commit criminal or regulatory offences
was in the view of the minority too general for the purpose of article 5.1(b).
The cases on the subject all concerned obligations to perform specific acts.
Things might have been different if the applicant had been the subject of a
specific banning order, but that was not the case. His only legal obligation
was the general obligation not to commit certain crimes or regulatory offences.
That general obligation did not become specific and concrete merely because he
was reminded of it in the context of a specific football match.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental principle underlying article 5 is the need to protect
the individual from arbitrary detention, and an essential part of that
protection is timely judicial control, but at the same time article 5 must not
be interpreted in such a way as would make it impracticable for the police to
perform their duty to maintain public order and protect the lives and property
of others. These twin requirements are not contradictory but complementary, and
this is reflected in the statement in <i>Ostendorf </i>cited at para 22 above.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>In balancing these twin considerations it is necessary to keep a grasp
of reality and the practical implications. Indeed, this is central to the
principle of proportionality, which is not only embedded in article 5 but is
part of the common law relating to arrest for breach of the peace. In <i>Austin
v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/5.html">[2009] 1 AC 564</a> Lord Hope made
the point at para 34:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I would hold … that there is
room, even in the case of fundamental rights as to whose application no
restriction or limitation is permitted by the Convention, for a pragmatic
approach to be taken which takes full account of all the circumstances. No
reference is made in article 5 to the interests of public safety or the
protection of public order as one of the cases in which a person may be
deprived of his liberty … But the importance that must be attached in the
context of article 5 to measures taken in the interests of public safety is
indicated by article 2 of the Convention, as the lives of persons affected by
mob violence may be at risk if measures of crowd control cannot be adopted by
the police. This is a situation where a search for a fair balance is necessary
if these competing fundamental rights are to be reconciled with each other. The
ambit that is given to article 5 as to measures of crowd control must, of
course, take account of the rights of the individual as well as the interests
of the community. So any steps that are taken must be resorted to in good faith
and must be proportionate to the situation which has made the measures
necessary.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this case there was nothing arbitrary about the decisions to arrest,
detain and release the appellants. They were taken in good faith and were
proportionate to the situation. If the police cannot lawfully arrest and detain
a person for a relatively short time (too short for it to be practical to take
the person before a court) in circumstances where this is reasonably considered
to be necessary for the purpose of preventing imminent violence, the practical
consequence would be to hamper severely their ability to carry out the
difficult task of maintaining public order and safety at mass public events.
This would run counter to the fundamental principles previously identified.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is, however, a difficult question of law as to how such preventive
power can be accommodated within article 5. The Strasbourg case law on the
point is not clear and settled, as is evident from the division of opinions
within the Fifth Section in <i>Ostendorf.</i> Moreover, while this court must
take into account the Strasbourg case law, in the final analysis it has a
judicial choice to make.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The view of the minority in <i>Ostendorf, </i>that article 5.1(c) is
capable of applying in a case of detention for preventive purposes followed by
early release (that is, before the person could practicably be brought before a
court), is in my opinion correct for a number of reasons.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the first place I agree with the Administrative Court that the
situation fits more naturally within the language of article 5.1(c) than
5.1(b). On its plain wording article 5.1(c) covers three types of case, the
second being when the arrest or detention of a person “is reasonably considered
necessary to prevent his committing an offence.”</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is force in the argument that the interpretation adopted by the
majority in <i>Ostendorf </i>collapses the second into the first (“reasonable
suspicion of having committed an offence”) and is inconsistent with <i>Lawless.</i></a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is accepted by the police that English courts should treat <i>Lawless
</i>as authoritative, but in that case the court was not concerned with a
situation in which the police had every reason to anticipate that the risk
necessitating the person’s arrest would pass in a relatively short time and
there was every likelihood of it ending before the person could as a matter of
practicality be brought before a court. It would be perverse if it were the law
that in such circumstances, in order to be lawfully able to detain the person
so as to prevent their imminently committing an offence, the police must
harbour a purpose of continuing the detention, after the risk had passed, until
such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being
bound over to keep the peace in future. This would lengthen the period of
detention and place an unnecessary burden on court time and police resources.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some analogy may be drawn with <i>Brogan</i>, in which the court
rejected the argument that at the time of the arrest the police must intend to
take the arrested person before the court willy nilly, regardless of whether on
investigation there was cause to do so.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to make coherent sense and achieve the fundamental purpose of
article 5, I would read the qualification on the power of arrest or detention
under article 5.1(c), contained in the words “for the purpose of bringing him
before the competent legal authority”, as implicitly dependent on the cause for
detention continuing long enough for the person to be brought before the court.
I agree therefore with Judges Lemmens and Jederblom in para 5 of their judgment
in <i>Ostendorf </i>(cited at para 25 above) that in the case of an early
release from detention for preventive purposes, it is enough for guaranteeing
the rights inherent in article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can
subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I prefer to put the matter that way, rather than as the Court of Appeal
did by inferring the existence of a conditional purpose ab initio to take the
appellants before the court, although it makes no difference to the result. I
have no disagreement with the Court of Appeal that the appellants would have
been brought before a court to determine the legality of their continued
detention, if it had been considered necessary to detain them long enough for
this to happen. The case would then have been materially similar to <i>Nicol
and Selvanayagam</i>, where the applicants’ initial detention was preventive
and they were later kept in custody and brought before the court to be bound
over. It would be contrary to the spirit and underlying objective of article 5
if the appellants’ early release placed them in a stronger position to complain
of a breach of article 5 than if it had been decided to detain them for longer
in order to take them before magistrates to be bound over.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to article 5.1(b), I am inclined to the same view as the minority in <i>Ostendorf
</i>that the obligation has to be much more specific than a general obligation
not to commit a criminal offence (or, in this case, a breach of the peace), and
that such a general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of
specificity by focusing narrowly on the particular facts or by the person
concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. There are
also practical considerations. The police may find it necessary to take action
to prevent an imminent breach of the peace in circumstances where there is not
sufficient time to give a warning. An example might be a football match where
two unruly groups collide and the police see no alternative but to detain them,
or the ringleaders on both sides, immediately for what may be quite a short
time. In summary, I would be concerned that in stretching article 5.1(b) beyond
its previously recognised ambit the majority found it necessary to impose
limitations which in another case might leave the police effectively powerless
to step in for the protection of the public.</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would uphold the decision of the lower courts that the appellants’
arrests and detention were lawful under article 5.1(c) and dismiss the appeals.</a></p><a name="para41">
