</span>The factual background to this appeal is set out in the judgments of
this Court in <i>Belhaj v Straw</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/3.html">[2017] AC 964</a>. In short summary, the first
Appellant, Mr Belhaj, was a political opponent of the government of Colonel
Gadaffi in Libya. He and his wife Ms Boudchar (the second Appellant) contend
that they were abducted and maltreated by agents of Malaysia, Thailand and the
United States, and eventually “rendered” to the Libyan authorities, by whom
they were imprisoned, tortured, and subjected to other serious maltreatment. The
Appellants allege that this was done with the connivance of the British Secret
Intelligence Service and in particular that of Sir Mark Allen, who is said to
have been a senior officer of that service. We make no finding about that, any
more than the courts below did. Her Majesty’s Government has neither confirmed
nor denied that Sir Mark was involved in these events, and references to him in
this judgment should be read in that light. In parallel proceedings, the
Appellants have sued the British Government for damages. The present appeal
arises out of an investigation commenced by the Metropolitan Police in 2012
into possible criminal offences committed in the course of this history.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 9 June 2016, the Director of Public Prosecutions announced her
decision not to bring any prosecutions. That decision was based on a decision
of Ms Hemming, a senior prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service and on
detailed advice given to Ms Hemming by First Senior Treasury Counsel that there
was insufficient evidence to prosecute for any offence subject to the criminal
jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In communicating her decision to the
Appellants’ representatives, Ms Hemming pointed out that “the security marking
of the potential evidence in this case is such that I am unable to provide you
with a summary of the material submitted to us.” The Appellants applied for an
internal review of the decision under the Victims’ Right of Review procedure.
The case was accordingly referred to another senior CPS prosecutor, Mr Gregor McGill,
who reached the same conclusion for substantially the same reasons.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 20 October 2016, the Appellants issued the present proceedings,
seeking judicial review of the failure to prosecute Sir Mark Allen. The
application is made on three grounds: misdirection in law, procedural
unfairness and inconsistency with the evidence. Only the last of these grounds
is relevant to the present issues. The Appellants contend that it is irrational
because, they say, the material in the public domain is alone enough to make
good the elements of the relevant offences. The Director takes issue with this.
She says that the Appellants’ contention is based on the very limited documentation
available to them, whereas the decision not to prosecute was supported by an
examination of some 28,000 pages of statements, exhibits and other documents
which were considered by the CPS and Treasury Counsel but could not be
disclosed to Appellants because of its classification (“TOP SECRET - STRAP 2”).
The Appellants’ response is that neither the decision itself nor the Director’s
evidence in support of it adequately discloses her reasoning on this question.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>The issue on this appeal is whether on the hearing of the application
for judicial review, it would be open to the Court to receive closed material
disclosed only to the court and a special advocate but not to the Appellants.
As will appear, this depends on whether the judicial review proceedings are
“proceedings in a criminal cause or matter”.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Closed material procedure is a derogation from ordinary principles of
forensic justice because it necessarily limits the ability of a litigant or a
defendant in criminal proceedings to deploy his case. The degree of limitation
will depend on the arrangements made to represent his interests in some other
way, although no one suggests that these arrangements can entirely make good
the adverse effect on him. There are nonetheless cases in which, notwithstanding
that closed material procedure represents imperfect justice, the alternative is
no justice at all. For that reason, the European Court of Human Rights has held
that closed material procedure may be justified in some cases. In <i>A v United
Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/301.html">(2009) 49 EHRR 29</a>, para 205. the Court observed that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… even in proceedings under
article 6 for the determination of guilt on criminal charges, there may be
restrictions on the right to a fully adversarial procedure where strictly
necessary in the light of a strong countervailing public interest, such as
national security, the need to keep secret certain police methods of
investigation or the protection of the fundamental rights of another person.
There will not be a fair trial, however, unless any difficulties caused to the
defendant by a limitation on his rights are sufficiently counterbalanced by the
procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, for example, <i>Doorson v
Netherlands</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/14.html">(1996) 22 EHRR 330</a>, para 70; <i>Van Mechelen v Netherlands</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1997/22.html">(1998) 25 EHRR 647</a>; para 58, Reports 1997-III; <i>Jasper v United Kingdom</i> [GC] <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/90.html">(2000) 30 EHRR 441</a>, paras 51-53; <i>SN v Sweden</i>, No 34209/96, para 47, ECHR
2002-V; and <i>Botmeh and Alami v United Kingdom</i> (2008) 46 EHRR 31, para 37.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Strasbourg court in that case held that the use of
closed material procedure before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission
could be consistent with the Convention, provided that it was strictly
necessary in the interests of national security. It considered that the
interests of the complainant were sufficiently protected by the use of a
special advocate, in those cases where the defendant was given enough
information about the allegations against him to enable him to give meaningful
instructions to the special advocate. More recent Strasbourg jurisprudence has
softened the latter requirement in a case where, even in the absence of such
disclosure, resort to closed material procedure was proportionate and the
proceedings as a whole were fair: <i>Kennedy v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/682.html">(2011) 52 EHRR 4</a>, paras 184-187, as applied in <i>Tariq v Home Office</i> <i>(JUSTICE
intervening)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/35.html">[2012] 1 AC 452</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the mere fact that the use of closed material procedure may
represent a fair balance between national security and the demands of
procedural justice does not mean that the courts have power to adopt it. The
rule at common law is that, with very limited exceptions, <span lang="EN">no
material can be put before the court in litigation, civil or criminal, without
being disclosed to the parties. The rule was reaffirmed for criminal cases in <i>R
v Davis</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/36.html">[2008] 1 AC 1128</a> in the special context of the anonymisation<span lang="EN"> of witness evidence. In civil proceedings it was reaffirmed in <i>Al
Rawi v Security Service</i> </span><i>(JUSTICE intervening)</i> <span lang="EN"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/34.html">[2012] 1 AC 531</a>, which concerned the use of closed material procedure in the context
of allegations somewhat similar to those made by the Appellants in the present
case. These decisions are authority for the proposition that the adoption of
closed material procedure is not within the inherent jurisdiction of the courts
and requires specific statutory authority. Closed material procedure has been
authorised by statute for proceedings before certain specialised tribunals. It
was authorised in proceedings before the SIAC by sections 5 and 6 of the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, and provision was made for its
use by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal under section 69(4) of the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. However, until the enactment of the Justice
and Security Act 2013, the High Court had no general statutory power to receive
closed material.</span></p>

</span>The background to the Act of 2013 is explained in the Justice and
Security Green Paper Cm 8194/2011. There had been a growing number of cases in
which civil claims for damages had been brought against the Government or the
security agencies or their personnel, which were untriable except at
unacceptable cost to the national interest, because of the disclosure of secret
material that would have been required. The Government had been obliged to buy
off these claims in order to avoid that damage. This was seen as
unsatisfactory, because it was costly and deprived the public of answers which
litigation might have provided. A more general authorisation of closed material
procedure was conceived to be a way of enabling substantial justice to be done
on the basis of a full examination of any relevant secret material, even if it
was not in all respects seen to be done.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>Part 2 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 authorised the use of closed
material procedure in civil proceedings on certain conditions. The first step
in the statutory procedure is an application to a court seized of “relevant
civil proceedings” for a “declaration that the proceedings are proceedings in
which a closed material application may be made to the court”: section 6(1),
(2) of the Act. Section 6(3)-(5) provide:</a></p><a name="para8">

necessary precondition for an application under CPR Part 82, made under powers
conferred by section 8 of the Act. Part 82.6 provides for the court to sit in
private and in the absence of any party and his legal representatives, inter
alia for the purpose of securing that information is “not disclosed where
disclosure would be damaging to the interests of national security.” The Act
and rules made under it contain a number of safeguards. First, section 7 requires
the court to keep a section 6 declaration under review and to revoke it if it
considers that the declaration is no longer in the interests of the fair and
effective administration of justice in the proceedings. A formal review must in
any event be conducted once pre-trial disclosure has been completed: section 7.
Secondly, the law officers may appoint a special advocate under section 9, and
generally will. Thirdly, section 14(2)(c) provides that nothing in sections 6
to 13 “is to be read as requiring a court or tribunal to act in a manner
inconsistent with article 6 of the Human Rights Convention”. Fourthly, the
Secretary of State is required by section 13 to appoint a reviewer to review
and report on the operation of these provisions.</span></a></p><a name="para9">

application for the declaration, he said, </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2017/1861.html">[2017] EWHC 1861 (QB)</a>, para

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Whilst this is a matter for more
detailed consideration at the section 8 stage, it appears to me to be very
unlikely that the material could be put into open or made available to the claimants
or their legal representatives in a way which would better promote a fair and
effective trial than a closed material procedure. As I have observed, much of
the material can only properly be understood and weighed in the context of a
substantial part of the material as a whole, such that gisting is unlikely to
provide a realistic solution in most instances. Sittings in private and/or the
use of confidentiality rings are unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution,
both because of the risk of disclosure, even inadvertent, and because of the
hobbling effect on the conduct of the claimants’ case if, as is almost
inevitable, they were themselves to be excluded from the confidentiality ring …
These claims are brought not only against the Government, but against two named
individuals who both wish to have a real and fair opportunity to defend
themselves, but who cannot do so unless there is a closed material procedure.”</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para11"><span lang="EN">In the judicial review proceedings, the Appellants’
application for permission to apply for review came before Jeremy Baker J on
paper. He ordered that it should be adjourned to a rolled up hearing at which
both permission and the substantive claim would be considered. The Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs then applied for a section 6
declaration. His application concerned a narrower range of material than that
covered by Popplewell J’s declaration in the civil action. It related in
practice to three documents: the full decision letters of Ms Hemming and Mr
McGill and the advice of Treasury Counsel. It is clear from the letters in
which the CPS decisions were communicated to the Appellants that the analysis
of the evidence in those three documents was substantially based on secret
material. However, the Secretary of State’s application was met with a challenge
to the court’s jurisdiction on the ground that the judicial review proceedings
were “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter.”</span></a></p><a name="para11">

dealt with that challenge as a preliminary issue </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/3056.html">[2017] EWHC 3056 (Admin)</a>. They
held that the present proceedings were not “proceedings in a criminal cause or
matter”. Their reasons can fairly be summarised in two propositions. First,
proceedings by way of judicial review of a prosecutorial decision do not decide
criminal liability. They are a means of holding the executive, in the form of
the prosecuting authorities, to account. Such proceedings should properly be
categorised as civil, even if their subject matter is a potential criminal
prosecution. Secondly, the alternative to closed material procedure was likely
to be a successful application by the Secretary of State for public interest
immunity, with the result that the sensitive material would be entirely removed
from the scrutiny of the court, instead of being available on the basis of
limited disclosure. That was an outcome which would probably be unjust to one
or other party. The Divisional Court certified the following point of public
importance suitable for consideration by this court:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Does a case where claimants seek
judicial review of a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to
prosecute an individual constitute ‘proceedings in a criminal cause or matter’,
within the meaning and for the purposes of section 6(1) and 6(11) of the
Justice and Security Act 2013? As a consequence, is there jurisdiction in such
a case to entertain an application for a declaration under section 6 of that
Act, that a closed material application may be made to the court?”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN"><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></a></span><a name="para13"><span lang="EN">Mr Jaffey QC, who appeared for the Appellants, took
it as his starting point that closed material procedure represents a
curtailment of fundamental common law rights. Therefore, it was said, in
accordance with the principle of legality, any statutory provision relied upon
as authorising it should be given the narrowest possible construction: <i>R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html">[2000] 2 AC 115</a>, 131
(Lord Hoffmann). The principle is that general or ambiguous words cannot
normally be taken to authorise a curtailment of fundamental rights because
“there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified
meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.” Parliament must
“squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN"><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></a></span><a name="para14"><span lang="EN">Valuable as that principle is, I do not think that
it helps to resolve the question at issue on this appeal. The Justice and
Security Act 2013 made significant and acknowledged inroads into the common law
principle as applied to “relevant civil proceedings”. It did this, subject to
specific safeguards, on the ground that the interests of justice might well
require the withholding of evidence from a party if the dispute cannot
otherwise be tried fairly and consistently with the demands of national
security. As the House of Lords held in <i>Al-Rawi</i>, the existence and
extent of the court’s jurisdiction to adopt closed material procedure is a
matter for Parliament. That involves a balance between the potentially
conflicting interests of national security and justice, which Parliament has
drawn in the Act of 2013 by authorising the procedure subject to the statutory
safeguards. This leaves little scope for any presumption that Parliament does
not intend to curtail fundamental common law rights. Parliament plainly did
intend to curtail them in what it conceived to be a wider public interest. The
only questions are on what conditions and in what proceedings. Those questions
must be answered on ordinary principles of construction, without presumptions
in either direction. In <i>R (Sarkandi) v Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs</i> [2016] 3 All ER 837, para 58, Richards LJ, delivering
the only reasoned judgment in the Court of Appeal, put the point in terms on
which I cannot improve:</span></a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The 2013 Act is one of those in
which Parliament has stipulated that a closed material procedure may be
permitted by the court. It represents Parliament’s assessment of how, in
relevant civil proceedings, the balance is to be struck between the competing
interests of open justice and natural justice on the one hand and the
protection of national security on the other, coupled with express provision in
section 14(2)(c) to secure compliance with article 6. It is certainly an
exceptional procedure, and in the nature of things one would expect it to be
used only rarely, but the conditions for its use are defined in detail in the
statute. In the circumstances there is, in my judgment, no reason to give the
statutory provisions a narrow or restrictive construction, save for any reading
down that may be required, in accordance with the terms of the statute itself,
for compliance with article 6. Subject to that point, the provisions should be
given their natural meaning and applied accordingly.”</p>

</span>The first point to be made is perhaps the most obvious one, namely that
although the High Court has only very limited original criminal jurisdiction,
it has an extensive criminal jurisdiction by way of review. It is a feature of
English criminal procedure that many decisions made in the course of criminal
proceedings or in relation to prospective criminal proceedings are subject to
judicial review in the High Court, mainly but not only in cases where there is
no statutory avenue of appeal. The High Court’s review jurisdiction extends in
principle to the exercise of any official’s functions in relation to the
criminal process. These include police decisions to investigate or charge (<i>R
v Comr of Police of the Metropolis, Ex p Blackburn </i>[1968] 2 QB 118) or to
administer cautions (<i>R (Aru) v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/199.html">[2004] 1 WLR 1697</a>); decisions of prosecutors whether or not to prosecute (<i>R (Corner
House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office (JUSTICE Intervening)</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/60.html">[2009] 1 AC 756</a>, para 30), or of the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to
consent to a prosecution (<i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/43.html">[2000] 2 AC 326</a>); and decisions of the Attorney General whether to take over a
prosecution or enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> (<i>Mohit v Director of Public
Prosecutions of Mauritius</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2006/20.html">[2006] 1 WLR 3343</a>). It also exercises an
analogous jurisdiction by way of writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> over the
detention of suspects. The High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the
criminal process is not limited to the decisions of officials. It extends to
the decisions of magistrates’ courts and to those of the Crown Court other than
in relation to trial on indictment. For this purpose the Crown Court, although
a superior court of record, is treated as if it were an inferior tribunal: see
sections 28(2) and 29(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The categories of case
giving rise to judicial review of the Crown Court include a variety of orders
held not to have been made in relation to trial on indictment, such as orders
in proceedings against a person found unfit to plead, orders binding over an
acquitted defendant; or orders made in the exercise of the Crown Court’s
appellate jurisdiction. The main categories are reviewed by Lord
Browne-Wilkinson in <i>R v Manchester Crown Court, Ex p Director of Public
Prosecutions</i> [1993] 1 WLR 1524, 1530. The High Court’s powers of review
have also been held to extend to any excess of jurisdiction by the Crown Court,
even in relation to a trial on indictment: <i>R v Maidstone Crown Court, Ex p
Harrow London Borough Council</i> [2000] QB 719. It follows that judicial
review as such cannot be regarded as an inherently civil proceeding. It may or
may not be, depending on the subject-matter. What is clear is that it is an
integral part of the criminal justice system, whose availability is in many
cases essential to the fairness of the process and its compliance with article
6 of the Human Rights Convention. It is against this background that one must
construe the phrase “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” as it appears
in section 6(11) of the Justice and Security Act 2013.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The phrase itself is of some antiquity. It has been used since the
Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 to define a category of appeals which were
excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Under section 47 of that
Act, there was no relevant right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from a
decision of the High Court “in a criminal cause or matter”. The corresponding
provision today is section 18(1)(a) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. Section 151
of the 1981 Act, which substantially reproduces the relevant definitions in
section 100 of the Act of 1873 and section 225 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925, provides that “cause” means “any action or
any criminal proceedings”, and “matter” means “any proceedings in court not in
a cause”. Thus defined, these words have been held to refer to the proceedings
which supply the subject matter of the relevant decision: <i>Ex p Alice
Woodhall</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1888/89.html">(1888) 20 QBD 832</a>. The phrase, in the words of Lord Esher MR, at p
836 of the report of that case</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“applies to a decision by way of
judicial determination of any question raised in or with regard to proceedings,
the subject-matter of which is criminal, at whatever stage of the proceedings
the question arises.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This decision was approved by the House of Lords in <i>Provincial
Cinematograph Theatres Ltd v Newcastle upon Tyne Profiteering Committee</i>
(1921) 90 LJ (KB) 1064, in particular at pp 1067-1068 (Lord Birkenhead LC).
Accordingly, in the former case the phrase embraced a decision concerning acts
preliminary to criminal proceedings, including <i>habeas corpus</i>
applications in extradition proceedings; and in the latter decisions concerning
the resolution of a local authority to prosecute for profiteering under wartime
regulations. These authorities, and others to the same effect have been
carefully analysed by the Divisional Court and the exercise need not be
repeated here. Their effect is sufficiently stated in the speech of Lord Wright
in <i>Amand v Secretary of State for Home Affairs</i> [1943] AC 147. The case
concerned a Dutch serviceman who had been arrested for desertion and brought
before a magistrate who ordered him to be handed over to the Dutch military
authorities under the Allied Forces Act 1940. An application for <i>habeas
corpus</i> was rejected by a Divisional Court. The Court of Appeal held that
they had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the Divisional Court. Lord
Wright said, at pp 159-160:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The words ‘cause or matter’ are,
in my opinion, apt to include any form of proceeding. The word ‘matter’ does
not refer to the subject-matter of the proceeding [before the Divisional
Court], but to the proceeding itself. It is introduced to exclude any limited
definition of the word ‘cause’. In the present case, the immediate proceeding
in which the order was made was not the cause or matter to which the section
refers. The cause or matter in question was the application to the court to
exercise its powers under the Allied Forces Act and the order, and to deliver
the appellant to the Dutch military authorities. It is in reference to the
nature of that proceeding that it must be determined whether there was an order
made in a criminal cause or matter.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In other words, the “matter” before the Divisional Court
was the order made by the magistrate to hand the Appellant over to the Dutch
military authorities. Lord Wright went on, at p 162, to say:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principle which I deduce from
the authorities I have cited and the other relevant authorities which I have
considered, is that if the cause or matter is one which, if carried to its
conclusion, might result in the conviction of the person charged and in a
sentence of some punishment, such as imprisonment or fine, it is a ‘criminal
cause or matter’. The person charged is thus put in jeopardy. Every order made
in such a cause or matter by an English court, is an order in a criminal cause
or matter, even though the order, taken by itself, is neutral in character and might
equally have been made in a cause or matter which is not criminal.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In other words, Lord Wright was treating the proceedings
in the Divisional Court as an integral part of the “matter” before the
magistrate. Since the latter was criminal in nature, so too was the former.
Clearly, the principle thus stated has its limits. A decision on an application
collateral to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction, such as an application for
the release of documents referred to in court, will not necessarily itself be a
decision in a “criminal cause or matter”. On that ground, the Court of Appeal
held in <i>R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates’
Court</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1188.html">[2011] 1 WLR 3253</a> that an application for judicial review of a
court’s refusal to provide the press with copies of documents referred to at a
hearing of a criminal cause or matter was not a criminal cause or matter.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Director and the Secretary of State accept, as they must, that these
decisions are unimpeachable authority for the proposition that the application
for judicial review is a proceeding in a criminal cause or matter <i>for the
purpose of any right of appeal</i>. Indeed, that is the basis on which the
present question comes before us on appeal from the Divisional Court, instead
of going to the Court of Appeal. The question is whether the decisions on
rights of appeal are germane to the definition of “relevant civil proceedings”
in the Justice and Security Act 2013.</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It has long been a well
established principle to be applied in the consideration of Acts of Parliament
that where a word of doubtful meaning has received a clear judicial
interpretation, the subsequent statute which incorporates the same word or the
same phrase in a similar context, must be construed so that the word or phrase
is interpreted according to the meaning that has previously been assigned to
it.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">per Viscount Buckmaster at p 411; cf Lord Russell of
Killowen at pp 441-442, Lord Macmillan at p 446. The effect of this principle
is to treat certain hallowed formulae as terms of art, to be applied like
statutory definitions, on the footing that Parliament must have intended to
adopt them. The reason for Lord Buckmaster’s reference to a “similar context”
is connected with his reference to words “of doubtful meaning”. The assumption
is that the words are not self-explanatory and have derived the meaning given
to them on the earlier occasion from their statutory context. Hence the probability
that Parliament intended, when it later used the same doubtful expression in
the same statutory context, that the meaning would be supplied from the
existing judicial dictionary. In <i>R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of
Westminster Magistrates’ Court (No 2)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/420.html">[2013] QB 618</a>, doubts were expressed
in the Court of Appeal about the force and value of the principle. But it is
well established, and was recently endorsed by this court in <i>R (N) v
Lewisham London Borough Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/62.html">[2015] AC 1259</a>, para 53 (Lord Clarke). It
remains good law, provided that one bears in mind that it is no more than a
presumption, even in cases where the statutory context is similar in both
enactments. The <i>Barras</i> principle is therefore of little assistance in
construing the phrase “criminal cause or matter” in the very different context
of the Justice and Security Act 2013.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I nevertheless reach the same conclusion about the meaning of
“proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” in the Justice and Security Act as
Lord Esher and Lord Wright (among others) did when construing the statutory
restrictions on the right of appeal. I do so because I think that their
reasoning reflected the natural meaning of the words. Their reasoning was not
primarily based on any special feature of the Judicature Acts. In <i>Ex p Alice
Woodhall</i>, Lord Esher referred to the undesirable results of large numbers
of appeals to the Court of Appeal in cases involving the prerogative writs
which had arisen out of acts of inferior tribunals which were criminal rather
than civil in nature. But the real basis of the decisions on appeals was that
the phrase “criminal cause or matter”, read as a whole, spoke for itself. A
“cause” is a proceeding, civil or criminal, actual or prospective, before a
court. A “matter” is something wider, namely a particular legal subject-matter,
although arising in a different proceeding. That is why a “criminal cause or
matter” in the Judicature Acts extends to a judicial review in the High Court
of a decision made in relation to actual or prospective criminal proceedings:
see <i>R (Aru) v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police</i>, <i>supra</i>. And it
is why, as Mr Eadie QC, who appeared for the Secretary of State, felt bound
accept, that even for the purpose of section 6 of the Act of 2013 a judicial
review of an extradition order would be a proceeding in a criminal cause or
matter. On that footing it seems to me to be impossible to contend that this
judicial review was anything else. The reality of the Appellants’ application
is that it is an attempt to require the Director of Public Prosecutions to
prosecute Sir Mark Allen. That is just as much a criminal matter as the
original decision of the Director not to prosecute him. I find it difficult to
conceive that Parliament could have intended to distinguish between different
procedures having the same criminal subject-matter and being part of the same
criminal process. This would have been a strange thing to do. But if the
draftsman had intended it, he could have achieved it easily enough, for example
by omitting the reference to a “matter”.</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>The Divisional Court in the present case appear to have accepted this as
a matter of language. But they considered that the statutory context of the
phrase in the Act of 2013 and the purpose of that Act pointed to a different
conclusion. I do not doubt the importance of context in construing statutes,
but I think that they adopted the wrong approach to this question. Having
decided that closed material procedure served the interests of justice better
than any alternative procedure likely to be available in a case involving
sensitive material, they concluded that the purpose of the Act required the
narrowest possible meaning to be given to the exception for criminal causes or
matters. I think that the real question is not what is the purpose of
authorising closed material procedure, the answer to which is clear enough. The
real question is what is the purpose of distinguishing in this context between
proceedings in criminal causes or matters and other proceedings.</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The explanation of the distinction given in the Green Paper appears in a
section at p 7 headed “Criminal vs Civil: Why criminal proceedings are out of
the scope of this Paper”. This is relevant not as guide to the meaning of the
words of a Bill which had not yet been published, but as evidence of the
mischief behind the distinction between civil and criminal causes or matters.
The difference between them lay in the degree of control exercisable by the
executive in criminal cases. The Green Paper pointed out that the right to a
fair trial under article 6 of the Human Rights Convention imports more onerous
requirements in criminal cases, and “the rules concerning the use and
protection of sensitive evidence are different to those in civil cases.” These
words are a reference, as the text goes on to explain, to the rule that
although the prosecution may choose to rely only on material whose disclosure
would be consistent with the national interest, it must disclose any
potentially exculpatory unused material. The prosecution may seek to limit the
disclosure of unused material by the issue of a public interest immunity
certificate, followed by an application for permission not to disclose it. But
if that application fails, the state can as a last resort avoid disclosure by
withdrawing the prosecution and allowing the defendant to be discharged. By
comparison, in civil claims, where the government is a defendant, there is no
possibility of withdrawal, so that the ability to protect sensitive material is
entirely dependent on PII claims. There is no reason to doubt that this was
indeed the rationale for the distinction between civil and criminal proceedings
in section 6 of the Act. But it is not a rationale which requires closed
material procedure to be available in an ancillary judicial review of a
decision made as an integral part of the criminal justice process, when it
would not be available for an actual trial. The executive can dispose of
proceedings of either kind by withdrawing the prosecution.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that this assumes that the prosecution is duly launched. It
does not take account, at any rate in terms, of the peculiar combination of
factors which happens to be present in this case: ie (i) a decision by an
independent prosecuting authority declining to prosecute; (ii) on the ground
that there is insufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution; (iii) for reasons
which cannot be disclosed without compromising secret material; (iv) followed
by a third party challenge to the adequacy of those reasons by way of judicial
review. However, I do not think that the rival interpretations of the Act
advanced on this appeal can sensibly be tested by reference to this scenario.
There is an obvious artificiality about claims made on that basis which makes
it difficult to treat them as any part of the mischief against which the Act
was directed. It is one thing for a court to say that a decision not to
prosecute is based on a misdirection of law. It is not disputed that the legal
basis of the two decisions of the Crown Prosecution Service is apparent from
the letters in which the decision was communicated to the Appellants. It is
quite another for a court to review the evidential material available to the
prosecution with a view to requiring it to put forward as its own evidence
secret material which it considers it to be contrary to the national interest
to deploy. In the absence of its deployment by the prosecution, secret material
could be relevant only on the footing that it was unused material potentially
exculpatory of the defendant, something which was clearly the main concern of
the promoters of the Bill but would be entirely inconsistent with the
Appellants’ case on the proposed judicial review. On the assumption, which may
or may not be justified, that this logical difficulty can be surmounted, the
state’s obvious response, as Mr Eadie acknowledged, is a contents claim to
public interest immunity. A claim to public interest immunity may well fail if
the court considers that the balance of the public interest required its
disclosure in the interest of the defence. But Parliament seems unlikely to
have had in mind the rather fanciful risk that the Court would reject a PII
claim on the ground that disclosure was necessary in the interests of the
prosecution, least of all in a case where the prosecutor considered a
prosecution to be unjustified anyway.</a></p><a name="para23">

</span>I therefore see no reason to regard the statutory context or purpose as
calling for any narrower view of “criminal cause or matter” than the words
themselves suggest. I would accordingly allow the appeal, and declare that the
present proceedings are proceedings in a criminal cause or matter for the
purpose of section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>This is a finely balanced case, as is evident from the judgments written

</span>I do so essentially for the same reasons as Lord Sumption. A challenge
by judicial review to a decision to prosecute would seem to me to fall
naturally within the concept of “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter”;
and so too a challenge to a decision not to prosecute, the whole point of which
would be to lead to a prosecution. Mr James Eadie QC for the Crown accepted,
rightly, that an extradition hearing, to decide whether or not to surrender a
person wanted for trial abroad, would be a proceeding “in a criminal cause or matter”.
Like Lord Sumption, I find it difficult to see how a distinction could sensibly
exist between such a case and the present.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span>In considering the correct construction of the concept of “proceedings

</span>The primary purpose of introducing a closed material procedure in civil
proceedings was to avoid situations in which there was relevant material which
could not on public interest grounds be disclosed, with the result that one
party (commonly the Crown) would be effectively unable to advance its case or
the court might simply conclude that the whole case had become un-triable (<i>Carnduff
v Rock </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/680.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 680</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/680.html">[2001] 1 WLR 1786</a>).</p>

</span>The position in relation to criminal proceedings is different, for
reasons explained in the Green Paper. While the Green Paper referred simply to
“criminal proceedings” as outside the scope of any proposed legislation, the
exclusion as introduced was expanded to extend to “proceedings in a criminal
cause or matter”. The expansion must have been deliberate. But there is no
reason to think that the rationale changed when the language of the exclusion was
expanded.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>The rationale as explained in the Green Paper was, in substance, that
“criminal proceedings” were outside the scope of the proposal because evidence
relied on for conviction was never kept secret from an accused in criminal
proceedings: “The evidence that the prosecutor uses in court to secure a
conviction is never withheld from the accused”. Further: “The prosecutor is
required to disclose to the accused all relevant material obtained in an
investigation (whether or not it is admissible as evidence) that might
reasonably be considered capable of undermining the prosecution case or of
assisting the case for the accused …”. Later, the Green Paper explained that
criminal proceedings involve an accusation by the state, generally in respect
of “wrongs which affect the public as a whole, so that the public has an
interest in their detection and punishment”.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>In criminal proceedings, the position in relation to sensitive public
interest material is addressed by the Public Interest Immunity (“PII”) procedure,
whereby a judge is shown the material in the absence of the accused. The
procedure ensures that the Crown must either disclose potentially exonerating

</span>Judicial review proceedings challenging decisions whether or not to
prosecute are not common. In the case of decisions to prosecute, a more
appropriate forum for any challenge is usually the criminal process itself, in
which the court has power to halt proceedings if they constitute an abuse.
Nevertheless, challenges by potential defendants by way of judicial review to
decisions to prosecute are probably more familiar than challenges by victims,
interest groups or others by way of judicial review to decisions not to
prosecute. In the present case, the challenge is to the Crown’s decision not to
prosecute, and the Crown seeks, while the applicants oppose, a closed material
procedure in relation to a challenge to a decision not to prosecute. It is
relevant to consider the applicability in this context of the rationale for
introducing a closed material procedure in civil proceedings, while excluding
proceedings in a criminal cause or matter.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>The rationale for the exclusion from the closed material procedure of
“proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” is readily applicable or
transposable to the context of a challenge by judicial review to a decision to
prosecute. If there is material which could potentially exonerate a defendant,
it should either be disclosed in the judicial review proceedings or, if the
Crown is unwilling to disclose for public security reasons, the Crown should
withdraw the charge. If there is material which could potentially incriminate
the defendant but cannot, for public security reasons, be disclosed at trial,
there would be no point in a closed material hearing to enable it to be
deployed during the judicial review proceedings, when it could not subsequently
be used at trial. There is no basis on which to detect or impute any
Parliamentary intention to provide for a closed material procedure in this
context.</a></p><a name="para33">

</span>What then about the present context, the less familiar situation of a
challenge by alleged victims by judicial review to a decision not to prosecute?
The rationale stated in the Green Paper for the exclusion of any closed
material procedure in “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” was to
protect the rights of the accused, not to facilitate the pursuit of criminal
proceedings against them. If it had been the applicant who was seeking a closed
material procedure with a view to identifying further incriminating material,
there would seem no real point in such a procedure during judicial review
proceedings, if this material could not for PII reasons be disclosed and used
at trial. Nor can Parliament sensibly be taken to have had in mind the remote
possibility that a closed material procedure might identify incriminating
material, which was not the subject of PII immunity and on which the Crown had
either not thought to rely, or the significance of which the Crown had failed
sufficiently to appreciate.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>Here, however, it is the Crown which seeks a closed material procedure
in relation to a third party challenge by alleged victims to a decision not to
pursue charges. It does so on the basis that such a procedure it would enable
the court to evaluate the decision in the light of all the available evidential
material. The suggestion is presumably that there is or may be sensitive
material, which cannot for public interest reasons be disclosed but which
points away from the pursuit of any criminal charge. In criminal proceedings,
the Crown can address this problem by simply refraining from pursuit of any
charge, which will render irrelevant any complaint by any potential defendant
about non-disclosure of the material. It is less obvious how the Crown, having
decided not to prosecute, can address a third party complaint that the material
available does not appear on its face to justify its decision not to pursue a
charge against a potential accused.</a></p><a name="para35">

</span>One possibility, not explored in submissions, is that, since there is
sensitive material on the basis of which the Crown had taken its decision not
to prosecute but which cannot, on public interest grounds, be disclosed, the
Crown would be entitled to the benefit of the presumption or regularity of its
decision: see <i>R (Haralambous) v Crown Court at St Albans (Secretary of State

</span>Be that as it may, I do not consider that the relatively unusual
situation which exists in the present case can serve as a reliable guide to
Parliament’s presumed intention when introducing the exception of “proceedings

judicial review are “in a criminal cause or matter” according to the natural
sense of that phrase; and no real support is obtained for a narrower
interpretation from a consideration of the rationale behind the introduction of
a closed material procedure in civil proceedings and behind its exclusion in

</span>On behalf of the Appellants, Mr Jaffey QC submits that closed material
procedures are a serious curtailment of the fundamental rights to open and
natural justice. He places at the forefront of his submissions the following
observations by Lord Dyson in <i>Al-Rawi v Security Service</i> <i>(JUSTICE
intervening)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/34.html">[2012] 1 AC 531</a>, paras 47-48:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my view, it is not for the
courts to extend such a controversial procedure beyond the boundaries which
Parliament has chosen to draw for its use thus far. It is controversial
precisely because it involves an invasion of the fundamental common law principles
to which I have referred. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The common law principles to which
I have referred are extremely important and should not be eroded unless there
is a compelling case for doing so. If this is to be done at all, it is better
done by Parliament after full consultation and proper consideration of the
sensitive issues involved. It is not surprising that Parliament has seen fit to
make provision for a closed material procedure in certain carefully defined
situations and has required the making of detailed procedural rules to give
effect to the legislation.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Relying on Lord Hoffmann’s speech in <i>R v Secretary of State
for the Home Department, Ex p Simms </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html">[2000] 2 AC 115</a>, Mr Jaffey submits that
Parliament cannot be taken to have intended to abrogate fundamental rights with
ambiguous, rather than express language. He submits that the principle of
legality applies to the present case with the result that the courts should
presume that, in the absence of clear express language or necessary
implication, the use of general words is nevertheless intended to be subject to
the basic rights of the individual. As a result, he submits, the words
“proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” in section 6, Justice and Security
Act 2013 should, if necessary, be given an expansive meaning so as to reduce
the scope of availability of the closed material procedure.</p>

</span>I readily accept that to hold a closed material hearing is a restriction
of the common law principles of open justice and natural justice. As this court
made clear in <i>Bank Mellat v Her Majesty’s Treasury (No 2)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2014] AC 700</a>
(per Lord Neuberger PSC, at paras 2-4, with whom Baroness Hale, Lord Clarke,
Lord Sumption and Lord Carnwath JJSC agreed), a closed hearing offends the
principle of open justice, which is fundamental to the dispensation of justice
in a modern, democratic society, and, by denying a party a right to know the
full case against him and the right to test and challenge that case fully, is
even more offensive to the fundamental principle of natural justice. While
these principles may, exceptionally, be required to yield if justice cannot
otherwise be achieved, claims that adherence to these principles is not
attainable in particular circumstances will always require the most intense
scrutiny.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am, however, unable to accept that the principle of legality has any
application to the specific issue raised on this appeal. In <i>Al-Rawi</i> this
court made clear that it was for Parliament and not the courts to determine
whether, and if so to what extent and with what safeguards, closed material
procedures should be permitted in order to accommodate the competing public
interests. Part 2 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 is one of the instances
in which Parliament has sought to perform this difficult exercise. It
necessarily involves an attempt to balance competing interests which are,
ultimately, irreconcilable. It comprises a detailed series of provisions which
incorporate a number of important safeguards. A court seised of relevant civil
proceedings may make a declaration that the proceedings are proceedings in
which a closed material application may be made to the court (section 6(1)). The
court may make such a declaration only if it is satisfied that a party to the
proceedings would be required to disclose sensitive material or would be so
required but for specific matters (“the first condition”) (section 6(4)) and
that it is in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice
in the proceedings to make a declaration (“the second condition”) (section
6(5)). “Sensitive material” is defined in section 6(11) as material the
disclosure of which would be damaging to the interests of national security.
The court must not consider an application for a declaration by the Secretary
of State unless satisfied that the Secretary of State has, before making the
application, considered whether to make or to advise another person to make a
claim for public interest immunity in relation to the relevant material
(section 6(7)). The effect of section 6(1) and 6(11) is to exclude “proceedings
in a criminal cause or matter” from the closed material procedure. Where a
court has made a declaration under section 6 it must keep the declaration under
review and may at any time revoke it if it considers that the declaration is no
longer in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice in
the proceedings (section 7(2)). The court must undertake a formal review of the
declaration once the pre-trial disclosure exercise in the proceedings has been
completed and must revoke it if it considers that the declaration is no longer
in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice in the
proceedings (section 7(3)). Section 14(2)(c) provides that nothing in the
statutory provisions establishing the closed material procedure is to be read
as requiring a court or tribunal to act in a manner inconsistent with article 6
ECHR.</a></p><a name="para41">

</span>In my view, this approach by the legislature leaves no scope for the
application of the principle of legality. A restrictive interpretation to
general words lest, as Lord Hoffmann put it in <i>Simms</i> (at p 131), “the
full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the
democratic process”, would be inappropriate here. On the contrary, the
elaborate scheme of Part 2 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 demonstrates
that Parliament was fully aware of the implications for civil liberties of the
exercise it was attempting to perform. This is Parliament’s assessment of the
appropriate balance. There is, therefore, no call for a narrow or restrictive
interpretation of these provisions, subject to the express provision in section
14(2)(c) requiring them to be read in a manner consistent with article 6 ECHR.
Appropriate safeguards are already built into the structure of the legislation.

</span>The exclusion by section 6(1) and 6(11) of “proceedings in a criminal

to operate as a safeguard. It will be necessary at a later point to consider
how wide a reading of those words is required or effective to achieve that
purpose. I am, however, unable to accept that the principle of legality can
require a broad reading of this exception so as to restrict the scope of the
procedure which is, in itself, Parliament’s proposed solution to the problem.</a></p><a name="para43">

</span>Mr Jaffey, on behalf of the appellants, draws attention to a line of
judicial authority on routes of appeal in which the courts have interpreted the
words “criminal cause or matter” in a succession of statutes starting with the
Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. By section 4 of the 1873 Act, the Supreme
Court was constituted in two divisions, the High Court of Justice and the Court
of Appeal. Section 47 which addressed the business of the High Court provided
in relevant part that “no appeal shall lie from any judgment of the said High
Court in any criminal cause or matter”. Section 100 included the following
definitions: </a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“‘Cause’ shall include an action,
suit, or other original proceeding between a plaintiff and a defendant, and any
criminal proceeding by the Crown.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">‘Action’ shall mean a civil
proceeding commenced by writ, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by
Rules of Court; and shall not include a criminal proceeding by the Crown.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">‘Matter’ shall include every
proceeding in the Court not in a cause.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This line of authority has been addressed in considerable
detail in the judgment of the Divisional Court. It is not necessary to do so
here as it is clear that, under the relevant legislation relating to routes of
appeal including the current provision in section 18(1)(a), Senior Courts Act
1981, proceedings such as the instant proceedings would be classified as
proceedings in a criminal cause or matter. Indeed, that is the basis on which
the Supreme Court has heard this appeal from the Queen’s Bench Division,
Divisional Court. For present purposes it is sufficient simply to refer to the
following examples of the application of the words in that context.</p>

permission pursuant to the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888 to bring proceedings
for criminal libel. The proposed defendant sought to appeal. This raised the
question whether the order was made in “criminal proceedings” within the Rules
of the Supreme Court. The Divisional Court, referring by analogy to section 47

</span>Challenges by way of judicial review to decisions to prosecute or not to
prosecute are heard by a Divisional Court and then, as a criminal cause or
matter, any appeal lies directly to the House of Lords. (<i>R v Director of
Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/43.html">[2000] 2 AC 326</a>; <i>R (Corner House

none of these cases was any point taken on jurisdiction, this well-established
usage is clearly correct.</p>

</span>Nevertheless, in my view the fact that the present proceedings are
proceedings in a “criminal cause or matter” within section 18(1)(a), Senior
Courts Act 1981 and previous legislation concerning routes of appeal does not
assist the Appellants on this appeal for two reasons.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, the principle enunciated by the House of Lords in <i>Barras</i>
applies only where, following a clear judicial interpretation of a word or
phrase in an earlier statute, a later statute incorporates the same word or
phrase in a similar context. This was expressly stated by Viscount Buckmaster
in his formulation of the principle (at p 411) cited above. (See also Viscount
Buckmaster at p 410; Lord Macmillan at p 446.) This presumption of
interpretation applies where the same language is used in a subsequent statute
dealing with the same subject matter. I also note that in <i>Barras</i> the
circumstances which supported the presumption were particularly strong. The
Merchant Shipping (International Labour Conventions) Act 1925 provided that a
seaman should be entitled to receive wages in certain circumstances where his
service was terminated by reason of “the wreck or loss of a ship” on which he
was employed. The stated purpose of the Act was to give effect to a draft
international convention, scheduled to the statute, which provided that the
indemnity against unemployment arose only where unemployment resulted from “the
loss or foundering” of the vessel. At the time of the passing of the 1925 Act
seamen enjoyed wider and more extended rights under the Merchant Shipping Act
1894 in case of “the wreck or loss of the ship”, as judicially interpreted,
than under the draft convention. As Viscount Buckmaster observed, at p 412, the
conclusion was plain that the Act, while intending to embody the draft convention,
did not intend to restrict or limit the rights which seamen already enjoyed
under the 1894 statute.</a></p><a name="para49">

</span>The context of the authorities on routes of appeal and the present
context are so very different that I find it impossible to derive any
assistance from those authorities. Moreover, it is apparent that there were
strong reasons for giving the phrase in question a particularly broad meaning
in the former context. As Irwin LJ observed in the Divisional Court in the
present case (at para 75), historically the caution shown in interpreting these
words must initially have been governed by the desire to avoid blurring the
lines of appeal and encroaching upon longstanding, discrete criminal
jurisdiction, recently subject to statutory reorganisation and reform.
Furthermore, there was an understandable reluctance on the part of a civil
court to entertain anything akin to an appeal in a criminal matter. Thus in <i>Ex
p Alice Woodhall</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1888/89.html">(1888) 20 QBD 832</a> we find the following statement in the
judgment of Lord Esher MR (at p 835):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The result of all the decided cases
is to shew that the words ‘criminal cause or matter’ in section 47 should
receive the widest possible interpretation. The intention was that no appeal
should lie in any ‘criminal matter’ in the widest sense of the term, this court
being constituted for the hearing of appeals in civil causes or matters.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, it is clear that the phrase “criminal cause or matter” need
not have one meaning but may be interpreted differently depending on its
statutory context. In <i>R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster
Magistrates’ Court</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1188.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 1188</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1188.html">[2011] 1 WLR 3253</a> a district judge
had refused an application by the applicant newspaper that it be provided with
copies of documents referred to but not read out in an open hearing in
extradition proceedings. The applicant sought judicial review of the decision
and appealed by way of case stated. The Divisional Court dismissed the claim
and the appeal. The Court of Appeal, (Lord Neuberger MR, Jackson and Aikens LJJ)
granting permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, considered that the
application had been wholly collateral to the extradition proceedings and that
the district judge’s order had not involved an exercise of his criminal
jurisdiction nor had it any bearing on the extradition proceedings.
Accordingly, it held that the Divisional Court’s judgment had not been made in
a criminal cause or matter within section 18(1)(a) of the Senior Courts Act
1981. In <i>R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates’
Court (No 2)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/420.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 420</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/420.html">[2013] QB 618</a>, the question arose whether
the previous decision had any impact on the powers of the Criminal Procedure
Rule Committee which under section 68 and 69 of the Courts Act 2003 are limited
to making rules in relation to the Crown Court and the Magistrates’ Court when
they are dealing with “any criminal cause or matter”. Hooper LJ concluded (at
para 106):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Mr Perry, rightly in my view,
said that the words ‘any criminal cause or matter’ must have a different
meaning in section 68 of the Courts Act 2003 than they do in section 18(1) of
the Senior Courts Act 1981. To give the words ‘any criminal cause or matter’ in
section 68 a narrow meaning would lead to the undesirable result that issues
such as those dealt with in Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules (and in
other parts of the Rules) would have to be the subject of rule-making by some
other body. That cannot have been the intention of Parliament: …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Neuberger MR agreed (at para 110):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I agree with what is said in para
106 that ‘criminal cause or matter’ in section 68(b) of the Courts Act 2003
does not necessarily have the same meaning as the identical expression in
section 18(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, and that, if the expression in the
1981 Act has the meaning ascribed to it in the earlier decision in this case …,
then it has a different meaning in the 2003 Act.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">(See also <i>Al Fawwaz v Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/468.html">[2015] EWHC 468 (Admin)</a> per Wyn Williams J at para 6.) If the
basis of the <i>Barras</i> principle is that Parliament must be assumed to be
aware of authoritative judicial decisions defining a particular word or phrase,
it must, as a result of <i>Guardian News (No 2)</i>, have been aware prior to
the enactment of the Justice and Security Act 2013 that “criminal cause or
matter” need not have one meaning but may be interpreted differently depending
on its statutory context. To my mind, this is fatal to the Appellants’ reliance
on the <i>Barras</i> principle.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Interpretation in the context of Justice and Security Act
2013</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Considering the words “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” in
their natural meaning and usage, it seems to me that “cause” is appropriate to
cover criminal proceedings which will result in a conviction or acquittal of a
criminal offence. The use of “matter” in the alternative may extend the scope
of the exclusion beyond that to ancillary applications in such criminal
proceedings, such as applications for disclosure, and to extradition
proceedings which do not in themselves result in a conviction or acquittal but
may be considered analogous to committal proceedings. In my view, however,
these words in their natural meaning do not extend to include this judicial
review. This is a public law challenge to a decision as to whether to initiate
criminal proceedings. It involves the scrutiny of the legality of the decision
on public law grounds and the application of principles of judicial review. The
application is made and heard in the Administrative Court. It is extraneous to
the criminal process. Even if it were to succeed, further steps would have to
be taken before criminal proceedings might begin. It is at, at least, one
remove from proceedings in a criminal cause or matter.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, necessary to consider the words in the context of this
particular statute and to consider the purpose of the exclusion of “proceedings
in a criminal cause or matter” from this closed material procedure. Here, it is
permissible to refer to the Justice and Security Green Paper Cm 8194/2011,
which preceded the Justice and Security Act 2013 and to the Explanatory Notes
to the Bill and the Act in order to cast light on the contextual setting and in
order to give a purposive interpretation of the legislation (<i>Fothergill v
Monarch Airlines</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/6.html">[1981] AC 251</a> per Lord Diplock at p 281; <i>R (Westminster
City Council) v National Asylum Support Service</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/38.html">[2002] UKHL 38</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/38.html">[2002] 1 WLR 2956</a> per Lord Steyn at para 5). The Green Paper states that its proposals
are aimed to “better equip our courts to pass judgment in cases involving
sensitive information” and to “protect UK national security by preventing
damaging disclosure of genuinely national security sensitive material”
(Foreword). An indication of the purpose of the specific exclusion of
proceedings in a criminal cause or matter from the new procedure is provided by
the following passage (at p 7):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Criminal vs Civil: Why criminal
proceedings are out of scope for this Paper Civil and Criminal proceedings in
England and Wales are fundamentally different. In civil cases, the courts
adjudicate on disputes between parties under the civil law. In criminal cases,
it is usually the state which prosecutes individuals for the commission of
criminal offences; where defendants are convicted, they face criminal sanctions
including imprisonment. Due to the understandably more onerous requirements of
the right to a fair trial in criminal cases, the rules concerning the use and
protection of sensitive evidence are different to those in civil cases.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Criminal proceedings have the strictest
requirements under article 6 of the ECHR regarding the disclosure of sensitive
material. Long-standing procedures, generally supported by all parties, are in
place:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence that the
prosecutor uses in court to secure a conviction is never withheld from the
accused. …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The passage then refers to disclosure to an accused of
all relevant material, the use of public interest immunity procedures, the
power of the court to overrule a public interest immunity certificate and the
discretion which would permit a prosecutor to withdraw a prosecution rather
than disclose sensitive material. It then states:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In civil claims, as [Her
Majesty’s Government] is a defendant, there is no possibility of withdrawing
from the case, so the ability to protect sensitive material is entirely
dependent on PII claims.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In addition, a glossary (at p 68) which distinguishes
civil and criminal proceedings, reinforces the view that the purpose of the
exclusion is to prevent its use in criminal proceedings:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Civil proceedings</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">For the purposes of this Green
Paper any court or tribunal proceedings which are not criminal in nature are
referred to as civil proceedings. Civil proceedings include, but are not
limited to, areas such as public law (ie judicial review), negligence, family
law, employment law, property law and commercial law.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">By contrast, criminal proceedings
involve an accusation by the state (or in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
occasionally by way of private prosecution) that the accused has committed a
breach of the criminal law which, if proved, would lead to conviction and the
imposition of a sentence. Crimes are generally wrongs which affect the public
as a whole, so that the public has an interest in their detection and
punishment.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It then concludes with the statement that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The proposals outlined in the
Paper do not affect criminal proceedings” (at p 68).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Explanatory Notes to the Justice and Security Bill, clause 6(7)
provided:</a></p><a name="para54">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection (7) defines
‘relevant civil proceedings’. This sets the range of civil proceedings in which
a declaration under subsection (1) may be made. ‘Relevant civil proceedings’
are defined as proceedings in the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Court
of Session which are not criminal proceedings.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Explanatory Notes to the Justice and Security Act
2013 simply states:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 6 enables certain
courts hearing civil (but not criminal) proceedings, namely the High Court, the
Court of Appeal, the Court of Session or the Supreme Court, to make a
declaration that the case is one in which a closed material application may be
made in relation to specific pieces of material.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I see the force of the point that if the full extent of the intention of
Parliament had been that the new procedure should not affect criminal proceedings,
it would have been open to it simply to exclude the use of this closed material
procedure in “criminal proceedings”. Nevertheless, the Green Paper provides two
compelling reasons why the new procedure should not be available in proceedings
which may result in a conviction or an acquittal. First, the objections to a
person being convicted of a criminal offence on the basis of secret evidence
which has not been disclosed to him or his legal representatives are obvious.
Secondly, the obligations of the United Kingdom under article 6 ECHR are more
onerous in their application to criminal proceedings which may result in a
conviction or acquittal. However, neither of these reasons has any application
here and neither would justify denying the use of the new procedure in the
present application for judicial review of the Director’s decision. The Green
Paper also draws attention to the fact that the Director has control over a
criminal prosecution with the result that it is open to her to choose to discontinue
a prosecution rather than disclose sensitive national security material. By
contrast, the Director is the defendant in this judicial review and therefore
has a responsive role; she has no power to withdraw these proceedings in order
to prevent the disclosure of such material. Moreover, no reason of principle
has been advanced as to why the closed material procedure should not be
available when the Administrative Court hears the present application for
judicial review. On the contrary, it is apparent that the conflict between the
principles of open justice and natural justice, on the one hand, and the need
to protect national security on the other, arises in a particularly acute form
in judicial review proceedings to which the application of the detailed
compromise drawn by Parliament in Part 2 of the Justice and Security Act 2013
is particularly appropriate.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I should add that I do not share Lord Mance’s view that the rationale
for the exclusion from the closed material procedure of “proceedings in a criminal
cause or matter” is readily applicable or transposable to the context of a
challenge by judicial review to a decision to prosecute, a hypothesis which he
uses as a stepping stone to his conclusion. If there is material which is
potentially incriminating, a closed material procedure would be pointless, as
he accepts, as it could not be used at trial. If, on the other hand, there is
material which is potentially exculpatory, a closed material procedure would be
equally pointless because it would have to be disclosed at trial or the
prosecution abandoned. This does not suggest any need to exclude the closed
material procedure in a judicial review of a decision to prosecute in order to
achieve the objective of the exclusion. On the other hand, as the present case
shows, there may well be purpose in making the closed material procedure
available in a challenge to a decision not to prosecute and the rationale for
exclusion has no application here.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I accept the submission of Mr James Eadie QC that the core concern which
lies behind this provision is that this closed material procedure should not be
available in any case where criminal guilt is being decided. The present
proceedings, however, are at, at least, one remove from a criminal cause or
matter and the court is performing the function of determining the legality of
the conduct of the decision maker. (See the observations of Wyn Williams J in <i>Al
Fawwaz</i>, at para 7, to similar effect.) These proceedings do not fall within
the purpose of the exclusion. Here, proceedings challenging a decision not to
prosecute are not themselves proceedings in a criminal cause or matter for the
purpose of section 6 Justice and Security Act 2013. Accordingly, I would have
dismissed this appeal.</a></p><a name="para57">
