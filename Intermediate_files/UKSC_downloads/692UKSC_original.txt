State for the Home Department concerns five individuals, the respondents, who
arrived in the United Kingdom illegally and claimed asylum. Inquiries revealed
that they had travelled to the United Kingdom via at least one other member
state of the European Union in which they had already claimed asylum and so the
Secretary of State requested those states to take responsibility for examining
the asylum claims pursuant to Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) No
604/2013 of 26 June 2013 (“the Dublin III Regulation”, “Dublin III” or “the
Regulation”). Ultimately each such state agreed to take the relevant respondent
back for that purpose.</span></a></p><a name="para1">

Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. The Secretary of State had published
her policy in relation to detention pending removal in Chapter 55 of her
Enforcement Instructions and Guidance (23 October 2015) (“the EIG”). This
appeal now gives rise to important questions concerning the requirements
imposed on member states by the Dublin III Regulation, whether the policy in
Chapter 55 of the EIG meets those requirements and, so far as it fails to do
so, the consequences of that failure. The particular questions which must be
decided are:</span></a></p><a name="para2">

respondent, is a national of Iran and arrived in the United Kingdom illegally
by lorry. On 11 February 2015 she presented herself to the authorities and
claimed asylum. A check revealed that she had already claimed asylum in Bulgaria.
The United Kingdom proceeded formally to request Bulgaria under the Dublin III
procedure to take responsibility for the asylum claim and on 17 April 2015
Bulgaria agreed to do so. On 8 June 2015 she was detained in order to effect
her removal to Bulgaria and, according to the evidence of the Secretary of
State, on the basis she posed a risk of absconding. Removal directions were set
for 7 July 2015. These were cancelled when she gave notice that she had issued
judicial review proceedings to challenge the decision to remove her. She
contended that removal would give rise to a real risk of a violation of her
rights under article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the ECHR”). She was released on 17 July 2015.
She was therefore detained from 8 June 2015 to 17 July 2015.</span></a></p><a name="para3">

respondent, is a national of Afghanistan. He arrived in the United Kingdom
illegally by lorry. On 20 November 2014 he presented himself to the authorities
and claimed asylum. He was initially released on temporary admission. On 6
January 2015 he attended a screening interview and made a formal in-country
claim for asylum. He was detained on the basis that his removal was imminent,
that he had behaved deceptively and, according to the evidence of the Secretary
of State, that he posed a risk of absconding. A check revealed that he too had
already made an asylum claim in Bulgaria. The United Kingdom proceeded formally
to request Bulgaria under the Dublin III procedure to take responsibility for
the asylum claim and on 12 February 2015 Bulgaria agreed to do so. Removal
directions were set for 23 February 2015.</span></a></p><a name="para4">

2015, the second respondent made submissions to the Secretary of State that his
removal would breach his rights under article 3 of the ECHR and on 20 February
2015 he issued a claim for judicial review to prevent his scheduled removal.
The removal directions were cancelled and on 9 March 2015 he was granted bail
by the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”). He claims that his detention became
unlawful on 5 February 2015, the date he complained that his removal to
Bulgaria would be incompatible with article 3 of the ECHR. The relevant period
of his detention was therefore 5 February 2015 to 9 March 2015.</span></a></p><a name="para5">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Jamal Abdulkadir, the third
respondent, is a national of Iraq. On 18 August 2015 he arrived in the United
Kingdom illegally by lorry. Upon arrival in Kent, he ran from the lorry but was
apprehended and detained. The Secretary of State maintains that the evidence he
produced of his identity was inadequate and that there was a risk he would
abscond. A check revealed that he had made an asylum claim in Austria in July
2015. At this point he claimed asylum in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom
proceeded formally to request Austria under the Dublin III procedure to take
responsibility for the asylum claim and on 15 September 2015 Austria agreed to
do so. On 28 September 2015 removal directions were set but later cancelled at
Austria’s request. Further removal directions were set for 23 October 2015. On 22
October 2015 the third respondent issued judicial review proceedings
challenging the decision to remove him on the basis that </span></a><a name="_Hlk17798587">in
Austria he would be exposed to a real risk of violation of his rights under
article 3 of the ECHR</a>. He made an application for bail which the FTT
refused on 13 November on the basis that there was a risk he would abscond and
that it was likely he would be removed in a short time. On 27 November 2015 he
was given permission to apply for judicial review and on 8 December 2015, upon
review of his detention, he was released. He was therefore detained from 18
August 2015 to 8 December 2015.</p>

but was apprehended later that day. He claimed asylum and, according to the
evidence of the Secretary of State, was detained on the basis he posed a risk
of absconding. A check revealed that he had previously claimed asylum in
Austria. The United Kingdom proceeded formally to request Austria under the
Dublin III procedure to take responsibility for the asylum claim and on 15
September 2015 Austria agreed to do so. Removal directions were set for 12
October 2015 but on 2 October 2015 he began proceedings for judicial review
claiming, among other things, that in Austria he would be exposed to a real
risk of violation of his rights under article 3 of the ECHR. He was released
from detention on 4 November 2015. He was therefore detained from 8 September

national of Afghanistan. On 15 September 2015 he arrived in the United Kingdom
illegally and by hiding in the back of a train. Upon arrival he claimed asylum
and pretended to be a child. A check revealed he had already claimed asylum in </span></a><a name="_Hlk16762778">Bulgaria, Hungary and Germany</a>. He was detained on that
same day on the basis that it was reasonably likely that he would be accepted
by another member state under the Dublin III procedure. A month later a notice
of detention review stated that it had been decided he should remain in
detention because there was reason to believe he would not comply with any
conditions of release. The United Kingdom proceeded formally to request

by the fifth respondent came on for hearing before Mr John Howell QC, sitting
as a deputy High Court judge. The original grounds of claim focused on the
assertion by the fifth respondent that he was a child and therefore could not
be removed to Germany under the Dublin III scheme. But at the hearing he was
permitted to amend his claim to introduce a further claim that he was
unlawfully detained because his detention was contrary to articles 28(2) and
2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation. The deputy judge gave judgment on 26 May
2017 (</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/1295.html">[2017] EWHC 1295 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/1295.html">[2017] 1 WLR 3641</a>). He found that that the
fifth respondent was not a child when he was detained. However, he also found
that the fifth respondent had been detained to secure his transfer to the
responsible member state under the Dublin III scheme; that it had to be
established that he posed a significant risk of absconding; and that his
detention was unlawful because, even if he posed a significant risk of
absconding, his detention was in conflict with articles 28(2) and 2(n).</p>

the first four claims and the Secretary of State in the fifth appealed to the
Court of Appeal. The principal issues before the court concerned the meaning

particular, whether the application of the principles explained in <i>R v
Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/1983/1.html">[1984] 1 WLR 704</a> or the

imprisonment or under European Union law pursuant to the <i>Factortame</i>
principle. It is important to note that the Court of Appeal was asked to decide
these issues on the agreed assumption that the only ground for detaining the
respondents was that the Secretary of State wished to remove them using the
Dublin III procedure. The position remains the same on this further appeal.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para14"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeal, by a majority
(Sir Terence Etherton MR and Peter Jackson LJ), allowed the appeals of the
first to fourth respondents and dismissed the appeal of the Secretary of State
in the case of the fifth respondent. Critical to the reasoning of the majority
was the decision of the second chamber of the Court of Justice of the European
Union (the “CJEU”) in <i>Policie ČR, Krajské ředitelství policie
Ústeckého kraje, odbor cizinecké policie v Al Chodor</i> (Case C-528/15) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C52815.html">[2017] 4 WLR 125</a>. This decision post-dated the decisions of Garnham J and Irwin J but
predated that of Mr John Howell QC. The majority held that the touchstone
applied by the CJEU in <i>Al Chodor </i>for assessing compliance with articles
28(2) and 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation was whether the provisions relied
upon for detention had the requisite legal basis and the safeguards of clarity,
predictability, accessibility and protection against arbitrariness within a
framework of certain predetermined limits. The majority also held that it was
clear that neither the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles nor the Secretary of
State’s published policy in Chapter 55 of the EIG satisfied these requirements.
It followed that the detention of all of the respondents was in breach of
article 28(2).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></a></span><a name="para15"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The majority of the Court of
Appeal went on to hold that each of the respondents had established all of the
necessary ingredients of the common law cause of action for wrongful
imprisonment. They had all been detained and that detention was unlawful
because it was effected pursuant to the policy in Chapter 55 of the EIG, and
that was itself unlawful in so far as it failed to give effect to articles
28(2) and 2(n) of the Regulation. The respondents were therefore entitled to
damages for false imprisonment. The <i>Factortame</i> principle had no
relevance because the individual right of each person to liberty existed save
in so far as it is legitimately cut down by law. The appeals did not concern
infringement of rights which were to be found only in European Union law.
Further, it was not necessary to consider the additional and discrete claims by
the first and second respondents for false imprisonment based upon the alleged
breach by the Secretary of State of the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles.</span></a></p><a name="para15">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Sales LJ, dissenting, held that a
policy statement such as that contained in Chapter 55 of the EIG was in
principle capable of satisfying the requirements of articles 28(2) and 2(n) of
the Dublin III Regulation, and that here it did satisfy those requirements.
However, conscious that he was in the minority on this issue, he went on to
consider whether, on the footing that he was wrong, the respondents were
entitled to damages. He concluded that they were not. </span></a><a name="_Hlk20234605">In
his view, the claim turned on the alleged failure by the United Kingdom to
adopt a particular form of law when implementing articles 28(2) and 2(n). In
these circumstances the proper approach in considering whether the Secretary of
State was liable for damages was to ask whether the relevant criteria for an
award of damages in respect of a breach of European law had been satisfied and,
in particular, whether the breach was sufficiently serious within the meaning
of the decision of the CJEU in <i>Factortame</i>, that is to say whether the
member state had manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits of its discretion.
Here, any breach of articles 28(2) and 2(n) did not satisfy that “sufficiently
serious” test.</a></p>

based upon a breach of the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles. In his view there
was nothing in them, and in this regard he agreed with the decision of Garnham
J: the first and second respondents were detained for proper reasons; they were
assessed as posing a risk of absconding and that assessment was rational and justified;
and throughout the period of their detention, there remained a real prospect
that they would be removed eventually.</span></a></p><a name="para17">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The European Union has for some
time sought to establish an area of freedom, security and justice which is open
to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek its protection. To
this end the Union has harmonised the procedures and substantive rules of
refugee law and, as part of that harmonisation, established a body of law
within what is known as the Common European Asylum System (the “CEAS”). A
well-functioning Dublin system is seen as essential to the CEAS in ensuring the
rapid identification of the member state responsible for examining an
application for international protection, and in this way guaranteeing
effective access to the procedures for determining refugee status. The Dublin
III Regulation replaced Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003
establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state
responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member
states by a third country national (“the Dublin II Regulation”). Dublin III
lays down, in Chapter III, a hierarchy of criteria for identifying the member
state responsible for deciding the claim. If the member state where an asylum
claim has been lodged considers that another member state is responsible then
it may ask the other member state to take charge of the applicant. If the other
member state agrees to this request, the first member state will transfer the
applicant there in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Regulation.</span></a></p><a name="para19">

travelled to the Czech Republic via Turkey, Greece and then Hungary, where they
had claimed asylum. The Foreigners Police Section of the Czech police force
decided to place the family in detention pending their transfer to Hungary
under the Dublin system. They took the view, for perfectly sensible reasons,
that there was a serious risk that, unless detained, the Al Chodors would
abscond before their transfer. The relevant Czech legislation conferred on the
police force the power to detain a foreign national who had entered the Czech
Republic illegally for the period of time necessary to secure the transfer of
that person in accordance with, among other measures, the Dublin III
Regulation. Upon a challenge by the Al Chodors, the Czech Regional Court
annulled the decision to detain on the basis that the objective criteria for
assessing the risk of absconding were not defined by Czech legislation as
required by article 2(n) of the Regulation. The police force then brought an
appeal on a point of law before the Supreme Administrative Court, which made
the reference to the CJEU.</span></a></p><a name="para27">

that while the French and German versions required a definition, laid down in
legislation, of the objective criteria for the purposes of absconding, other
versions required a definition of those criteria by law in the general sense.
As a result, the meaning of the term “defined by law” did not follow clearly
from the wording of the provision. The referring court therefore asked, in
substance, whether articles 2(n) and 28(2) of the Dublin III Regulation require
member states to establish, in a national law, objective criteria underlying
the reasons for believing that an applicant for international protection who is
subject to a transfer procedure may abscond, and whether the absence of those
criteria in a national law leads to the inapplicability of article 28(2).</span></a></p><a name="para29">

considered that the concept of “law” as referred to in article 2(n) of Dublin
III, read in context and in light of its purpose, had a meaning which was
different from that of the concept of “law” in the ECHR; that the provisions of
the ECHR established a minimum level of protection and did not exclude the possibility
that European Union law might provide more extensive protection; that the
European Union legislature had indeed chosen to provide more extensive
protection than that arising from article 5(1) of the ECHR; and that the
criteria had to be laid down in legislation (Opinion, paras 42-45). He then
proceeded to explain his reasons for these views.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></a></span><a name="para32"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Advocate General began with
his reasons for believing that the Dublin III Regulation and the recast
Reception Directive were intended to extend the protection afforded to
applicants (Opinion, paras 46-58). He pointed out that before these instruments
there was only minimal regulation of applicants’ detention. By contrast and as
stated in recital 15 of the recast Reception Directive, the European Union
legislature intended that detention of such persons under the new regime should
be limited to exceptional circumstances. He also explained that the freedom of
member states to detain applicants was already subject to the restrictions
imposed by article 5(1)(f) of the ECHR and that the compliance of a detention
measure with this provision was not conditional on there being a risk of
absconding or the absence of other less restrictive measures enabling the
removal of the person concerned. In his view, in adopting the Dublin III
Regulation and the recast Reception Directive, the legislature intended to
provide more extensive protection than that arising from article 5(1)(f). His
reasons were twofold: first, article 28(2) of Dublin III permitted detention
only where there was a significant risk of absconding; and secondly, article
28(2) of Dublin III and article 8(2) of the recast Reception Directive provided
that detention was a measure of last resort and might be taken only in the
absence of less coercive alternative measures.</span></a></p><a name="para32">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Two objectives of the requirement
that the criteria for assessing the risk of absconding must be defined by law
were identified by the Advocate General (Opinion, paras 59-70). The first was
to ensure that the criteria offered sufficient guarantees of legal certainty,
as that concept is understood in European Union law (Opinion, para 62). The
second was to ensure that the discretion enjoyed “by the individual authorities
responsible for applying the criteria” was exercised within “a framework of
certain pre-determined markers” (Opinion, para 63). In the Advocate General’s
view, the achievement of each of these objectives was dependent on the
objective criteria for the assessment of the risk of an applicant absconding
being defined in a legislative text. Legal certainty demanded that individuals
should be able to ascertain the scope of their rights and obligations and
foresee the consequences of their actions. This requirement had not been
satisfied in the instant case because the Czech case law was fragmentary, and
the relevant administrative practice could be altered at will and had not been
publicised (Opinion, paras 72-80). As for the objective of circumscribing the
discretion of the administrative and judicial authorities, the adoption of
legislation, in addition to providing advantages in terms of legal certainty,
offered additional assurances in terms of external control of the discretion of
the administrative and judicial authorities responsible for assessing the risk
of absconding and, where appropriate, ordering detention (Opinion, para 81).
Interference with liberty should be limited to exceptional circumstances; the
discretion of the authorities should be circumscribed in such a way as to guard
applicants against arbitrary deprivations of liberty; and, from this
perspective, it was important that the criteria and their application should be
determined by institutionally separate authorities (Opinion, para 82). The
twofold requirement inherent in article 2(n), for an individual assessment and
for the assessment to be based upon pre-defined, objective criteria, required
the administrative and judicial authorities to take the circumstances of each
case into consideration; and further, it ensured that the discretion of the
individual authority was channelled by means of “general, abstract criteria
that have been determined in advance by a third authority” (Opinion, para 83).</span></a></p><a name="para33">

Regulation was directly applicable in member states and did not require
transposition into national law. Thus, it was argued, article 2(n) did not
require national legislatures to implement the objective criteria in national
law. The court rejected this submission, observing, at para 28, that article
2(n) required that objective criteria defining the existence of a risk of
absconding be “defined by law”. Since these criteria had been established
neither by Dublin III nor in any other European Union legal act, the
elaboration of those criteria was a matter for national law.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para35"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The CJEU turned next to the
question whether “law” in article 2(n) included settled case law which
confirmed a consistent administrative practice. It explained, at paras 30 to
32, that a textual analysis did not provide an answer and that the provision
had to be interpreted by reference to the purpose and the general scheme of the
rules of which it formed a part. Here, the court continued, at paras 34 and 35,
it was relevant that the Regulation was intended to make improvements to the
effectiveness of the Dublin system but also to the protection afforded to
applicants. Indeed, the high level of protection now afforded to applicants was
apparent from the terms of articles 28 and 2(n), the requirement in article
2(n) that a finding of a risk of absconding must be based upon objective
criteria defined by law and applied on a case by case basis, and the fact that
its predecessor, the Dublin II Regulation, did not contain any provision
relating to detention.</span></a></p><a name="para35">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The CJEU also thought it relevant
that, by authorising the detention of applicants in order to secure their
effective transfer under the Dublin III regime, the Regulation was authorising
a limitation on the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in article 6 of the
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> (“the Charter”), and
account also had to be taken of article 5 of the ECHR as providing the minimum
threshold of protection. The court reasoned that any law authorising the
deprivation of liberty must therefore be sufficiently accessible, precise and
foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (para 38);
that there must be no element of bad faith or deception on the part of the
authorities (para 39); and that the detention of applicants, constituting, as
it does, a serious interference with their liberty, is subject to strict
safeguards, namely the presence of a legal basis, clarity, predictability,
accessibility and protection against arbitrariness (para 40).</p>

regard to the first of those safeguards, it must be recalled that the
limitation on the exercise of the right to liberty is based, in the present
case, on article 28(2) of the Dublin III Regulation, read in conjunction with
article 2(n) thereof, which is a legislative act of the European Union. The
latter provision refers, in turn, to national law for the definition of the
objective criteria indicating the presence of a risk of absconding. In that
context, the question arises as to what type of provision addresses the other
safeguards, namely those of clarity, predictability, accessibility and
protection against arbitrariness.</span></p>

it is important that the individual discretion enjoyed by the authorities
concerned pursuant to article 28(2) of the Dublin III Regulation, read in
conjunction with article 2(n) thereof, in relation to the existence of a risk
of absconding, should be exercised within a framework of certain predetermined
limits. Accordingly, it is essential that the criteria which define the
existence of such a risk, which constitute the basis for detention, are defined
clearly by an act which is binding and foreseeable in its application.</p>

General noted in points 81 and 82 of his Opinion <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C52815.html">EU:C:2016:865</a>, criteria

pending a decision whether to give directions for his or her removal, and
pending removal pursuant to any such directions. Similar powers are conferred
on the Secretary of State by section 62(1) and section 62(2)(c) and (d) of the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2 to
the 1971 Act provides that, in exercising their functions under the 1971 Act,
immigration officers must act in accordance with such instructions as may be
given to them by the Secretary of State.</span></a></p><a name="para40">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is rightly accepted by the
Secretary of State that there are limits to these powers to detain. First, they
are subject to the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles. These are well known and
may be summarised as follows: (i) the Secretary of State must intend to deport
the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose; (ii) the
person may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the
circumstances; (iii) if, before the expiry of the relevant period, it becomes
apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation
within a reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of
detention; and (iv) the Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence
and expedition to effect the removal: see <i>R (I) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/888.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 888</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/888.html">[2003] INLR 196</a>; affirmed as common

public law duties to act consistently with the purpose of the legislation and
reasonably in the <i>Wednesbury</i> sense: <i>Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corpn</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html">[1948] 1 KB 223</a>. But, as Lord Dyson &nbsp;observed

would be no room for a public law duty of adherence to a published policy, to
which I will come in a moment.</p>

Lord Dyson explained in <i>Lumba</i>, at para 66, a purported lawful authority
to detain may be impugned either because the defendant has acted in excess of
jurisdiction or because the jurisdiction has been wrongly exercised. Both
species of error render an executive act ultra vires, unlawful and a nullity.
There is in this context no difference between a detention which is unlawful
because there was no statutory power to detain and a detention which is
unlawful because the decision to detain, although authorised by the statute,

at para 42, the published policy in that case narrowed the power of the
executive to detain by requiring that any detention be reviewed regularly, and
so it was an abuse of the power for any person to be detained if that detention
was not reviewed at regular intervals. Lord Hope continued, at paras 51 and 52,
that the policy was designed to give practical effect to the <i>Hardial Singh</i>
principles and to meet the requirement that, to be lawful, the measures had to
be transparent and not arbitrary; that the policy contained a set of
instructions with which officials were expected to comply; that the policy and
the principles went “hand in hand”; and that the discretion to continue
detention had to be exercised in accordance with the principles but also in accordance

CJEU in <i>Al Chodor</i> and consistently with the ECHR and the Charter,
articles 28(2) and 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation demand that the detention
of applicants, constituting, as such detention does, a serious interference
with their right to liberty, is subject to compliance with the strict
safeguards of “<i>legal basis, clarity, predictability, accessibility and
protection against arbitrariness</i>” (<i>Al Chodor</i>, para 40). The first of
these safeguards requires national law to define “<i>objective criteria
indicating the presence of a risk of absconding</i>”<i> </i>(<i>Al Chodor</i>,
para 41). The others demand that the assessment is carried out within a “<i>framework
of certain predetermined limits</i>”</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> and
that the “<i>objective criteria</i>” are defined “<i>clearly by an act which is
binding and foreseeable in its application</i>” (<i>Al Chodor</i>, para 42) and
are established in a “<i>binding provision of general application</i>” (<i>Al
Chodor</i>, para 45). The adoption of such a provision of general application
provides the necessary safeguards in so far as its wording sets out the “<i>limits
of the flexibility of </i>[the]<i> authorities in the assessment of the
circumstances of each specific case</i>” in a manner which is “<i>binding and
known in advance</i>” (<i>Al Chodor</i>, para 44). The CJEU accordingly ruled
that member states are required to establish, in a binding provision of general
application, objective criteria underlying the reasons for believing that an
applicant for international protection who is subject to a transfer procedure
may abscond.</span></a></p><a name="para53">

importance. As we have seen, the Dublin III Regulation was intended to improve
not only the effectiveness of the Dublin system but also to confer a high level

significant limitations on the powers of member states to detain them. The
Regulation was also intended to provide greater guarantees in relation to
detention than its predecessor, the Dublin II Regulation.</span></a></p><a name="para54">

that, within the taxonomy of English law, Chapter 55 of the EIG cannot be

that decision-makers have legal obligations, imposed by settled case law, to
comply with them. It is submitted that the policy contained in Chapter 55
constitutes a clear statement by the executive of the circumstances in which
the statutory criteria will be exercised; that they are objective and publicly
accessible; and that their meaning will, if necessary, be determined by the
court. It is also argued that Chapter 55 and domestic case law are integral
parts of the law that governs and limits the power to detain and that together
they define how the power to detain must be exercised and set out the objective
criteria which decision-makers must apply when exercising that power. Consequently,
the submission continues, the combination of Chapter 55 and domestic case law
ensures that any decision to detain is exercised within a framework of certain
predetermined limits and according to criteria established by binding
provisions of general application which meet the requirements of clarity,
predictability, accessibility and protection against arbitrariness explained by
the CJEU in <i>Al Chodor</i>.</span></a></p><a name="para55">

to the issues set out in para 18(i) above. The majority of the Court of Appeal
addressed those issues in two stages. They considered first, whether the
contents of Chapter 55 of the EIG met the requirement that the criteria for the
assessment of the risk of absconding must be “clear, predictable and
accessible”, and whether they constituted a “framework of certain predetermined
limits”; and secondly whether Chapter 55, though not legislation and even
though capable of being changed at any time by the Secretary of State without
being subject to parliamentary scrutiny or consultation, provided the necessary
predictability and amounted to a “binding provision of general application” as
referred to by the CJEU in <i>Al Chodor</i> and constituted a defining “law” as
required by article 2(n). I propose to adopt the same course.</span></a></p><a name="para56">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As we have seen, Chapter 55 of the
EIG contains the Secretary of State’s policy in relation to detention pending
removal. However, it is not a policy which is specifically directed to the
detention of persons subject to a Dublin procedure. Indeed, as the majority in
the Court of Appeal observed, it contains no reference to Dublin III at all. In
these circumstances it comes as no surprise that it makes no reference to the
requirement that a person is not to be detained for the sole reason that he or
she is subject to a Dublin procedure; nor does it say that the only permissible
basis for detaining such a person is that there is a significant risk of
absconding. Further, there is no direction that detention must be proportional.</span></a></p><a name="para57">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I accept that paragraph 55.1.1 of
Chapter 55 states that, in considering the power to detain, there is a
presumption in favour of immigration bail and that, where possible,
alternatives to detention should be used. It also states that detention is most
usually appropriate to effect removal, initially to establish a person’s
identity or basis of claim or where there is reason to believe that a person
will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of immigration
bail. So too, paragraph 55.1.3 makes clear that detention must be used
sparingly and for the shortest necessary period; and paragraph 55.1.4 says that
detention must be for one of the statutory purposes for which the power is
given and must comply with the limitations imposed by domestic and ECHR case
law. But all of this amounts to no more than general guidance as to how the
power to detain is to be exercised and does not constitute a set of objective
criteria against which the risk of absconding is to be assessed. Nor does it
set out the limits of the flexibility of the authorities in the assessment of
the particular circumstances of each case in a manner which is binding and
known in advance.</span></a></p><a name="para58">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Paragraph 55.1.4.1 of Chapter 55
sets out the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles but, as the majority of the Court
of Appeal explained at paras 167 to 169, by the end of the hearing before them
it appeared not to be in dispute that these principles were insufficient to
satisfy the requirements of articles 28(2) and 2(n). Nevertheless, the majority
in the Court of Appeal went on to explain why that was in any event their view,
and it is a view which I share. In short, the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles
require the power to detain to be exercised reasonably and for the prescribed
purpose of facilitating deportation: see, for example, <i>Lumba</i>, para 30,
per Lord Dyson. But they do not constitute objective criteria on the basis of
which an assessment may be made as to the likelihood that a person who is
subject to a transfer procedure may abscond.</span></a></p><a name="para59">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State places
particular reliance on paragraphs 55.3 and 55.3.1 of the EIG. Paragraph 55.3
does no more than set out further general guidance to the effect that, for
detention to be justified, there must be strong grounds for believing a person
will not comply with conditions of temporary admission or temporary release;
that all reasonable alternatives to detention have been assessed; and that each
case has been considered on its merits, with due regard to the need to
safeguard and promote the welfare of any children involved. The Secretary of
State therefore focuses on the criteria set out in paragraph 55.3.1 and
contends these are objective and publicly accessible and that their meaning
will, if necessary, be determined by the court. It is also argued that they
have formed the basis of detention decisions for many years and are well known
and well understood by asylum seekers and the courts. So too, the argument
continues, binding guidance as to the application of these criteria is set out
in case law, and the courts have ensured that the decision-making process is
transparent. The Secretary of State accepts that this list relates not just to
Dublin III cases but also to all other cases in which it may be appropriate to
consider detention for immigration purposes but contends this is not
incompatible with article 2(n). It is submitted that this article does not say
that the objective criteria have to be set out in a separate stand-alone
document focused exclusively on article 28, nor that there has to be an express
reference to that provision. Further, an individual who is subject to the
Dublin III procedure can readily identify which of the criteria in the list are
relevant to any assessment of whether he poses a risk of absconding.</span></a></p><a name="para60">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I do not find these submissions
persuasive. Paragraph 55.3.1 sets out 11 factors which may be relevant in
considering the need for initial or continued detention. It does not purport to
be a list of criteria for assessing whether a person in a Dublin III procedure
may abscond. Further, it is not an exhaustive list for, as its opening words
make clear, all relevant factors are to be taken into account. As for the list
itself, only one factor, the second, refers in terms to absconding. Some of the
others might be relevant to a risk of absconding but might also be relevant to
the need for detention for different purposes underpinned by different policy
considerations. In the case of the last three (whether the subject is under 18,
whether the subject has a history of torture and whether the subject has a
history of physical or mental ill health), it is hard to see their relevance to
a risk of absconding at all. In the result, persons subject to a Dublin III
procedure cannot know which criteria will be used for the basis of an
assessment whether they are likely to abscond and cannot identify the limits of
the flexibility of the relevant authorities in carrying out their evaluation.
In my judgement a provision such as this does not constitute a framework of
certain predetermined limits for assessing whether a person in a Dublin III
procedure is likely to abscond, does not identify the criteria which are to
form the basis of the assessment and does not set out the limits of the
flexibility of the authorities in a manner which is binding and known in
advance. Nor is there any evidence or finding that asylum seekers were aware of
the provisions of the Dublin III Regulation or the existence or significance of
the <i>Al Chodor</i> decision and so could in some way factor these matters
into their understanding of the assessment processes to which they were
subjected.</span></a></p><a name="para61">

to the subsequent legislative history and submits this shows how little
difference formal compliance with any requirement for secondary legislation
would make. On the 15 March 2017, the day the CJEU gave judgment in <i>Al
Chodor</i>, the Secretary of State made the Transfer for Determination of an
Application for International Protection (Detention) (Significant Risk of
Absconding Criteria) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/405) (“the 2017 Regulations”).

that these criteria reflect the relevant bullet points referred to in paragraph

these terms. This, so it is said, shows how technical and formal the following
argument of the respondents is: promulgation of the criteria by means of a
policy such as the EIG does not comply with articles 28(2) and 2(n), yet the
making of secondary legislation in the same terms by the Secretary of State
alone and without any Parliamentary scrutiny does comply with them.</span></a></p><a name="para63">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It will be appreciated that this
argument is primarily directed at the second stage of the analysis as explained
at para 56 above, and I address this below. But in my view the 2017 Regulations
are also relevant to the first stage. The contrast between regulation 4 of the
2017 Regulations and paragraph 55.3.1 of the EIG is striking. Paragraph 55.3.1
contains a non-exhaustive list of criteria, only some of which may be relevant
to an assessment of the risk of an applicant absconding for the purposes of
article 28(2). Regulation 4, on the other hand, says that the Secretary of
State must consider the factors which are identified and the potential
relevance of them all to such an assessment is plain.</span></a></p><a name="para64">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In summary and for the reasons I
have given, I am satisfied that Chapter 55 of the EIG does not establish
objective criteria for the assessment of whether an applicant for international
protection who is subject to a Dublin III transfer procedure may abscond; its
contents do not constitute a framework with certain predetermined limits; and
it does not set out the limits of the flexibility of the relevant authorities in
assessing the circumstances of each case in a manner which is binding and known
in advance. It follows that Chapter 55 of the EIG cannot satisfy the
requirements of articles 28(2) and 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation and the

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State contends
that the circumstances of these appeals are very different from those of <i>Al
Chodor</i>. It is argued that Chapter 55 of the EIG is not mere administrative
practice and that in reality it is prescriptive and imposes restrictions on the
executive power to detain that go beyond the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles.
Compliance with the provisions of Chapter 55 is enforceable by individuals
before the courts and an unlawful failure to comply will result in the
detention being held to be unlawful and lead to an order for the release of the
person concerned or an award of compensation, or both. It is also contended
that, in English law, settled case law defines the legal powers which limit the
statutory power to detain and permits enforcement of the criteria which
restrict the power of the executive to detain and which in other legal systems
might exist only in legislation. As such, case law and Chapter 55 EIG are
integral components of the law that governs and limits the power to detain and
together define how the power to detain must be exercised. Therefore, Chapter
55 constitutes the kind of non-legislative instrument that the CJEU
contemplated would satisfy article 28(2) and 2(n). Indeed, the submission
continues, if a non-legislative instrument like Chapter 55 does not constitute
the kind of non-legislative instrument that the CJEU contemplated would satisfy
articles 28(2) and 2(n) then it is difficult to imagine what the CJEU was
contemplating when it departed from the Advocate General’s view.</span></a></p><a name="para67">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The circumstances of the <i>Al
Chodor</i> case were plainly very different from those the subject of these
appeals. It will be recalled that Czech law conferred on the police force a
wide power to detain. Nevertheless, the national court had laid down in a
series of judgments some criteria for assessing the risk of absconding.
However, as the Advocate General explained, the presentation of these criteria
was fragmentary. In addition, there was doubt as to whether that administrative
practice had been publicised and it was alterable at will.</span></a></p><a name="para68">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There can also be no doubt that in
this jurisdiction a policy statement such as Chapter 55 of the EIG has
significant legal effects. I have referred to these at paras 50-51 above. In
broad terms and as Laws LJ explained in <i>R (Nadarajah) v Secretary of State

authority has issued a promise or adopted a practice which represents how it
proposes to act in a given area, the law requires that promise or practice to
be honoured unless there is good reason not to do so. Moreover, the court is
the final arbiter of what a policy means<i>: Kambadzi</i>, at para 36, per Lord
Hope; <i>Mandalia v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/59.html">[2015] UKSC 59</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/59.html">[2015] 1 WLR 4546</a>, para 31, per Lord Wilson of Culworth.

</span></a></span><a name="para70"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, the word “law” is used
in articles 5(1)(f), 8(2), 9(2), 10(2) and 11(2) of the ECHR which require that
any interference with the rights affirmed by these provisions be in accordance
with “a procedure prescribed by law”, “in accordance with the law” or
“prescribed by law”. The meaning of each of these expressions is the same and
the word “law” within them encompasses not only legislation but also case law.
As the ECtHR explained in <i>Sunday Times v United Kingdom </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html">(1979) 2 EHRR 245</a>, para 47, were it otherwise it would deprive a common law state which was
party to the ECHR of the protection of article 10(2) and strike at the roots of
that state’s legal system. Indeed, the applicants in that case did not argue
that the expression prescribed by law required legislation in every case; they
contended that legislation was required only where the common law rules were so
uncertain that they did not satisfy the requirement of legal certainty. The
court went on to explain, at para 49, that two of the requirements that flow
from the expression “prescribed by law” are that a law must be accessible and
sufficiently precise to enable a person adequately to foresee the consequences
of his actions and so regulate his conduct. But, the court continued, the
consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty; that was
unattainable and might carry with it excessive rigidity, preventing the law
from keeping pace with changing circumstances.</p>

by an authority for the seclusion of detained psychiatric patients. The House
of Lords held any interference with the article 8 rights of patients was
justified under article 8(2). Seclusion under the policy was necessary for,
among other things, the prevention of disorder, the protection of health and
the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and if properly used it
would not be disproportionate. The procedure adopted by the authority did not
permit arbitrary or random decision making and the rules were accessible,
foreseeable and predictable. In these circumstances, it could not be said that
they were not in accordance with or prescribed by law. Lord Bingham of
Cornhill, with whom Lord Hope and Lord Scott of Foscote agreed, rejected a submission
that the interference was not in accordance with the law because it was not
prescribed by a binding general law:</p>

I cannot for my part accept this. The requirement that any interference with
the right guaranteed by article 8(1) be in accordance with the law is important
and salutary, but it is directed to substance and not form. It is intended to
ensure that any interference is not random and arbitrary but governed by clear
pre-existing rules, and that the circumstances and procedures adopted are
predictable and foreseeable by those to whom they are applied.”</span></p>

can only amount to a “law” within the meaning of article 2(n) if it has the
necessary quality of certainty and that is something that Chapter 55 does not
have. To ignore the need for certainty would be impermissibly to remove the

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As I have explained, the Advocate
General identified the two objectives of the requirement that the criteria for
assessing the risk of absconding be defined by law as being first, to ensure
that those criteria offer sufficient guarantees in terms of legal certainty,
that is to say that the measures adopted by member states enable the
individuals concerned to ascertain the scope of their rights and obligations
and to foresee the consequences of their actions; and secondly, to ensure that
the discretion enjoyed by the individual authorities responsible for applying
those criteria is exercised within a framework of pre-determined limits. All of
this reasoning is echoed in the judgment of the CJEU, in particular at paras 41
to 43. The CJEU also explained, at para 44, that the adoption of rules of
general application would provide the necessary guarantees in so far as they
set out the limits of the flexibility of the authorities in a manner which is
binding and known in advance, and further, that the criteria are best placed
for the external direction of the discretion of those authorities for the
purpose of protecting applicants against arbitrary decision making. In this
latter connection it referred, with apparent approval, to the observations of
the Advocate General at paras 81 and 82 of his Opinion (see para 33 above).</span></a></p><a name="para73">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgement and for the
reasons I have given at paras 57-65 above, it is clear that Chapter 55 does not
satisfy these requirements. It does not set out the limits of the flexibility
of the relevant authorities in assessing the circumstances of each case in a
manner which is binding and known in advance and so lacks the necessary
qualities of certainty and predictability. Therefore, it does not constitute a
“law” for the purposes of articles 28(2) and 2(n).</span></a></p><a name="para74">

the meaning of article 2(n).</a> The Secretary of State maintains that it can
for the reasons summarised at paras 67-71 above. Reliance is also placed on the
2017 Regulations. It is said that the respondents’ argument that promulgation
of the criteria set out in the 2017 Regulations by means of a policy would not
comply with articles 2(n) and 28(2) whereas the making of secondary legislation
in the same terms would so comply, shows how technical and formal the objection

</span></a></span><a name="para76"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The respondents have advanced
powerful arguments to the contrary, however. First, it is a feature of the policy-adherence
principle that the decision maker is entitled for good reason to depart from
the policy: see, for example, <i>Lumba</i> at para 54, per Lord Dyson (with
whom Lord Hope, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Collins of Mapesbury
agreed); at para 202, per Baroness Hale of Richmond; at para 245, per Lord Kerr
of Tonaghmore; at para 351, per Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood (with whom
Lord Rodger of Earlsferry agreed); and at para 312, per Lord Phillips of Worth
Matravers. Hence, the respondents continue, a statement of policy cannot be a
principle of general application.</span></a></p><a name="para76">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The respondents’ second argument
focuses on the view expressed by the Advocate General in <i>Al Chodor</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C52815.html">[2017] 3 CMLR 24</a>, paras 81 and 82 of his Opinion that the discretion of the authorities
should be circumscribed in such a way as would best guard applicants against
arbitrary deprivations of liberty, and so the content of the criteria and their
application in a particular case should be decided by institutionally separate
authorities (see para 33 above). Further, in explaining why a provision of
general application is required, the CJEU referred to this aspect of the
Advocate General’s Opinion with apparent approval (<i>Al Chodor</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C52815.html">[2017] 4 WLR 125</a>, para 44). The respondents also point out that, under United Kingdom
constitutional arrangements, a statement of immigration policy and the common
law principle of policy-adherence do not involve external direction and that,
as a matter of constitutional theory, under the <i>Carltona</i> doctrine (<i>Carltona
Ltd v Comrs of Works</i> [1943] 2 All ER 560), the decisions of the Secretary
of State’s officials count as his. It follows, say the respondents, that a
statement of policy cannot be a binding general law.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para78"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The third argument advanced by the
respondents is directed at the reliance by the Secretary of State upon the
position under the ECHR that interferences with human rights must be
“prescribed by law”, and how this requirement has been interpreted. The
respondents contend that this reliance is misplaced because articles 28(2) and
2(n) require more than the conventional ECHR standards of prescription. They
also say, fairly in my view, that what is needed is a “<i>high level of
protection</i>” (<i>Al Chodor</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2017/C52815.html">[2017] 4 WLR 125</a>, paras 34 and 43), that
there are to be “<i>strict safeguards</i>” (<i>Al Chodor</i>, para 40), and
that there are to be “<i>greater guarantees</i>” than applied under Dublin II (<i>Al
Chodor</i>, para 35). They contend that, in giving this guidance and contrary
to the position taken by the Secretary of State, the CJEU plainly had in mind
the settled case law of common law systems and that such is apparent from its
reference (<i>Al Chodor</i>, para 21) to the decision of the ECtHR in <i>Kruslin
v France</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1990/10.html">(1990) 12 EHRR 547</a> in which that court discussed the role of case

Act. As we have seen, the power is limited in various ways. It is limited by
the <i>Hardial Singh </i>principles such that a failure by the Secretary of

too, a failure by the Secretary of State to adhere to a published policy under

submission, which the majority of the Court of Appeal accepted, is that the
exercise by the Secretary of State of the power to detain under the 1971 Act is
also constrained by any applicable obligations under European Union law by
operation of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972. The respondents
were detained pursuant to the policy in the EIG which was unlawful in so far as
it failed to give effect to articles 28(2) and 2(n) of the Dublin III
Regulation. Put another way, nothing in the 1971 Act authorised an exercise of
the power to detain in breach of European Union law. The detention of the
respondents under the 1971 Act and pursuant to the policy in the EIG was in
breach of Union law. It follows that they were detained without lawful
authority and their detention amounted to false imprisonment, and they are
entitled to damages.</span></a></p><a name="para83">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This argument is clear and, in my
opinion, compelling. However, the Secretary of State argues that it is
simplistic and that, were it to be accepted, it would ride roughshod over the
careful balance of interests that is inherent in the principles of European
Union law which govern and restrict the availability of damages as a remedy for
breach by a member state of Union law, particularly where the precise effect of
that law is unclear until it has been established by a decision of the CJEU.

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is contended first, that there
are only two ways in which a claimant in domestic proceedings is entitled to
damages payable by a member state for a breach of European Union law: either
where the law specifies the penalties to be imposed or the compensation to be
provided in the event of breach, or under the principles established by the
CJEU in <i>Francovich v Italian Republic</i> (Joined Cases C-6/90 and C-9/90) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1991/C690.html">[1995] ICR 722</a>. Here, the Secretary of State continues, the Dublin III Regulation does
not provide for compensation for its breach and so the respondents’ only

</span></a></span><a name="para86"><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Francovich</span></i><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> was a case concerning the obligation upon a member
state to take, within a given period, the measures necessary to implement a
Directive. The court explained that it is a principle of European Union law
that member states are obliged to pay compensation for harm caused to
individuals by breaches of the law for which they can be held responsible, but
that the conditions under which that liability gives rise to a right to
compensation depend upon the nature of the breach giving rise to the claim.
This issue and in particular the approach to be adopted where the legislature
of the member state has a wide discretion when acting in a field governed by
Union law, was explored further by the court in <i>Factortame</i>. The court
explained that Union law confers a right to reparation where: the rule of law
infringed is intended to confer rights on individuals; the breach of the
obligation resting on the state is sufficiently serious; and there is a direct
causal link between the breach and the damage sustained by the injured parties:
<i>Factortame</i>, para 51. The decisive test for determining whether the
breach is sufficiently serious is whether the member state manifestly and
gravely disregarded&nbsp; the limits on its discretion: <i>Factortame</i>, para 55.
The factors which the national court may take into consideration include the
clarity and precision of the rule breached; the measure of discretion left by
the rule to the national authority; whether the infringement and the damage
caused was intentional or involuntary; whether any error of law was excusable
or inexcusable; the fact that the position taken by a European Union
institution may have contributed towards the omission; and the adoption or
retention of national measures contrary to European Union law: <i>Factortame</i>,
para 56. On any view, a breach of European Union law will be sufficiently
serious if it is persisted in once it is clear that the impugned conduct
constitutes an infringement: <i>Factortame</i>, para 57.</span></a></p><a name="para86">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State has invoked
all of these principles on this appeal. It is contended that European Union law
was impenetrable before the decision of the CJEU in <i>Al Chodor</i> and that
this is highly relevant to the question whether any breach by the United
Kingdom of Union law was intentional or voluntary, or excusable or inexcusable,
and therefore sufficiently serious to trigger a liability for <i>Francovich</i>
damages. The Secretary of State also points to the wide margin of discretion
given to member states in giving effect to articles 28(2) and 2(n), and
contends that in circumstances such as those of this appeal a manifest and
grave disregard of the limits of the discretion must be established before
damages are available; and that the same criteria should inform, if not govern,
a claim for damages for false imprisonment under common law.</span></a></p><a name="para87">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There can be no dispute about the
correctness of the principles of European Union law which I have summarised in
para 86. I accept too that it is by reference to these principles that any
claim by the respondents for damages under Union law must be judged. But it
does not follow that the same principles constrain the claim by the respondents
for damages for wrongful imprisonment and in my judgement and for the reasons
which follow, they do not.</span></a></p><a name="para88">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">First, the consequence of a
failure by a member state to establish, in a binding provision of general
application, objective criteria underlying the reasons for believing that an
applicant for international protection who is subject to a Dublin III procedure
may abscond, is that article 28(2) of the Regulation does not apply. This in turn
means that the detention of such an applicant in such a state is unlawful and
he or she must be released: see <i>Al Chodor</i>, paras 17 and 46. In this
appeal, it has the consequence that the decision to detain the respondents lay
outside the boundaries of any permissible exercise of the power to detain
conferred by paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.</span></a></p><a name="para89">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Secondly and as I have explained,
the right to liberty is a fundamental human right enshrined in article 5 of the
ECHR. Immigration detention is only in accordance with article 5(1)(f) in so
far as it is in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. Moreover, a
person who is detained unlawfully must be released: article 5(4); and is
entitled to compensation: article 5(5). These principles are also general
principles of European Union law: article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union.</span></a></p><a name="para90">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Thirdly, the right to compensation
is provided in domestic law by the right at common law to claim damages for
false imprisonment. Generally, damages for false imprisonment are awarded as
compensation and so the level of damages will depend on the circumstances and
degree of harm the claimant has suffered by reason of his or her wrongful
detention. There is no reason to believe that the impact of loss of liberty is
likely to be affected by whether lack of legal authority for the detention is
the consequence of a failure to comply with European Union or domestic
legislation, and in my judgement the source of the lack of legal authority does
not justify treating those who have been wrongfully detained differently from
one another.</span></a></p><a name="para91">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second limb to the Secretary
of State’s submissions is founded on the decision of this court in <i>Lumba</i>.
It is argued that in <i>Lumba</i> this court rejected the submission that any
public law error in a decision to detain would result in the subsequent
detention being unlawful, regardless of any of the circumstances of that public
law error, and instead adopted an approach which involved the weighing of a
number of countervailing considerations, such as the nature and extent of the
public law error, the absence of procedural safeguards which are normally
available in cases of judicial review but are not available in a private law
action for damages for false imprisonment, and the discretionary nature of
judicial review remedies. We are urged to adopt the same approach in this
appeal in considering the elements of the tort of false imprisonment and
correct approach to the assessment of damages, if liability is established. It
is submitted that such an approach echoes that of the CJEU in <i>Factortame</i>
when formulating the necessary elements of a claim for damages for a breach of
European Union law.</span></a></p><a name="para92">

</span><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Lumba</span></i><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> was a case in which the Secretary of State applied an
unpublished policy of detention for all foreign national prisoners on
completion of their sentences of imprisonment and pending the making of
deportation orders against them. This court held that the unpublished policy
was unlawful because it was a blanket policy which admitted of no exceptions
and was inconsistent with the Secretary of State’s published policy. It also
held that a public law error can found a claim for damages for false
imprisonment but recognised that not all public law errors will have this
effect. The majority expressed themselves in slightly different ways. Lord
Dyson explained, at para 68, that the error must be material to the decision to
detain:</span></a></p><a name="para93">

the error must be one which is material in public law terms. It is not every
breach of public law that is sufficient to give rise to a cause of action in
false imprisonment. In the present context, the breach of public law must bear
on and be relevant to the decision to detain.”</span></p>

their heart a recognition that a public law error will not render detention
unlawful unless that error bears upon and is relevant to the decision to

There was a requirement for a binding provision of general application
containing objective criteria underlying the reasons for believing that an
applicant might abscond, and that requirement was not satisfied. This was
fundamental to the decision to detain and it can make no difference whether the
source of that requirement lay in European Union or domestic legislation.</span></a></p><a name="para98">

disproportionate. Put another way, article 28 excludes any application of the
power to detain conferred by Schedule 2 of the 1971 Act. The detention of such
a person is therefore completely covered by Union law and that person is only
entitled to damages under Union law.</span></p>

considerable extent with those I have already addressed. I of course accept
that the Dublin III Regulation does not require member states to confer a right
to damages on persons who have been detained in breach of its terms. So too I
recognise that one of the matters informing the formulation by the CJEU of the
conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to
individuals by a breach of Union law is whether the state concerned manifestly
and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion, and that one of the
factors which may be relevant to this issue is the clarity and precision of the
rule breached: <i>Factortame</i>, paras 55-56. I also accept that the domestic
tort of false imprisonment was framed without reference to the particular
problems to which the Dublin III Regulation gives rise.</span></a></p><a name="para100">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">These points aside, however, I
cannot agree with Sales LJ’s analysis. The power to detain applicants for
international protection who are subject to a Dublin III procedure is
conferred, not by the Dublin III Regulation, but by Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.
That power to detain is constrained in various ways, three of which I have
discussed: the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles, the policy-adherence principle
and the provisions of the Dublin III Regulation. Here the Secretary of State’s
published policy in Chapter 55 of the EIG did not comply with articles 28(2)
and 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation with the consequence that, in the case of
each of the respondents, the decision to detain lay outside the scope of any
legitimate exercise of the discretion conferred by Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.
In these circumstances, the two ingredients of the tort of wrongful
imprisonment were undoubtedly present. As the respondents submit and I accept,
the right under domestic law to claim damages for wrongful imprisonment is not
dependent on the law being clear. Nor is it dependent upon the nature of the
illegality, that is to say whether it is the consequence of a failure to comply
with European Union legislation, as in this case, or has some other cause, as
it did in <i>Lumba</i>.</span></a></p><a name="para101">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Further, there is no disconnection
between a failure to comply with articles 28(2) and 2(n) of Dublin III
Regulation and the tort of false imprisonment in circumstances such as those of
the cases before us. Nor can the Secretary of State derive any assistance from
the position of the third respondent. He was not detained pursuant to an order
of the court. He was simply denied bail. A decision on a bail application is
not a determination of whether or not the detention is lawful, whether at
common law or for the purposes of article 5(4) of the ECHR: see, for example, <i>Lumba</i>
at para 118.</span></a></p><a name="para102">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The approach adopted in this
jurisdiction to claims for damages for violations of article 6 of the ECHR does
not assist the Secretary of State either. Sales LJ referred to the decision of
the House of Lords in <i>R (Greenfield) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/14.html">[2005] UKHL 14</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/14.html">[2005] 1 WLR 673</a>. In that case Mr Greenfield, a
prisoner, failed a mandatory drug test and was charged with a drugs offence
under the relevant prison rules. The charge was heard by the deputy controller,
a Crown servant, for whom the Secretary of State was responsible. The deputy
controller refused a request by Mr Greenfield that he be legally represented.
The charge was proved and Mr Greenfield was ordered to serve an extra 21 days
of imprisonment. He applied for judicial review of the decision, alleging that
his rights under article 6 of the ECHR had been violated. In due course the
Secretary of State conceded there had been a breach of article 6 on the basis
that the proceedings involved a criminal charge, that the deputy controller was
not an independent tribunal and that Mr Greenfield had been denied legal
representation of his own choosing. Mr Greenfield nevertheless pursued his
claim for damages for the violations of article 6 which had taken place. The
House of Lords held that, in deciding whether an award of damages was
necessary, it was appropriate to look to the jurisprudence of the ECtHR for
guidance, and in the great majority of cases in which that court had found a
breach of article 6 it had treated the finding of violation as, in itself, just
satisfaction under article 41, and that it would only award monetary
compensation where it was satisfied that the loss or damage was caused by the
violation.</p>

between <i>Greenfield</i> and the cases before us on this appeal is that, in <i>Greenfield</i>,
the claim for damages was based entirely on the breach of article 6. There was
no claim for damages for wrongful imprisonment or for any other tort and Mr
Greenfield had not suffered any loss. Indeed, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill
explained at paras 27 to 29, the hearing had been conducted in an exemplary
manner and, while it could be accepted that Mr Greenfield thought that the
authorities were biased against prisoners and that he would not receive a fair
hearing, the manner of his adjudication had been the norm, he had been treated
no differently from any other prisoner and there was no feature of the case
which justified an award of damages.</span></a></p><a name="para104">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State contends
that the respondents should be awarded no more than nominal damages. It is said
that it is inevitable that the respondents would have been detained lawfully,
had the Secretary of State appreciated the unlawfulness of Chapter 55 of the
EIG. That is demonstrated by the 2017 Regulations, which came into force on 15
March 2017, the day the CJEU gave judgment in <i>Al Chodor</i>. Further, the
argument continues, these regulations meet all of the criteria set out in
articles 28(2) and 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU
in <i>Al Chodor</i>, and their application would have resulted in the same
outcome: the respondents would have been detained.</span></a></p><a name="para106">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State relies in
support of this contention upon the decision of this court in <i>Lumba</i>. One
of the issues in that appeal was whether the appellants had suffered any loss
as a result of their wrongful imprisonment. The majority of the court held they
had not because, had the Secretary of State acted lawfully and applied her
published policy on detention as opposed to her unpublished policy of blanket
detention, it was inevitable that the appellants would have been detained. In
other words, the detention of the appellants was at all times justifiable.</span></a></p><a name="para107">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The same point emerges from the
decision of this court in <i>Kambadzi</i>. There the claimant’s detention
pending deportation was unlawful because it had not been reviewed in accordance
with the Secretary of State’s published policy and rule 9(1) of the Detention
Centre Rules 2001 (SI 2001/238). Although it could be no defence to a claim for
false imprisonment to demonstrate that, if reviews had been carried out, the
claimant would still have been detained, this would be relevant to the claim
for damages. Lord Hope said this at para 55:</span></a></p><a name="para108">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“As
for the question of damages, the decision on this point in <i>Lumba</i> was
that the appellants were entitled to no more than nominal damages as their
detention was at all times justifiable. But this cannot be assumed to be so in
every case, and in this case the facts have still to be established. So I would
not foreclose entirely the possibility that the appellant in this case is
entitled to no more than a purely nominal award.”</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Baroness Hale of Richmond summed
up the position this way at para 74:</span></a></p><a name="para109">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“False
imprisonment is a trespass to the person and therefore actionable per se,
without proof of loss or damage. But that does not affect the principle that
the defendant is only liable to pay substantial damages for the loss and damage
which his wrongful act has caused. The amount of compensation to which a person
is entitled must be affected by whether he would have suffered the loss and
damage had things been done as they should have been done.”</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Similarly, Lord Kerr said this at
para 89:</span></a></p><a name="para110">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“As
the majority in <i>Lumba</i> also held, however, causation is relevant to the
question of the recoverability of damages. … I consider that if it can be shown
that the claimant would not have been released if a proper review had been
carried out, this must have an impact on the quantum of compensation and that
nominal damages only will be recoverable.”</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">These principles were subsequently
applied by the Court of Appeal in <i>Parker v Chief Constable of Essex Police</i>
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2788.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 2788</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2788.html">[2019] 1 WLR 2238</a>, another decision on which the Secretary
of State relies. Here the claimant was arrested on suspicion of murder and
rape. The investigating officer was delayed by traffic so the arrest was
carried out by a surveillance officer who was present at the scene but did not
personally have reasonable grounds for suspecting the claimant was guilty of an
offence, as required by section 24(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. It was perfectly clear that, had this requirement been appreciated, it
could and would have been met, either by waiting for the investigating officer
to arrive or by properly briefing the officer who carried out the arrest.
Accordingly, the claimant could only recover nominal damages.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para112"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my view the Secretary of State
is seeking to apply these principles well beyond their proper limits. In <i>Lumba</i>,
this court considered what would have happened had the Secretary of State
applied his published policy. In <i>Kambadzi</i>, the question was whether the
claimant would have been detained had regular reviews been carried out. In <i>Parker</i>,
it was established that, had things been done as they should have been, the
claimant could and would have been arrested lawfully. In other words, a
claimant will be awarded nominal damages if it is established that the
detention could have been effected lawfully under the existing legal and policy
framework. Article 5(1) of the ECHR requires any deprivation of liberty to have
a legal basis in domestic law, and that law must be sufficiently precise and
accessible in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness: see <i>Dougoz v Greece</i>
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/213.html">(2002) 34 EHRR 61</a>, para 55. Similarly, a person is entitled to know what the
law and any policy made under it is, so he or she can make relevant
representations in relation to it: see <i>Lumba</i>, at paras 34-36, per Lord
Dyson. It can be no answer to a claim for damages for unlawful imprisonment
that the detention would have been lawful had the law been different.</p>
