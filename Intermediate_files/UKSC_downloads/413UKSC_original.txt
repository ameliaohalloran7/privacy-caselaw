<p class="NewSpeech">LORD CLARKE:</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is concerned with the law of unjust enrichment and
subrogation. The original parties to the action were Melissa Menelaou as
claimant (“Melissa”), the Bank of Cyprus UK Ltd as defendant (“the Bank”) and a
firm of solicitors, Boulter &amp; Co, as third party (“Boulters”). The trial of
the action came before David Donaldson QC, sitting as an additional judge of
the Chancery Division (“the judge”): </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/1991.html">[2012] EWHC 1991 (Ch)</a>. The trial began on
16 May 2012 and lasted three days. By the end of the trial only the Bank’s
counterclaim against Melissa was live. On 19 July 2012 the judge handed down a
judgment dismissing the counterclaim. The Bank appealed to the Court of Appeal
(Moses, Tomlinson and Floyd LJJ), which allowed the appeal on 4 July 2013:
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1960</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2014] 1 WLR 854</a>. Melissa appeals to this court.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The background facts</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts can largely be taken from the agreed statement of facts and
issues. Melissa, who was born on 27 January 1990, is the second of the four
children of Mr Parris and Mrs Donna Menelaou (“the Menelaou parents”). The
other children were Danielle, born on 9 August 1986, Max, born on 24 June 1991
and Ella-Mae, born on 6 February 2002. In mid-2008, the Menelaou parents and
their three youngest children lived at Rush Green Hall, Great Amwell,
Hertfordshire (“Rush Green Hall”), which was a property owned by the Menelaou
parents jointly. Melissa was 18 and a student at a nearby college. Rush Green
Hall was subject to two charges in favour of the Bank. The Menelaou parents
directly owed the Bank about £2.2m, and had personally guaranteed loans made by
the Bank to their companies.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Menelaou parents decided to sell Rush Green Hall, to apply some of
the proceeds to buy a smaller property as the family home, to provide funds for
Danielle to pay the deposit on a house which she wanted to buy with her future
husband and to free up capital to invest in a further development project. The
Menelaou parents instructed Boulters to act for them in the conveyancing
transaction. The senior partner of Boulters was Mr Menelaou’s sister. They used
Mr Paul Cacciatore, who was employed by Boulters as a legal executive and who
was also one of Mr Menelaou’s brothers-in-law. On 15 July 2008 contracts were
exchanged for the sale of Rush Green Hall for the price of £1.9m. The
contractual purchasers of Rush Green Hall paid a deposit of £190,000 to Boulters
for the account of the Menelaou parents.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>About a week later, Mr Menelaou informed Mr Cacciatore that he had found
a new property to serve as the family home at 2 Great Oak Court, Hunsdon,
Hertfordshire (“Great Oak Court”). On 24 July 2008 contracts were exchanged for
the purchase of Great Oak Court for the price of £875,000. On Mr Menelaou’s
instructions, the purchaser of Great Oak Court was to be Melissa. The deposit
payable was £87,500. This deposit was paid from the £190,000 held by Boulters
as the deposit for the sale of Rush Green Hall. Mr Menelaou told Melissa that
Great Oak Court was being bought in her name as a gift to her, on the basis
that she would hold the property for the benefit of herself and her two younger
siblings. She agreed to the arrangement.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Bank was not approached about the proposed arrangement prior to the
exchanges of contracts. The Bank sanctioned the proposed arrangements with some
reluctance given the overall indebtedness of the Menelaou parents and their
companies. On 5 September 2008 Boulters wrote to the Bank saying that it
understood that the Bank was to take a charge over Great Oak Court from Melissa,
which Boulters understood would be a third party charge. Completion was to be
on 12 September. On 9 September 2008 the Bank wrote to Boulters in these terms:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Thank you for your letter dated 5
September 2008. We confirm that upon receipt of £750,000 we will release our
charges over [Rush Green Hall] subject to a third party legal charge over [Great
Oak Court] which is registered in the name of Melissa Menelaou.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-2.9pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm">Melissa was not aware of the Bank’s intention to take any
charge over Great Oak Court.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Bank also instructed Boulters to act as its solicitors to deal with
the discharge of its charges over Rush Green Hall and to obtain a charge in
favour of the Bank over Great Oak Court. On 10 September 2008 Boulters replied
to the Bank’s letter of 9 September enclosing a certificate of title
undertaking to obtain an executed mortgage in Melissa’s name over Great Oak
Court and to confirm that they had complied or would comply with the Bank’s
instructions. On 11 September 2008 Boulters sent the Bank a form of legal
charge over Great Oak Court, purportedly signed by Melissa and identifying her
as “the customer”. It was (and is) Melissa’s case, supported by her brother and
by handwriting evidence, that the signature on the charge was not hers. Indeed,
she was unaware of the existence of the charge until 2010. On the same day, 11
September 2008, the Bank telephoned Boulters and pointed out that the identity
of the customer in the charge should be the Menelaou parents and not Melissa.
Boulters did not contact Melissa. Instead, an employee of Boulters simply
changed the name of the customer in manuscript on the charge from that of
Melissa to those of the Menelaou parents.</a></p><a name="para6">

Menelaou parents and the purchase of Great Oak Court by Melissa both took
place. As part of the completion process, Boulters received the balance of the
price of Rush Green Hall from its purchasers. They remitted £750,000 to the
Bank and sent a further £785,000 to the vendors of Great Oak Court to meet the
remaining 90% of the purchase price for Great Oak Court. Boulters also sent the
Bank two deeds to be sealed by the Bank authorising the cancellation of the
entries in respect of the two registered charges over Rush Green Hall. The
discharge of mortgage forms were not returned by the Bank until 13 October
2008. After a considerable delay, Melissa was registered as the proprietor of
Great Oak Court. The Bank was also registered as the purported chargee. Following
completion, the Menelaou parents, Melissa, and her two younger siblings moved
into Great Oak Court and occupied it as their family home.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>In the spring of 2010 Melissa was told by her parents that their
business was experiencing difficulties. It was proposed that Great Oak Court
would be sold and a smaller property purchased. It was at this point that
Melissa discovered the existence of the charge dated 12 September 2008 over
Great Oak Court. Melissa’s conveyancing solicitors then corresponded with
Boulters. The Bank was made aware of the challenge to the validity of its
charge and, through its solicitors, intimated a claim against Boulters. Many
allegations of breach of duty (fiduciary and otherwise) were made by the Bank against
Boulters.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>On 2 November 2010 Melissa issued a Part 7 claim in the Chancery
Division seeking orders that all references to the charge, as appearing in the
Charges Register for Great Oak Court, be removed. The main basis for this claim
was that, not having been signed by Melissa, the Bank’s charge was void. The
Bank defended the claim but also counterclaimed for a declaration that the Bank
was entitled to be subrogated to an unpaid vendor’s lien over Great Oak Court.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 14 January 2011 the Bank issued a Part 20 claim against Boulters for
damages for breach of trust and/or fiduciary duty, and an indemnity against all
costs and expenses that it might incur in the main claim. After the exchange of
witness statements, it became clear to Melissa and her advisers that Boulters
had altered the charge without consulting her. By consent of the parties,
pursuant to Melissa’s application dated 13 April 2012, the particulars of claim
were amended to rely upon this alteration as a further ground for rendering the
charge void. The Bank’s response was to continue to challenge the invalidity of
the charge.</a></p><a name="para10">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As stated above, the trial of the case began on 16 May 2012. At the
commencement of the trial all issues were live. Melissa was called to give evidence
and was duly cross-examined. Thereafter, following an interchange between
counsel and the judge, Boulters conceded in the Part 20 claim that the charge
was void and that Melissa was entitled to the relief sought in her claim and,
as it is put in the statement of facts and issues, reflexively, the Bank conceded
the same in the main claim. The issue of liability in the Bank’s claims against
Boulters was then compromised and a written agreement was entered into between
the Bank and Boulters whereby Boulters accepted that it was in breach of its
duties in both contract and tort and was liable to indemnify the Bank for its
losses as a result of an invalid charge being entered against Great Oak Court. As
a result of that agreement, the only remaining live issue for determination at the
trial was the Bank’s counterclaim against Melissa.</a></p><a name="para11">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judgment was reserved and (as stated above) was handed down on 19 July
2012 dismissing the counterclaim. No formal order was made on that day but a
further hearing took place on 23 October 2012, when the judge made an order
that the Bank’s charge be removed from the Register (reflecting the Bank’s and
Boulters’ concession that the Bank’s charge was void) and formally dismissed
the Bank’s counterclaim with costs. The judge granted the Bank permission to
appeal against the dismissal of its counterclaim.</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="ParaHeading">The judgment</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge made these findings in the course of his judgment. Whether by
operation of law or as a result of any agreement or understanding between the
parties, there was nothing to qualify the straightforward position that, in
receiving the sale proceeds of Rush Green Hall, Boulters was acting as agent
for Mr and Mrs Menelaou and held all the moneys for them alone (para 17). As
regards the totality of the purchase price of Great Oak Court, it was not
discharged by the use of moneys belonging to the Bank (para 19).</a></p><a name="para13">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge approached the matter on two bases, which he described as the narrow
or traditional approach to the doctrine of subrogation to the unpaid vendor’s
lien and the wider approach based on the law of unjust enrichment (para 14). He
held that the fact that the moneys provided for the purchase were not paid by,
and did not belong to, the Bank was fatal to the counterclaim on the narrow or
traditional approach (para 19). As to the wider approach,<i> </i>he concluded
that there was both benefit to Melissa, namely the gratuitous acquisition of
Great Oak Court (albeit to be held on trust for her two younger siblings), and
detriment to the Bank, namely the release of its two charges (para 22). He held
that “The existence of both detriment and benefit does not however establish
the further element that the latter should have been <i>at the expense of the
Bank</i> (para 22 - original emphasis)”.</a></p><a name="para14">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He added, also in para 22:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is sufficient for me to say
that there must in my view be something in the nature of, to use the formula
proposed in <i>Burrows, </i>The Law of Restitution, 3rd ed (2010) p 66, a
transfer of value from the Bank to the claimant. But here the claimant’s
benefit enured and was complete on 12 September 2008, while the Bank’s
detriment through the mistaken release of its charges over Rush Green Hall
occurred a month later. Whether or not time’s arrow must always and with full
rigour be respected in the law of unjust enrichment, I am clear that this is
not a case in which economic or any other kind of reality calls for its
wholesale rejection.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge concluded that, although this left Melissa without any charge
over her property, it did not leave the Bank without all recourse. This was
because the Bank had an indemnity for its losses from Boulters (in reality with
that firm’s indemnity insurers), which indemnity was agreed during the course
of the trial (para 11).</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>In a judgment handed down on 2 July 2013 the Court of Appeal unanimously
allowed the Bank’s appeal. The question in this appeal is whether it was
correct to do so. I will consider its reasoning in the course of my discussion
of the issues argued before us. On 4 July 2003 the Court of Appeal handed down
a further judgment dealing with a number of consequential issues. It d<span style="font-size:12.5pt">eclared that the Bank was entitled to be subrogated to
an equitable charge by way of an unpaid vendor’s lien over Great Oak Court </span>for
£875,000 plus interest. The result of the Court of Appeal’s decision is that
Melissa’s property, Great Oak Court, has been subjected to an equitable charge
for £875,000 plus interest. The Bank’s application to a Master in the Chancery
Division seeking to enforce the equitable charge has been stayed by agreement
pending the outcome of this appeal.</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the course of the argument, there was much discussion of the relevant
legal principles. However, in my opinion it is not necessary to resolve all the
possible issues which were discussed. It appears to me that this is a case of
unjust enrichment. In <i>Benedetti v Sawiris</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/50.html">[2013] UKSC 50</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/50.html">[2014] AC 938</a>
the Supreme Court recognised that it is now well established that the court
must ask itself four questions when faced with a claim for unjust enrichment.
They are these: (1) Has the defendant been enriched? (2) Was the enrichment at
the claimant’s expense? (3) Was the enrichment unjust? (4) Are there any
defences available to the defendant? See, for example, <i>Benedetti </i>at para
10, following <i>Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/7.html">[1999] 1 AC 221</a> per Lord Steyn at 227 (and per Lord Hoffmann to much the same effect
at 234) and <i>Investment Trust Companies v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i>[2012]
EWCH 458 (Ch), <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/458.html">[2012] STC 1150</a> per Henderson J at para 38 (<i>ITC</i>).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that paragraph Henderson J noted that Professor Andrew Burrows QC
said in <i>The Law of Restitution</i>,<i> </i>3rd ed (2011) p 27 that, if the
first three questions are answered affirmatively and the fourth negatively, the
claimant will be entitled to restitution and that those four elements
“constitute the fundamental conceptual structure of an unjust enrichment
claim”. In para 39, Henderson J accepted that approach, although he said that
the four questions were no more than broad headings for ease of exposition,
that they did not have statutory force and that there may be a considerable
degree of overlap between the first three questions. I agree.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, there is no doubt that Melissa was enriched when
she became the owner of Great Oak Court, which she was given by her parents,
albeit on the basis that she would hold it for the benefit of herself and her
two younger siblings. As it is correctly put on behalf of the Bank, her
obligation to pay the purchase price of Great Oak Court to the vendor was
discharged. The essential question is whether she was enriched at the expense
of the Bank, since, if she was, there cannot in my opinion have been any doubt
that the enrichment was unjust.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accept the submission made on behalf of the Bank that the unjust
factor or ground for restitution is usually identified in subrogation cases as
being, either (1) that the lender was acting pursuant to the mistaken
assumption that it would obtain security which it failed to obtain: see eg <i>Banque
Financière </i>per Lord Hoffmann at p 234H, or (2) failure of consideration: see
the fourth and fifth points made by Neuberger LJ in <i>Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester plc v Appleyard </i>(“<i>C&amp;G”</i>) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/291.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 291</a>, paras 35

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the facts here the Bank expected to have a first legal charge over
Great Oak Court securing the debts of the appellant’s parents and their companies
but, as events turned out, it did not have that security interest. The critical
question is therefore whether Melissa was enriched at the expense of the Bank.</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="ParaHeading">Was Melissa enriched at the expense of the Bank?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>According to Goff &amp; Jones on <i>The Law of Unjust Enrichment</i>,<i>
</i>8th ed (2011), para 6-01, the requirement that the unjust enrichment of the
defendant must have been at the expense of the claimant “reflects the principle
that the law of unjust enrichment is not concerned with the disgorgement of
gains made by defendants, nor with the compensation of losses sustained by
claimants, but with the reversal of transfers of value between claimants and
defendants”. I agree.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion the answer to the question whether Melissa was unjustly
enriched at the expense of the Bank is plainly yes. The Bank was central to the
scheme from start to finish. It had two charges on Rush Green Hall which
secured indebtedness of about £2.2m. It agreed to release £785,000 for the
purchase of Great Oak Court in return for a charge on Great Oak Court. It was
thus thanks to the Bank that Melissa became owner of Great Oak Court, but only
subject to the charge. Unfortunately the charge was void for the reasons set
out above. In the result Melissa became the owner of Great Oak Court
unencumbered by the charge. She was therefore enriched at the expense of the
Bank because the value of the property to Melissa was considerably greater than
it would have been but for the avoidance of the charge and the Bank was left
without the security which was central to the whole arrangement.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I see it, the two arrangements, namely the sale of Rush Green Hall
and the purchase of Great Oak Court, were not separate but part of one scheme,
which involved the Bank throughout. I respectfully disagree with the
conclusions of the judge summarised in paras 13 to 16 above.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not, so far as I am aware, in dispute that, if the Bank had
received all the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall and had then re-advanced
the moneys required for the purchase of Great Oak Court, it would be entitled
to succeed whether or not the re-advance was to the Menelaou parents or to
Melissa. It is submitted on behalf of the Bank that, if that is so, it would be
pure formalism for subrogation to be precluded simply because the moneys
remained in Boulters’ client account (and were not paid to the respondent)
between the sale of Rush Green Hall and the purchase of Great Oak Court; just
as Lord Steyn commented in <i>Banque Financière </i>at p 227C that it would be
“pure formalism” for the interposition of Mr Herzig between the loan by BFC of
its advance and Parc’s obligation to repay to be treated as altering the
substance of the transaction and the result of the claim. On the facts of the
instant case the funds remained in Boulters’ client account and were not paid
to the Bank because of a pre-acquisition agreement between it and the Menelaou
parents. By this agreement it was agreed that money to which the Bank was
otherwise absolutely entitled under its charges could remain advanced to the Menelaou
parents for the purpose of purchasing Great Oak Court and was to be released only
on condition that the Bank was given a specific charge over Great Oak Court.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accept those submissions, which support the conclusion in para
24 above. I would reject the submission that there must be a direct payment by
the Bank to Melissa. Such a requirement, while sufficient, is not in my view
necessary because it would be too rigid. As I see it, whether a particular
enrichment is at the expense of the claimant depends upon the facts of the
case. The question in each case is whether there is a sufficient causal
connection, in the sense of a sufficient nexus or link, between the loss to the
Bank and the benefit received by the defendant, here Melissa.</a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There has been much debate both among academics and judges as to the
correct test. The contrast was noted by Henderson J at first instance in <i>ITC</i>.
He discussed the problem in considerable detail between paras 47 and 73,
especially between paras 52 and 73. The contrast is between a rule that
requires there to be a direct causal link between the claimant’s payment and
the defendant’s enrichment, subject to some exceptions (paras 52-59) and a
broader more flexible approach (paras 60-69). He expressed his conclusions on
the principles as follows in para 67:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must now draw the
threads together, and state my conclusions on this difficult question. In the
first place, I agree with Mr Rabinowitz that there can be no room for a bright
line requirement which would automatically rule out all restitutionary claims
against indirect recipients. Indeed, Mr Swift accepted as much in his closing
submissions. In my judgment the infinite variety of possible factual
circumstances is such that an absolute rule of this nature would be
unsustainable. Secondly, however, the limited guidance to be found in the English
authorities, and above all the clear statements by all three members of the
Court of Appeal in <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council </i>[1996]
4 All ER 733, [1997] QB 380, suggest to me that it is preferable to think in
terms of a general requirement of direct enrichment, to which there are limited
exceptions, rather than to adopt Professor Birks’ view that the rule and the exceptions
should in effect swap places (see <i>‘At</i> <i>the expense of the claimant’:
direct and indirect enrichment in English law </i>in<i> Unjustified Enrichment:
Key Issues in Comparative Perspective, </i>edited by David Johnston and
Reinhard Zimmermann, Cambridge (2002), p 494). In my judgment the obiter dicta
of May LJ in <i>Filby </i>and the line of subrogation cases relied on by
Professor Birks, provide too flimsy a foundation for such a reformulation,
whatever its theoretical attractions may be, quite apart from the difficulty in
framing the general rule in acceptable terms if it is <i>not</i> confined to
direct recipients.”</p>

</span>Henderson J continued as follows in para 68.</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The real question, therefore, is
whether claims of the present type should be treated as exceptions to the
general rule. So far as I am aware, no exhaustive list of criteria for the
recognition of exceptions has yet been put forward by proponents of the general
rule, and I think it is safe to assume that the usual preference of English law
for development in a pragmatic and step-by-step fashion will prevail.
Nevertheless, in the search for principle a number of relevant considerations
have been identified, including (in no particular order):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a) the need for a close causal
connection between the payment by the claimant and the enrichment of the
indirect recipient;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b) the need to avoid any risk of
double recovery, often coupled with a suggested requirement that the claimant
should first be required to exhaust his remedies against the direct recipient;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c) the need to avoid any conflict
with contracts between the parties, and in particular to prevent ‘leapfrogging’
over an immediate contractual counterparty in a way which would undermine the
contract; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(d) the need to confine the
remedy to disgorgement of undue enrichment, and not to allow it to encroach
into the territory of compensation or damages.”</p>

</span>It is submitted on behalf of the Bank that on four occasions since the
decision in <i>ITC </i>the Court of Appeal has endorsed the considerations
identified by Henderson J. They variously described his approach thus: as
“relevant considerations” in <i>TFL Management Services v Lloyd’s TSB Bank plc </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1415.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2006</a> (“<i>TFL”</i>) per Floyd LJ, para 57, as “of assistance” in <i>Relfo

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, in his judgment in this case Floyd LJ described Henderson J’s
approach as “thoughtful and valuable” at para 39 and in <i>TFL </i>he said this
about Henderson J’s para 68:</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“57. I agree with Henderson J that
these are relevant considerations in deciding the question of whether an
indirect benefit was conferred at the claimant’s expense. But the various
factors to which he refers are not, and were not I think intended to be, rigid
principles. Far less can it be said that if one or more of the factors can be
said to be adverse to the claim, the claim is necessarily doomed to failure.”</p>

approach of the Court of Appeal in <i>ITC</i>, where Patten LJ said at the end

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We consider that the correlative
of taking a broad approach to the first consideration by taking account of
‘economic’ or ‘commercial’ reality is that it is important not to take a narrow
view of what, under the third criterion, would conflict with contracts between
the parties or with a relevant third party in a way which would undermine the
contract.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That seems to me to be a sensible approach.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is scope for legitimate debate as to whether the correct approach
is to adopt a narrow test with exceptions or a broader approach. However, it
appears to me that, whichever test is adopted the result is likely to be the
same. In any event it is not to my mind necessary to consider the issue further
in this case because, as the Court of Appeal made clear, the position is clear
on the facts of the instant case, which is concerned only with the first of
Henderson J’s relevant considerations. In a case in which more such
considerations were relevant, it would be necessary to have regard to a number
of different factors, probably with no presumption one way or the other where
the starting point is.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In short, I agree with the approach of the Court of Appeal. In
particular, the position is neatly described by Tomlinson LJ as follows in
paras 57 and 58:</a></p><a name="para33">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, the
Bank was to receive £1.9m upon the sale of Rush Green Hall in circumstances
where it was owed £2.2m and had charges over Rush Green Hall to secure that
indebtedness. The Bank had agreed that it would release its charges over Rush
Green Hall upon receipt of £750,000 out of the sale proceeds, in return for a
charge over Great Oak Court to secure what would be the remaining indebtedness,
£1.45m, thereby enabling the Menelaou parents on the strength of that
undertaking by the Bank to use £875,000 out of the sale proceeds of Rush Green
Hall for the purchase of Great Oak Court in the name of Melissa. I do not see
how this can sensibly be described as anything other than a transfer of value
between the Bank and Melissa, in whose name the purchase of Great Oak Court was
made.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to be able to
reach this conclusion. It gives effect to the reality of the transaction,
whereas the conclusion of the judge, in my respectful view, amounts to that
pure formalism which Lord Steyn has in this context deprecated …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That was of course a reference to the speech of Lord Steyn in<i> </i><i>Banque
Financièr</i><i>e </i>referred to in para 18 above. Both Floyd and Moses LJJ
expressed much the same conclusions at paras 42 and 48 and 61-62 respectively.
I am unable to accept that there is any significance in the point which
attracted the judge (para 22) that the benefit to Melissa was complete on 12
September, whereas the detriment to the Bank occurred over a month later when
its charges over Rush Green Hall were released. As Moses LJ put it at para 62,
everyone knew, as a result of the <span style="font-size:12.5pt">Bank’s
agreement on 9 September 2008, that the Bank’s security in Rush Green Hall
would be released and, provided that the terms of that agreement were
satisfied, the Bank was bound to release its charge.</span></a></p><a name="para34">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For all these reasons I agree with the Court of Appeal that Melissa was
enriched at the expense of the Bank. I have already expressed my view that she
was unjustly so enriched.</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="ParaHeading">Defences</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fourth question, namely whether there are any defences available to
the defendant, must in my opinion be answered in the negative. On the
assumption that the first three questions are answered in the affirmative, I do
not understand Melissa to be relying upon any other defence. It is not
suggested, for example, that she had a change of position defence. Nor was she
a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. She was a mere donee and, as
such can be in no better position than her parents as donors. As indicated at
the end of para 31 above, I recognise that in another case there may well be
defences or at least countervailing considerations, as indicated, for example,
in considerations (b), (c) and (d) identified by Henderson J.</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="ParaHeading">Remedies</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next question is what remedies are available to the Bank. The answer
is that the Bank is subrogated to the unpaid seller’s lien. Subrogation
(sometimes known in this context as restitutionary subrogation) is available as
a remedy in order to reverse what would otherwise be Melissa’s unjust
enrichment. It is important to recognise that a claim in unjust enrichment is
different in principle from a claim to vindicate property rights; see eg <i>Foskett
v McKeown </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/29.html">[2001] 1 AC 102</a> per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 108F, Lord Millett
at p 129E-F and Lord Hoffmann at p 115F, where he agreed with Lord Millett.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Foskett </i>was a claim to enforce property rights. Lord Millett
expressed the distinction between that case and a case of unjust enrichment at p
129F:</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A plaintiff who brings an action
in unjust enrichment must show that the defendant has been enriched at the
plaintiff’s expense, for he cannot have been unjustly enriched if he has not
been enriched at all. <i>But the plaintiff is not concerned to show that the
defendant is in receipt of property belonging beneficially to the plaintiff or
its traceable proceeds.</i> The fact that the beneficial ownership of the
property has passed to the defendant provides no defence; indeed, it is usually
the very fact which founds the claim. Conversely, a plaintiff who brings an
action like the present must show that the defendant is in receipt of property
which belongs beneficially to him or its traceable proceeds, but he need not
show that the defendant has been enriched by its receipt. He may, for example,
have paid full value for the property, but he is still required to disgorge it
if he received it with notice of the plaintiff’s interest.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The sentence which I have put in italics shows that a
claim in unjust enrichment does not need to show a property right.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>C&amp;G</i> Neuberger LJ (giving the judgment of the Court of
Appeal) summarised the principles relevant to different types of subrogation
concisely in paras 24-49. Like Floyd LJ at para 44, he set out the principles
relevant here at para 25 as follows:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principle upon which C&amp;G
rely has been nowhere better stated than by Walton J in <i>Burston Finance Ltd
v Speirway Ltd (in liquidation) </i>[1974] 1 WLR 1648 at p 1652B-C:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">[W]here A’s money is used to pay
off the claim of B, who is a secured creditor, A is entitled to be regarded in
equity as having had an assignment to him of B’s rights as a secured creditor.
It finds one of its chief uses in the situation where one person advances money
on the understanding that he is to have certain security for the money he has advanced,
and for one reason or another, he does not receive the promised security. In
such a case he is nevertheless to be subrogated to the rights of any other
person who at the relevant time had any security over the same property and
whose debts have been discharged in whole or in part by the money so provided
by him.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Neuberger LJ noted at para 26 that that formulation was
cited with approval by (among others) Lord Hutton in <i>Banque Financière </i>at
p 245C-D.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He further noted at para 36 that in <i>Banque Financière </i>the lender
bargained for what Lord Hoffmann called at p 229C “a negative form of
protection in the form of an undertaking”, which he did not get. He added that
this did not prevent his claim to be subrogated to a security, albeit
essentially as a personal remedy: see per Lord Steyn at p 228C-D and Lord
Hoffmann at p 229C.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The class of subrogation under discussion in this case is known as
subrogation to an unpaid vendor’s lien. I agree with Floyd LJ at para 15 that
it is not a concept which it is particularly straightforward to understand. He
puts it thus. What the Bank seeks to achieve is to be placed in a position
equivalent to that of the vendor of Great Oak Court at the point where the
purchase money has not been paid. At that point the vendor would be able to
refuse to convey the title to Great Oak Court, unless the purchase money was
paid to him. He added that the lien was explained by Millett LJ in <i>Barclays
Bank plc v Estates &amp; Commercial Ltd</i> [1977] 1 WLR 415 at pp 419-420, in
this way (omitting citations):</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As soon as a binding contract for
sale [of land] is entered into, the vendor has a lien on the property for the
purchase money and a right to remain in possession of the property until
payment is made. The lien does not arise on completion but on exchange of
contracts. It is discharged on completion to the extent that the purchase money
is paid. … Even if the vendor executes an outright conveyance of the legal
estate in favour of the purchaser and delivers the title deeds to him, he still
retains an equitable lien on the property to secure the payment of any part of
the purchase money which remains unpaid. The lien is not excluded by the fact that
the conveyance contains an express receipt for the purchase money.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The lien arises by operation of
law and independently of the agreement between the parties. It does not depend
in any way upon the parties’ subjective intentions. It is excluded where its
retention would be inconsistent with the provisions of the contract for sale or
with the true nature of the transaction as disclosed by the documents.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd LJ then set out the passage from the judgment of Walton J in <i>Burston
Finance</i> set out by Neuberger LJ in <i>C&amp;G </i>and quoted at para 39
above. I adopt Floyd LJ’s description of the position at para 17 of his
judgment as follows. A<span style="font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">
</span>third party who provides some or all of the purchase money for a
purchaser, thereby discharging the obligation to the vendor, can claim the
benefit of the unpaid vendor’s lien by subrogation. This is so even after the
lien has been extinguished as between vendor and purchaser. Floyd LJ notes that
it is not intuitively clear how, or why, this should be the case and asks how
it is that the unpaid vendor’s lien transferred from the vendor to the third
party. He says with force that it might be thought that once the obligation in
question has been extinguished, there is nothing which the vendor could
transfer. He further asks by what legal method the transfer takes place, even
if there was something to transfer. He notes that there has been no legal
assignment and suggests that it was conceptual problems such as these that gave
rise to the notion that the vendor’s lien was “kept alive” for the benefit of
the subrogated third party.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd LJ resolves this apparent difficulty by adding that in <i>Banque
Financière </i>at p 236 Lord Hoffmann explained that the phrase “keeping the
charge alive” was not a literal truth but a metaphor or analogy:</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In<span style="font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:HiddenHorzOCR"> </span>a case in which the whole of the secured
debt is repaid, the charge is not kept alive at all. It is discharged and
ceases to exist.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hoffmann added at p 236E-F:</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para43">“It is important to remember that,
as Millett LJ pointed out in <i>Boscawen v Bajwa </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a>, 335,
subrogation is not a right or a cause of action but an equitable remedy against
a party who would otherwise be unjustly enriched. It is a means by which the
court regulates the legal relationships between a plaintiff and a defendant or
defendants in order to prevent unjust enrichment. When judges say the charge is
‘kept alive’ for the benefit of the plaintiff, what they mean is that his legal
relations with a defendant who would otherwise be unjustly enriched are regulated
<i>as if </i>the benefit of the charge had been assigned to him.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 19 Floyd LJ notes that Lord Hoffmann reviewed five authorities,
namely <i>Chetwynd v Allen </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1898/180.html">[1899] 1 Ch 353</a>, <i>Butler v Rice </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1910/74.html">[1910] 2 Ch 277</a>, <i>Ghana Commercial Bank v Chandiram </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1960/1960_20.html">[1960] AC 732</a>, <i>Paul v

done so, Lord Hoffmann noted at p 233 that in <i>Boscawen </i>there was no
common intention that the vendor, whose mortgage had been paid off, should
grant any security to Abbey National.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann then said this at pp 233H-234D:</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As Millett LJ pointed out, at p
339 [of <i>Boscawen</i>], the Abbey National expected to obtain a charge from
the purchaser as legal owner after completion of the sale, and, in the event
which happened of there being no such completion, did not intend its money to
be used at all. This meant that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘The factual context in which the
claim to subrogation arises is a novel one which does not appear to have arisen
before but the justice of its claim cannot be denied.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">These cases seem to me to show
that it is a mistake to regard the availability of subrogation as a remedy to
prevent unjust enrichment as turning entirely upon the question of intention,
whether common or unilateral. Such an analysis has inevitably to be propped up
by presumptions which can verge upon outright fictions, more appropriate to a
less developed legal system than we now have. I would venture to suggest that
the reason why intention has played so prominent a part in the earlier cases is
because of the influence of cases on contractual subrogation. But I think it
should be recognised that one is here concerned with a restitutionary remedy
and that the appropriate questions are therefore, first, whether the defendant
would be enriched at the plaintiff’s expense; secondly, whether such enrichment
would be unjust; and thirdly, whether there are nevertheless reasons of policy
for denying a remedy. An example of a case which failed on the third ground is <i>Orakpo
v Manson Investments Ltd </i>[1978] AC 95, in which it was considered that
restitution would be contrary to the terms and policy of the Moneylenders
Acts.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That appears to me to be an illuminating passage. Lord Hoffmann stresses
what are the same questions as those referred to in para 18 above. Moreover,
the reference to <i>Orakpo </i>seems to me to be of some significance. It
demonstrates that, when Lord Hoffmann was referring to “subrogation as a remedy
to prevent unjust enrichment”, he was not referring to subrogation to personal
rights alone because <i>Orakpo </i>was a case concerning subrogation to
property rights.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case of <i>Orakpo </i>is also of interest because it shows the broad
nature of the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Three examples suffice. Lord
Diplock said at p 104E-F:</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“My Lords, there is no general
doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law. What it does is to
provide specific remedies in particular cases of what might be classified as
unjust enrichment in a legal system that is based upon the civil law. There are
some circumstances in which the remedy takes the form of ‘subrogation’, but
this expression embraces more than a single concept in English law. It is a
convenient way of describing a transfer of rights from one person to another,
without assignment or assent of the person from whom the rights are transferred
and which takes place by operation of law in a whole variety of widely
different circumstances. Some rights by subrogation are contractual in their
origin, as in the case of contracts of insurance. Others, such as the right of
an innocent lender to recover from a company moneys borrowed ultra vires to the
extent that these have been expended on discharging the company’s lawful debts,
are in no way based on contract and appear to defeat classification except as
an empirical remedy to prevent a particular kind of unjust enrichment.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Salmon said this at p 110:</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The test as to whether the courts
will apply the doctrine of subrogation to the facts of any particular case is
entirely empirical. It is, I think, impossible to formulate any narrower
principle than that the doctrine will be applied only when the courts are
satisfied that reason and justice demand that it should be.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Finally, Lord Edmund-Davies said at p 112:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Apart from specific agreement and
certain well-established cases, it is conjectural how far the right of
subrogation will be granted though in principle there is no reason why it
should be confined to the hitherto recognised categories (<i>Goff and Jones,</i>
<i>The Law of Restitution</i> (1966), pp 376-377).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Those statements seem to me to support a flexible approach to the
remedies appropriate in a particular case. Indeed, the principles have been
extended since the decision in <i>Orakpo </i>because there is now a general
doctrine of unjust enrichment in a way that there was not when Lord Diplock
drafted his speech. Lord Hoffmann stresses the importance of the questions
identified in para 18 above. It appears to me that, on the facts of this case,
if, as here, the first three questions are answered in the affirmative and the
fourth in the negative, the appropriate equitable remedy is that the claimant
is subrogated to the unpaid vendor’s lien as explained in paras 41 and 42
above. On the facts here the Bank is entitled to a lien on the property, which
is in principle an equitable interest which it can enforced by sale. In short,
by effectively reinstating Melissa’s liability under the charge, the remedy of
subrogation is reversing what would otherwise be her unjust enrichment.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accept the submission made on behalf of the Bank that the
analyses in <i>Banque Financière</i> have rationalised the older cases through
the prism of unjust enrichment. <i>Banque Financière</i> was not limited to subrogation
to personal rights. The remedy the House fashioned was subrogation to a
property right but, as the Bank puts it, it was attenuated so as not to grant
RTB a greater right than that for which it had bargained. There is no reason
why, on the facts of this case, the remedy should not be subrogation as
described above, even if the Bank did not retain a property interest in the
proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall. The remedy simply reverses the unjust
enrichment which Melissa would otherwise enjoy by ensuring that the Bank not
only has a personal claim against her but also has an equitable interest in
Great Oak Court, as it would have had if the scheme had gone through in
accordance with the agreement of the Bank and the Menelaou parents. Moreover,
but for the proposed remedy the Bank would lose the benefit it was to receive
from the scheme, namely a charge on Great Oak Court to replace the charges it
had on Rush Green Hall.</a></p><a name="para50">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In reaching these conclusions I have read Lord Carnwath’s judgment in
draft with great interest. My own view is that the principles are somewhat
broader than he suggests.</a></p><a name="para51">

</span>As I see it, these conclusions make it unnecessary to decide whether the
Bank had a security interest in the proceeds of sale that were used to buy
Great Oak Court. In so far as the answer to that may depend upon the true ratio
of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Buhr v Barclays Bank </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1223</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2002] BPIR 25</a> like the Court of Appeal I would prefer to leave
that question for determination in a case in which it arises for decision. In so
far as the Bank relies upon a <i>Quistclose </i>type trust (<i>Quistclose
Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/4.html">[1970] AC 567</a>), arising in a similar
manner to that which arose in <i>Twinsectra v Yardley </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/12.html">[2002] 2 AC 164</a>,
there seems to me to be much to be said for the conclusions reached by Lord
Carnwath. However, in my opinion it is not necessary for the Bank to do so.</p>

</span>Since writing the above I have read Lord Neuberger’s judgment in draft.
I essentially agree with his conclusions and reasoning. I also agree with his
tentative conclusions and reasoning in paras 103, 104 and 106.</a></p><a name="para54">

</span>The one point upon which there is or may be a difference between us is
whether the Bank would have a personal claim in unjust enrichment against
Melissa. For my part I see no reason why it should not in principle have such a
claim provided that it is dealt with as suggested by Lord Neuberger in para 81.
In any event I agree with him that it is not necessary to decide this question
in this appeal for reasons he gives in para 82. I would only say that there
seems to me to be considerable force in his comments in para 81, namely that
the standard response to unjust enrichment is a monetary restitutionary award
in order to reverse the unjust enrichment. This must be left for decision on
another day.</a></p><a name="para55">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts of this case and the findings of the courts below are
explained by Lord Clarke in paras 1-17.</a></p><a name="para56">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question which arises is whether, in the light of those facts, the
Bank is entitled to claim a charge over the freehold of Great Oak Court by
invoking a right to be subrogated to the unpaid vendor’s lien over the freehold
of Great Oak Court (“the Lien”). In considering that issue, I shall adopt the
nomenclature in Lord Clarke’s judgment.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Bank’s primary case involves two steps; the first is that it has a
claim based on unjust enrichment against Melissa; the second step is that that
claim was or should be satisfied by subrogating the Bank to the Lien. Melissa’s
main argument against the first step is that she was innocent of any
wrong-doing and therefore cannot be said to have been unjustly enriched. As to
the second step, her main argument is that subrogation as claimed by the Bank
is not, as a matter of principle, available as a remedy for unjust enrichment
in the circumstances of this case.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Lord Clarke, and with the Court of Appeal, that, despite
Melissa’s arguments to the contrary, each of the two steps in the Bank’s
argument is made out. I am also attracted to the view that the Bank’s case on
the first step could be justified on the alternative basis of an orthodox
proprietary claim rather than on unjust enrichment, which in turn would render
the second step in its case even clearer.</a></p><a name="para59">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Because the appeal raises points of some significance and because the
state of the law appears to be somewhat unclear, I shall explain why I have
reached these conclusions.</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="ParaHeading">Can the Bank establish an unjust enrichment claim against
Melissa?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first step in the Bank’s case is that it has a claim against Melissa
in unjust enrichment. A claim in unjust enrichment requires one to address the
four questions which Lord Clarke sets out in para 18 above. I agree with what
he says in relation to those four questions in this case in paras 19-35 above,
and indeed with the analysis of Floyd LJ in the Court of Appeal at </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1960</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2014] 1 WLR 854</a>, paras 29 to 42. I express the position in my own
words as follows.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer to the first question, namely whether Melissa has been
enriched, would appear to be plainly yes, because she received the freehold of
Great Oak Court (“the freehold”) for nothing. However, although it does not
affect the outcome in the present case, there is much to be said for the view
that the relevant enrichment for present purposes is that she received the
freehold free of any charge, instead of receiving it subject to a charge to
secure her parents’ indebtedness to the Bank (a “Charge”).</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This may be a more accurate way of answering the first question for
present purposes, because the only aspect of Melissa’s enrichment which can be
complained of by anyone arises from the fact that she received the freehold
free of the intended Charge. The fact that the freehold was conveyed to her was
an uncontroversial benefit, but the fact that it was not subject to a Charge was
not just a benefit, but, in the light of the facts surrounding the sale of Rush
Green Hall, the purchase of Great Oak Court and the preparation of the
defective Deed of Charge (“the Deed”), it was accidental and unintended. (The
fact that Melissa held the freehold on trust for herself and her siblings adds
nothing for present purposes.)</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, it might be said to be somewhat artificial to distinguish
between acquisition of the freehold and acquisition of the freehold subject to
the Charge. After all, Great Oak Court could not have been acquired without the
Bank’s agreement that some of the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall could be
used to purchase it, and that agreement was conditional on the grant of the
Charge contemporaneously with the purchase. This is reflected by the
observations of Lord Oliver in <i>Abbey National Building Society v Cann</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/3.html">[1991] 1 AC 56</a>, 92-93, albeit that his observations apply by analogy rather
than directly:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]he acquisition of the legal
estate and the charge are not only precisely simultaneous but indissolubly
bound together. The acquisition of the legal estate is entirely dependent upon
the provision of funds which will have been provided before the conveyance can
take effect and which are provided only against an agreement that the estate
will be charged to secure them. … The reality is that the purchaser of land who
relies upon a building society or bank loan for the completion of his purchase
never in fact acquires anything but an equity of redemption, for the land is, from
the very inception, charged with the amount of the loan without which it could
never have been transferred at all and it was never intended that it should be
otherwise.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn to the second question, namely whether the enrichment was at the
expense of the Bank. Professor Burrows refers to this requirement as being that
“the defendant’s enrichment must come from (be subtracted from) the claimant’s
wealth” – <i>Proprietary Restitution: Unmasking Unjust Enrichment </i>(2001)
117 LQR 412, 415.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Bank had the right to demand the whole of the proceeds of sale of
Rush Green Hall, as the Menelaou parents’ debt to the Bank, which had been
secured on the freehold of Rush Green Hall, exceeded the proceeds of sale.
Instead, the Bank agreed that £875,000 of those proceeds of sale could be used
to fund the purchase of the freehold of Great Oak Court, but only provided that
the Bank was granted a Charge over that freehold at the time of its
acquisition. So the Bank would have had the right to prevent the £875,000 being
used to purchase the freehold if it had not been provided with a valid Charge.
Even assuming (as Melissa asserts) that the Bank had released to the Menelaou
parents £875,000 of the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall, the release was
only on the basis that it would be granted a Charge over Great Oak Court.
Therefore, it seems to me clear that the Bank could have prevented the purchase
proceeding until it had been granted a Charge. Accordingly, again deriving
support from the passage quoted from <i>Abbey National</i>, looking at the
arrangements in relation to the purchase and charging of Great Oak Court, it
seems to me plain that Melissa’s enrichment was at the expense of the Bank.</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That conclusion is reinforced (if reinforcement is needed) by the point
made by Lord Clarke in para 25 above, reflecting the realistic approach of the
House of Lords in <i>Abbey National</i>, that it is appropriate not merely to
consider the purchase of, and charge over, Great Oak Court as a single
composite transaction. It is also appropriate in the present case to treat the
sale of Rush Green Hall and the purchase of Great Oak Court as one scheme, at
least for present purposes. I see nothing in any of the judgments in <i>Scott v
Southern Pacific Mortgages Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/52.html">[2014] UKSC 52</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/52.html">[2015] 1 AC 385</a> (<i>sub nom Mortgage
Business plc v O’Shaughnessy</i>) which casts doubt on that approach.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If one regards the enrichment as having the freehold uncharged rather
than subject to a Charge, it therefore seems clear that that enrichment was at
the Bank’s expense. One gets the same answer if Melissa’s enrichment is
regarded as being the freehold in its entirety: that enrichment would be at the
expense of the Bank, albeit only to the extent that the freehold was uncharged
rather than subject to the Charge, and therefore the points made in paras 66-67
above would apply with equal force.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The third question is whether the enrichment was unjust. At first sight,
there may appear to be some attraction in Melissa’s argument that, as between
the Bank and herself, her enrichment was not unjust. After all, as Mr Mark
Warwick QC pointed out, she owed the Bank nothing, she was wholly unaware of a
prospective or actual charge, and she was innocent of any oversight, let alone
any wrong-doing, whether before, during or after the sale of Rush Green Hall
and the purchase of Great Oak Court.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer to that contention, in my view, lies in the fact that Melissa
received the freehold as a gift from her parents. Had she been a <i>bona fide </i>purchaser
for full value, it may very well have been impossible to characterise her
enrichment as unjust, especially if she had no notice of the Bank’s rights. If
she had paid a small sum to her parents for her acquisition, a difficult
question might have had to be faced, although, as at present advised, I think
that her enrichment would still have been unjust, but the extent of any unjust
enrichment would be reduced by the small sum. But she paid nothing, and she
therefore cannot, in my view, be in any better position than her parents so far
as the Bank’s claim is concerned. And there can be no doubt that, if the
Menelaou parents, rather than directing the transfer to Melissa, had acquired
the freehold themselves in circumstances where the Deed was for some reason
invalid, the Bank would have had a claim against them in unjust enrichment.</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Again, it seems to me to be easier to see why Melissa’s enrichment
should be characterised as unjust if her enrichment is treated as being the
receipt of the freehold uncharged instead of subject to the Charge. Her parents
were quite properly able to direct the transfer of the freehold of Great Oak
Court to Melissa, but they were not properly entitled, so far as the Bank was
concerned, to direct the transfer to her of the unencumbered freehold; they
were only properly able, at least as against the Bank, to direct the transfer
to her of the freehold subject to a Charge.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Warwick suggested that this analysis could be called into question by
considering the likely outcome if the Menelaou parents had decided to direct
the freehold of Great Oak Court to be transferred to a charity, instead of
their daughter. I agree that the outcome would be no different, but I see no
difficulties in accepting that the Bank would in those circumstances have had a
claim in unjust enrichment against the charity.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A variant of Mr Warwick’s argument on this third aspect is the
contention that, if the Bank could otherwise mount a valid unjust enrichment
claim, that claim cannot succeed against Melissa, as she was only an “indirect
recipient” of any enrichment, to use the language Goff &amp; Jones<i> </i>on <i>The
Law of Unjust Enrichment</i>,<i> </i>8th ed (2012), eds Professors C Mitchell,
P Mitchell and Watterson, paras 6-12ff and in Ben McFarlane’s article <i>Unjust
Enrichment, Property Rights, and Indirect Recipients </i>(2009) 17 RLR 37. It is
fair to say that there was a tripartite relationship in this case, in the sense
that not merely Melissa and the Bank, but also the Menelaou parents, were
parties to the arrangements which gave rise to the alleged unjust enrichment.
However, as already explained above, there was in reality a single transaction,
and it was from that transaction that Melissa directly benefitted, even though
the benefit was effected at the direction of the Menelaou parents. The benefit
to Melissa was direct because it arose as the immediate and inevitable result
of the very transaction to which she was party and which gave rise to the
unjust enrichment (in contrast to the examples at the beginning of Professor McFarlane’s
article). I should add that, even if Melissa could be characterised as an
indirect recipient of any enrichment, I do not consider that that would assist
her: she would still properly be liable on the facts of this case, essentially
for the same reasons.</a></p><a name="para73">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As for the fourth question, it appears to me that, if (as I consider)
the first three questions are answered in the Bank’s favour, there is no
special reason precluding the conclusion that the Bank had a valid claim in
unjust enrichment against Melissa.</a></p><a name="para74">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As already mentioned, the fact that Melissa did not know of the
circumstances which caused her enrichment to be unjust does not alter the fact
that she was unjustly enriched; nor does it alter the extent of her unjust
enrichment. However, it does render it more likely that she would be able to
rely on subsequent events to give rise to an innocent change of position
defence to a claim based on the unjust enrichment. However, no such defence
appears to arise in this case.</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was rather tentatively suggested that the Bank should have no right
to claim in unjust enrichment against Melissa, as it had a cast-iron case for
recovering all its losses arising from the defective Deed from Boulters. There
is nothing in that point. Boulters’ liability in no way impinges on the
question whether, and to what extent, Melissa was unjustly enriched at the
expense of the Bank: the Bank’s claim against Boulters is <i>res inter alios
acta </i>so far as Melissa is concerned. (Further, although the point was not
argued, it may well be that, if the Bank had recovered damages from Boulters,
then Boulters would be subrogated to the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim against
Melissa.)</a></p><a name="para76">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Standing back, any fair-minded person would say that, as a matter of
fairness and common sense, by acquiring the freehold from any Charge, Melissa
was unjustly enriched at the expense of the Bank, albeit not because of any
fault of hers. Tomlinson LJ’s analysis in the Court of Appeal, as set out by
Lord Clarke in para 33 above, accurately summarises the position. Of course,
fairness and common sense cannot safely be relied as the sole touchstones as to
whether there has been unjust enrichment as a matter of law. In that
connection, like Lord Clarke, I would commend Henderson J’s observations in <i>Investment
Trust Companies v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/458.html">[2012] EWHC 458 (Ch)</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/458.html">[2012] STC 1150</a>, paras 67-68, as containing what Floyd LJ called a “thoughtful and
valuable” approach, while rightly not laying down rigid principles.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Can the Bank invoke subrogation on the basis of its unjust
enrichment claim?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn then to the second step, namely whether the Bank’s claim in
unjust enrichment can properly be satisfied by holding that it is subrogated to
the Lien over the freehold to the extent of the price payable for the freehold,
namely £875,000. (And in that connection, the fact that 10% of the £875,000 had
already been paid as a deposit is irrelevant for present purposes, as the
balance had to be paid to “rescue” the deposit.)</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Given that the Bank has a claim based on unjust enrichment against
Melissa to the extent described above, it is hard to identify a more
appropriate remedy for the Bank to obtain against Melissa. Subrogation to the
Lien would accord to the Bank, and impose on Melissa, a right very similar to,
although rather less in value than, that which the Bank should have had. It would
give the Bank a lien instead of a formal charge, and it would be in the sum of
£875,000 (plus interest), rather than the larger debt, well over £1m at the
time of the purchase of the freehold, owed by the Menelaou parents to the Bank.</a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An award of financial compensation might seem rather less appropriate.
It was never intended that the Bank should have any personal claim against
Melissa, merely that the freehold which she owned would be charged with the
Menelaou parents’ debt to the Bank. Even if the compensation was limited to
£875,000 (plus interest), it could prejudice Melissa - for instance, if the
freehold declined in value as a result of a fall in the property market
subsequent to her acquisition.</a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, it is fair to say that the standard response to unjust
enrichment is a “monetary restitutionary award”, to use the terminology adopted
by in <i>A Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment</i> (Burrows et
al, 2012), article 34, in order to reverse the unjust enrichment. In this case,
the unjust enrichment could be quantified at £875,000, its value at the time it
was conferred, or the difference in the value of the freehold uncharged and
subject to the Charge at the date of the assessment of the unjust enrichment
(or possibly at some other date). In so far as the quantification would result
in an unfair or oppressive sum, the court could adjust the sum to avoid any
unfairness or oppression.</a></p><a name="para81">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not necessary for the purpose of the present appeal to decide
whether the Bank has a monetary claim against Melissa in the light of her
unjust enrichment, let alone to determine the precise amount which the Bank
could seek from her on that basis, or to decide whether the existence of any
monetary claim would be affected by the subrogation claim. Nor would it be
appropriate to do so, given that none of these points was debated in any detail
on this appeal: indeed, the issue of whether the Bank had a money claim against
Melissa was barely touched on at all (and no complaint is thereby intended).</a></p><a name="para82">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning now to the law, the circumstances in which an unpaid vendor’s
lien typically arises and the circumstances in which subrogation typically can
be claimed have been summarised by Millett LJ and Walton J respectively in the
passages quoted by Lord Clarke in paras 41 and 39 above.</a></p><a name="para83">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the course of his attractive argument on behalf of Melissa, Mr
Warwick contended that, because the Bank’s case against Melissa was based on
unjust enrichment, it could not justify the Bank’s claim to be subrogated to
the Lien. His contention was that the decided cases and judicial dicta which
establish a right to be subrogated to a charge or a debt, all involved the
money coming from the person who establishes subrogation being used to pay off

</span>It is true that it can be fairly argued that the dicta in those cases as
to when and how subrogation could arise do not apply here. However, there is
nothing in those dicta to suggest that the judges in any of those cases were
purporting to give an exclusive explanation or definition of when subrogation
can arise. Further, as Mr Rainey QC, for the Bank, pointed out in his clear
argument, no consideration was given in those cases to analysing whether actual
ownership of the money on the part of the person claiming subrogation was
needed. Nonetheless, that does not alter the point that subrogation should be
accorded to the Bank in this case only if it can be achieved in accordance with
principle.</a></p><a name="para85">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, Mr Warwick’s argument involves assuming that the
circumstances in which subrogation can be claimed are more limited than they
really are. That is made good by two decisions of the House of Lords. In <i>Orakpo
v Manson Investments Ltd</i> [1978] AC 95, 104, Lord Diplock explained that there
were “some circumstances in which the remedy [for unjust enrichment] takes the
form of ‘subrogation’, but this expression embraces more than a single concept
in English law”. He went on to describe subrogation as “a convenient way of
describing a transfer of rights from one person to another, without assignment
or assent of the person from whom the rights are transferred and which takes
place by operation of law in a whole variety of widely different circumstances”.
He described a case where a person who pays off a secured lender as being “[o]ne
of the sets of circumstances in which a right of subrogation arises”.</a></p><a name="para86">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the same case at p 110, Lord Salmon expressed himself very broadly,
suggesting that “[t]he test as to whether the courts will apply the doctrine of
subrogation to the facts of any particular case is entirely empirical” and that
the principle was that “the doctrine will be applied only when the courts are
satisfied that reason and justice demand that it should be”. Lord Edmund-Davies
suggested at p 112 that “there is no reason why it should be confined to the
hitherto-recognised categories”. And, to much the same effect, Slade LJ
described “the doctrine of subrogation” as “a flexible one, capable of giving a
remedy in many and various situations” in <i>In re T H Knitwear (Wholesale) Ltd
</i>[1988] Ch 275, 286F.</a></p><a name="para87">

</span>The opinion of Lord Hoffmann in the more recent decision of the House of
Lords in <i>Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/7.html">[1999] 1 AC 221</a> includes some illuminating remarks about subrogation, which are much in
point for present purposes. At p 231G-H, having described subrogation in the
traditional case as “a contractual arrangement for the transfer of rights
against third parties [which] is founded upon the common intention of the
parties”, he went on to say that “the term is also used to describe an
equitable remedy to reverse or prevent unjust enrichment which is not based
upon any agreement or common intention of the party enriched and the party
deprived”. Then, at pp 231H-232A, he described the former principle as “part of
the law of contract” and the latter, which seems, at least on the face of it,
to cover the present case, as “part of the law of restitution”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89">89.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann’s subsequent analysis at p 232B-H confirms that the Bank’s
subrogation claim in this case should not be in difficulties because Melissa
was wholly ignorant of, and in no way responsible for, the fact that the Bank
was intended to have a charge over the freehold (and, as Lord Hoffmann
explained, this is confirmed by a number of earlier decisions including two of
the cases relied on by Mr Warwick, namely <i>Chetwynd </i>and <i>Butler</i>).
Thus, at p 234B-D, Lord Hoffmann observed that it was “a mistake to regard the
availability of subrogation as a remedy to prevent unjust enrichment as turning
entirely upon the question of intention” (although he also said that this does
not “mean that questions of intention may not be highly relevant to the
question whether or not enrichment has been unjust”). He also expressed the
view that “intention has played so prominent a part in the earlier cases …
because of the influence of cases on contractual subrogation”, and that, in a
case of a restitutionary subrogation claim, the appropriate questions were, in
effect, those identified by Lord Clarke at para 18 above.</a></p><a name="para89">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At p 236E, Lord Hoffmann explained that subrogation was “not a right or
a cause of action but an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise
be unjustly enriched”. Accordingly, as he went on to say, the notion (in this
case) of the unpaid vendor’s lien being “kept alive” for the benefit of the
Bank was “not a literal truth but rather a metaphor or analogy” (p 236D). Particularly
significantly for present purposes, Lord Hoffmann said at p 236F that
subrogation is “an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise be
unjustly enriched” and “a means by which the court regulates the legal
relationships between a plaintiff and a defendant … in order to prevent unjust enrichment”.
Accordingly, he said, it would “not by any means follow that the [Bank] must
for all purposes be treated as an actual assignee of the benefit of the [unpaid
vendor’s lien] and, in particular, that [it] would be so treated in relation to
someone who would not be unjustly enriched” (p 236G).</a></p><a name="para90">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the observations in <i>Orakpo </i>and, even more, in <i>Banque
Financière</i>,<i> </i>support the Bank’s claim to be subrogated to the Lien as
a result of what happened in this case. It seems to me that this view is
supported by the views expressed by the current editors of <i>Goff &amp; Jones </i>at
para 39-10, where they describe “the true position” as that explained by Lord
Hoffmann in the passage quoted in para 90 above from <i>Banque Financière </i>at
p 236F. The editors go on to say at para 39-12 that “subrogation to extinguished
rights is therefore a remedy that reverses unjust enrichment of a discharged
debtor … which follows from the discharge of a debt, by affording the claimant
new rights which prima facie replicate the creditor’s extinguished rights”. The
same point is made in the following paragraphs. For instance in para 39-16, it
is suggested that “the subrogation cases can all be explained” on “the ground
for restitution that makes it unjust for the debtor … to be enriched at the
claimant’s expense”.</a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that there is nothing in Chapter 39 of <i>Goff and Jones</i>
which deals with what is said to be the problem for the Bank in this case,
namely that the money used to pay off the secured creditor (ie the unpaid
vendor) did not emanate from the Bank itself. However, that does not seem to me
to present the Bank with a problem in relation to its claim for subrogation.
For the reasons given in paras 66-68 above, the Bank has established that
Melissa’s enrichment was at its expense even though the money did not emanate
from the Bank directly, so that its unjust enrichment is made out against her.
I do not see why the Bank need establish anything more in this case in order to
make good its case to be subrogated to the Lien. It is right to add that para
7-02 of <i>Geoff &amp; Jones</i>, cited by Lord Carnwath in para 131 could be
read as suggesting that a more stringent test has to be satisfied before the
court will award subrogation (and see also paras 37-9 and 37-10). However, in
the light of <i>Orakpo</i> and <i>Banque Financière</i>, I do not consider that
those paragraphs can be read in this way.</a></p><a name="para92">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, at para 6-30 of <i>Goff &amp; Jones</i>, the editors describe
the grant by the House of Lords in <i>Banque Financière </i>of a subrogation
remedy as “unprecedented”. However that was primarily because subrogation was accorded
to a party who thereby obtained, as Lord Hoffmann himself put it at p 229, “far
greater security than it ever bargained for”, and perhaps also because of the
adjustments which had to be made to the subrogated right in order to achieve
equity (discussed in <i>Goff &amp; Jones </i>at paras 39-44 and 39-45). The
Bank’s claim to subrogation in this case is stronger in the sense that neither
of those two points can be raised against it in this case.</a></p><a name="para93">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Despite the broad statements in <i>Banque</i> <i>Financière</i>, what is
said in Chapter 39 of <i>Goff &amp; Jones</i>,<i> </i>and the way in which Lord
Salmon and Lord Edmund-Davies expressed themselves in <i>Orakpo</i>, the
combination of facts that (i) the Bank has a claim in unjust enrichment against
Melissa arising out of her acquisition of the freehold, (ii) subrogation is a
remedy which can be accorded to reverse unjust enrichment, (iii) the Lien arose
out of the transaction giving rise to the acquisition, and (iv) the Lien is a
right to which it is legally possible to subrogate, is not enough to justify
the conclusion that the Bank should be subrogated to the Lien. There has to be
a principled case to support such a conclusion.</a></p><a name="para94">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94"></a><a name="para95">95.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having said that, it seems to me that the conclusion is supported by
principle. In addition to the general points identified in the previous
paragraph, it appears to me that the following five points, when taken
together, establish the Bank’s subrogation claim. (i) The freehold was acquired
by being purchased through Boulters for £875,000; (ii) £875,000 was a sum which
the Bank could have demanded from Boulters, and it only agreed to its being
used to purchase the freehold if the Bank was granted a Charge; (iii) without
that agreement, there would have been no £875,000 to purchase the freehold,
(iv) owing to an oversight, the Bank was not granted a valid Charge; (v) the
payment of £875,000 to purchase the freehold discharged the Lien.</a></p><a name="para95">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In those circumstances, it is hard to see why subrogating the Bank to
the unpaid vendor’s lien is not an appropriate way to remedy the unjust enrichment.
I do not consider that the reasoning in <i>Boscawen v Bajwa </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a> presents a problem. In that case, at pp 334D and 335C, Millett LJ discussed
in instructive detail both tracing, which he explained was “a process”, and
subrogation, which he described as “a remedy”. (On reflection, I wonder whether
the distinction, despite the approval of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Banque Financière </i>at
p 236E of the description of subrogation as a remedy, is as satisfactory as it
seems at first sight. It seems to me questionable whether a sharp distinction
can satisfactorily be drawn between a process and a remedy, but the point has
no effect on the outcome of this case.)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97">97.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While I accept that Millett LJ treated tracing as the appropriate
process to achieve subrogation in <i>Boscawen</i>, there are two important
caveats for present purposes. First, he nowhere stated that subrogation was an
impermissible remedy if tracing was not an available prior process. Secondly,
as Mr Rainey QC pointed out, at p 339A-B Millett LJ said that it would be
“perilous to extrapolate from one set of circumstances where the court has
required a particular precondition to be satisfied before the remedy of
subrogation can be granted a general rule which makes that requirement a
precondition which must be satisfied in other and different circumstances”.
Similarly, at p 334H, Millett LJ described subrogation as a remedy which “will
be fashioned to the circumstances”.</a></p><a name="para97">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97"></a><a name="para98">98.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor do I think that Lord Millett’s statement in <i>Foskett v McKeown </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/29.html">[2001] 1 AC 102</a>, p 127F about property rights being “determined by fixed rules” and
not being discretionary, casts doubt on my conclusion in this case. His
analysis in that case has its critics – see eg Burrows,<i> </i>(2001) 117 LQR
412, 417 and <i>The Law of Restitution</i>,<i> </i>3rd ed (2011), pp 140,
170-171 and 432-434, and Mitchell and Watterson, <i>Subrogation: Law and
Practice </i>(2007), para 6.50. However, and more to the point, Lord Millett’s
remarks were directed to proprietary claims not unjust enrichment claims. Lord
Millett made that clear in a passage at p 129E-G, where he said, <i>inter alia</i>,
that one must distinguish between a claim brought “to vindicate … property
rights” and one brought “to reverse unjust enrichment”, and that <i>Foskett </i>was
an example of the former. This point was also made by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and
Lord Hoffmann at pp 108F and 115G respectively.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99">99.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally on this aspect, it is worth mentioning that Melissa’s case
represents a triumph of form over substance, or, to use the words of Lord Steyn
in <i>Banque Financière </i>at 227C, “pure formalism”. It would have been
perfectly open to the Bank to have requested Boulters to pay the whole proceeds
of the sale of Rush Green Hall to the Bank, with the Bank then remitting back
to Boulters the £875,000 needed to purchase Great Oak Court, on the basis that
it would be subject to a charge in favour of the Bank to secure the Menelaou
parents’ indebtedness. If that had happened, and the Menelaou parents had then
directed the transfer of Great Oak Court to Melissa, and the defective Deed had
been executed, it is very difficult to see why the Bank could not have claimed
subrogation to the unpaid vendor’s lien. If Melissa’s case on this appeal is
right, the fact that the Bank sensibly short-circuited the process, and agreed
that the £875,000 could be retained by Boulters to purchase Great Oak Court,
would mean that a small and practical change, of no apparent commercial
significance, results in a substantially different commercial outcome. Such an
outcome is, of course, possible, but its unattractiveness tends to support the
conclusion which I have reached.</a></p><a name="para99">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99"></a><a name="para100">100.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This leads conveniently to the final point, namely whether the Bank’s
claim to be subrogated to the unpaid vendor’s lien could in fact be justified
by a simpler and less potentially controversial route. At least on the basis of
the arguments we have heard, I am very sympathetic to the notion that the Bank
had a proprietary interest in the £875,000 which was used to purchase Great Oak
Court, and if that is right, its subrogation claim becomes relatively
uncontroversial. I am, however, reluctant to express a concluded view on the
topic, as the argument was developed very shortly, although it is fair to say
that it was considered (and rejected) at first instance, albeit on a somewhat
different basis from that which currently appeals to me.</a></p><a name="para100">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, I would be inclined substantially to agree with the
analysis of Lord Carnwath in paras 135-139 of his judgment.</a></p><a name="para101">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para101"></a><a name="para102">102.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It seems to me difficult, at least on the basis of the relatively
limited argument we have heard, to argue against the proposition that the Bank
had a proprietary interest in the £875,000 which was used to purchase Great Oak
Court. What was intended to happen on 12 September 2006 was that the proceeds
of sale of Rush Green Hall, which was charged to the Bank for a debt in excess
of those proceeds, were split into two portions, one of which was to be paid to
the Bank to reduce the debt, and the other of which was to be used to purchase
Great Oak Court on terms that the Bank was to have charge over it for the
outstanding indebtedness. In those circumstances, it would seem, either the
second portion was the Bank’s money beneficially subject to its agreement that
the money could be used to purchase Great Oak Court, or it was the Menelaou
parents’ money beneficially subject to the Bank’s right to require it to be
paid to the Bank to reduce the Menelaou parents’ debt unless it was used to
purchase Great Oak Court subject to the Charge.</a></p><a name="para102">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para102"></a><a name="para103">103.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When it comes to the beneficial interests in this case, as I see it at
the moment, the position would be as follows. There would be little need to
resort to <i>Quistclose Investments v Rolls Razor Ltd </i>[1970] AC 597,
because there could be no doubt but that Boulters held the £875,000 on trust:
it was plainly not their money beneficially. Both the Menelaou parents and the
Bank were their clients towards whom they had contractual and equitable duties,
and, more particularly, both of whom had an interest in the £875,000. If the
Bank beneficially owned the £875,000 (subject to its agreement that the
Menelaou parents could use it to purchase Great Oak Court, subject to the
Charge), <i>cadit quaestio </i>so far as the Bank’s subrogation to the Lien is
concerned, as I see it: the Bank’s money was used to redeem the Lien.<i> </i>Assuming,
however, that the Menelaou parents were the beneficial owners of the £875,000,
the Bank would, in my view, have had the right of requiring that sum to be used
to purchase Great Oak Court subject to a Charge back in favour of the Bank,
failing which the Bank would have the right to demand that that sum be paid to
it. I find it hard to see why that would not have given the Bank a sufficient
interest in the £875,000 to enable it to claim to be subrogated to the Lien,
even on Melissa’s restricted view of subrogation.</a></p><a name="para103">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para103"></a><a name="para104">104.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may well be that the Bank could also claim that, if the £875,000 was
to be treated as beneficially owned by the Menelaou parents, it was nonetheless
subject to a charge in favour of the Bank, as discussed by Arden LJ in <i>Buhr
v Barclays Bank plc </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1223</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2002] BPIR 25</a>, para 45. This argument
was rejected by the Judge at first instance in this case – see at <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/1991.html">[2012] EWHC 1991 (Ch)</a>, paras 15-17. It is unnecessary and inappropriate to discuss that
possibility further, as it was barely touched on in argument.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In those circumstances, I would dismiss Melissa’s appeal on the basis
that the Bank has a valid unjust enrichment claim against her which is properly
reflected in the Bank’s claim to be subrogated to the unpaid vendor’s lien over
the freehold of Great Oak Court.</a></p><a name="para105">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I add this. My strong, if provisional, opinion that the Bank had a
proprietary interest in the £875,000 which was used to purchase the freehold
leads me to wonder whether the conclusion that the Bank’s unjust enrichment
claim is satisfied by subrogation could in fact be regarded as controversial,
even before <i>Orakpo </i>and <i>Banque Financière </i>were decided. The
reasons which persuade me that the unjust enrichment claim can properly be
satisfied by subrogation to the Lien (see paras 91-95 above) are precious close
to those which persuade me that there is a very strong case for saying that the
Bank had a proprietary interest in the £875,000 (see para 103 above).</a></p><a name="para106">

doctrines. As Lord Millett explained in <i>Foskett v McKeown </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/29.html">[2001] 1 AC 102</a>, 129 (cited by Lord Clarke at para 38), there is a clear distinction of
principle between a claim to enforce property rights and a claim for unjust
enrichment. Earlier in the same judgment (at p 127F) he had emphasised that
property rights are to be determined “by fixed rules and settled principles”,
not by discretion or policy. Subrogation to a vendor’s lien is a claim to a
property right, but it is, as Lord Clarke acknowledges, a less than
straightforward concept. It should not be extended, nor should the established
rules be distorted, without good reason.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, in the light of some decades of academic discussion and of
the authorities reviewed by Lord Clarke, it is surely time for the principles
of restitution or unjust enrichment to be allowed to stand on their own feet. A
proprietary remedy may arguably be justified because, as Lord Neuberger says
(paras 79-80), such a remedy, rather than a personal remedy, is the most
appropriate response to the unjust enrichment found in this case; but not
because of some tenuous relationship with a vendor’s lien which has no
continuing existence or practical relevance. However, that is not how the case
has been argued, and, since it is not necessary for my decision on the appeal,
I shall limit my observations on those wider issues.</a></p><a name="para109">

</span>In this judgment I will take the facts as set out by Lord Clarke. I
would only observe that I approach those facts without any particular
predisposition in favour of the Bank’s claim. As Mr Warwick points out, if
Melissa was enriched, it was because her parents gave to her, and to her two
younger siblings, some of the proceeds of sale of their property, which she
received in good faith. In the same way, Melissa’s older sister, Danielle, was
enriched because she also received some of the proceeds of Rush Green Hall. Neither
was aware of any interest of the Bank, and in Danielle’s case none has been
asserted. Melissa’s ignorance of the Bank’s claim is the result of their own
solicitors’ incompetence, not of any fault on her part.</a></p><a name="para110">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[W]here A’s money is used to pay
off the claim of B, who is a secured creditor, A is entitled to be regarded in
equity as having had an assignment to him of B’s rights as a secured creditor.
… It finds one of its chief uses in the situation where one person advances
money on the understanding that he is to have certain security for the money he
has advanced, and, for one reason or another, he does not receive the promised
security. In such a case he is nevertheless to be subrogated to the rights of
any other person who at the relevant time had any security over the same property
and whose debts have been discharged, in whole or in part, by the money so
provided by him.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para112">112.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Probably the fullest textbook discussion of the subject is to be found
in Mitchell and Watterson <i>Subrogation Law and Practice </i>(2007) (It is
noteworthy that both authors are also editors of the later edition of <i>Goff
&amp; Jones</i> (2011) to which I shall come<i>.</i>) Under the heading
“transfer of extinguished proprietary rights” (para 3.26-8) the authors trace
the origins of the rule whereby those whose money is used to pay off on land
are “presumptively entitled to ‘acquire” the charge for their own benefit”
(derived from <i>Patten v Bond </i>(1889) 60 LT 583). They describe as
“anomalous” the extension of the rule beyond payments by someone with an
existing interest in the land which requires protection. The anomaly lies in
the absence of any sound policy reason to treat such a person any differently
to any other person who has voluntarily paid off a person’s debt, and “for the
more substantial reason that ‘liabilities are not to be forced on people behind
their backs’” (citing <i>Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1886/230.html">(1886) 34 Ch D 234</a>, 248 per Bowen LJ). However, as they observe the principle became
well-established in the case-law, approved for example in the Privy Council in <i>Ghana
Commercial Bank v Chandiram </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1960/1960_20.html">[1960] AC 732</a>, the justification for
acquisition of the security being that the claimant was “presumed to have
intended this at the time when they parted with the money”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The application of the concept in the context of an unpaid vendor's lien
is also well-established, but no less anomalous. <i>Burston </i>itself related
to such a claim. The claim failed because, by taking a legal charge over the
same property (even though invalid against the liquidator by reason of failure
to register under the Companies Act 1948), the lien had been lost “either as a
result of the doctrine of merger or by presumed intention to waive the unpaid
vendor’s lien” (p 1653C).</a></p><a name="para113">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The earliest example in the cases cited to the court was <i>Thurstan v
Nottingham Permanent Benefit Building Society</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1901/187.html">[1902] 1 Ch 1</a>. On a purchase
of land by an infant, £250 of the purchase money was paid on her behalf by the
building society to the vendor subject to a mortgage. Although the mortgage was
held to be void because of the infancy, the Society was subrogated to, and so
able to enforce, the vendor’s lien. Vaughan Williams LJ, after some initial
uncertainty and consultation with his colleagues, concluded at pp 9-10:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the society, having paid off the
vendor, have a right to the remedies of the vendor – have a right, that is, to
enforce the vendor’s lien. It is true that the society were not the vendors,
but, having paid off the vendor, the society, as against the purchaser, stand
in the place of the vendor.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115">115.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At first sight it seems odd that the Society, having failed due to its
own mistake of law to get the security which it wanted, was able to revive and
take advantage of a different security designed for a different purpose and a
different person. As Floyd LJ observed in the Court of Appeal (para 15), the
concept, although well-established, is not altogether straightforward:</a></p><a name="para115">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A third party who provides some
or all of the purchase money for a purchaser, thereby discharging the
obligation to the vendor, can claim the benefit of the unpaid vendor’s lien by
subrogation. This is so even after the lien has been, as between vendor and
purchaser, extinguished. It is not intuitively clear how, or why, this should
be the case. How is the unpaid vendor’s lien transferred from the vendor to the
third party? It might be thought that once the obligation in question has been
extinguished, there is nothing which the vendor could transfer. Even if there
was something to transfer, by what legal mechanism does the transfer take
place? There has been no assignment.” (para 17)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115"></a><a name="para116">116.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As he explained, Lord Hoffmann made some attempt to address such
conceptual concerns in <i>Banque Financière</i>:</a></p><a name="para116">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para116">“In my view, the phrase ‘keeping
the charge alive’ needs to be handled with some care. It is not a literal truth
but rather a metaphor or analogy: see Birks, <i>An Introduction to the Law of
Restitution</i>, pp 93-97. In a case in which the whole of the secured debt is
repaid, the charge is not kept alive at all. It is discharged and ceases to
exist. … It is important to remember that, as Millett LJ pointed out in <i>Boscawen
v Bajwa</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a>, 335, subrogation is not a right or a cause of
action but an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise be unjustly
enriched. It is a means by which the court regulates the legal relationships
between a plaintiff and a defendant or defendants in order to prevent unjust
enrichment. When judges say that the charge is ‘kept alive’ for the benefit of
the plaintiff, what they mean is that his legal relations with a defendant who
would otherwise be unjustly enriched are regulated as if the benefit of the
charge had been assigned to him. It does not by any means follow that the
plaintiff must for all purposes be treated as an actual assignee of the benefit
of the charge and, in particular, that he would be so treated in relation to
someone who would not be unjustly enriched.”(P 236D-E)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para117">117.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not clear to me, with respect, how describing the concept as a
“metaphor” adds anything by way of explanatory force. I note that in the
passage cited by Lord Hoffmann, Professor Birks began by observing that in the
law of restitution, subrogation “really adds nothing” to the techniques
otherwise available; “it is in the nature of a metaphor which can be done
without” (<i>ibid </i>p 93). Thirty years on, I would respectfully agree. In
the context of the law of unjust enrichment, the issue should be the nature of
the appropriate remedy, not whether it conforms to an analogy derived from some
other area of the law.</a></p><a name="para117">

</span>In the Court of Appeal (as in this court) the appellant submitted that,
there was no justification for extending the rules of subrogation so as to
provide a proprietary remedy in this case. A proprietary claim based on
subrogation to vendor’s lien is available only to a claimant who can show that the
purchase price has been paid off by use of his own money. That is a common
feature of all the cases in which such a claim has been allowed. It is
supported by the leading modern authority: <i>Boscawen v Bajwa</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd LJ acknowledged that no case had been cited to the court in which “a
lender had been entitled to a remedy of subrogation when that lender had not
advanced funds” (para 43). However, he considered that there was no strict
requirement to that effect. He described the “unusual feature of the present
case” that the Bank provided the value “by agreeing to release a security
interest rather than by advancing specific funds”. The appellant had relied on <i>Bankers
Trust Co v Namdar</i> [1997] NPC 22; [1997] EGCS 20, in which subrogation had
been denied because, in the words of Peter Gibson LJ:</a></p><a name="para119">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I cannot see how the Bank can be
afforded the remedy of subrogation in circumstances which, as I see it in
agreement with the Judge, the Bank <i>cannot properly be said to be the
provider of the money used to discharge the debt </i>owed to it by Mr and Mrs
Namdar.” (Floyd LJ’s emphasis)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the present case, however, Floyd LJ thought it
sufficient the Bank had been “a provider of the funds” as a matter of “economic
reality”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The mere fact that the claimant
does some act in reliance on which there is a transfer of value between
different parties is not sufficient. … When the Bank gave its undertaking to
release its charges on Rush Green Hall, and thus release the purchase moneys
for the purchase of Great Oak Court, there was, as I have held, a transfer of
value from the Bank to Melissa. Moreover, if one asks Peter Gibson LJ’s
question, namely whether it can properly be said that the Bank ‘is the provider
of the money used to discharge the debt’, the answer in the present case is
that it is. Certainly that is true if one asks whether the Bank is the source
of the moneys used as a matter of economic reality. I therefore see no reason
in principle or justice why the Bank should not be entitled to the remedy of
subrogation.” (para 48)</p>

</span>Moses LJ preferred to speak of a “sufficiently close causal connection”,
established by showing that, “but for” the Bank’s agreement to release its
charges over Rush Green Hall, Great Oak Court would never have been purchased
and the obligation to pay its vendors would never have been satisfied. In his
view, there was no need to invoke the “somewhat fuzzy concept” of economic
reality (paras 61-62).</a></p><a name="para120">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the strict approach advocated by the appellant gains strong
support from the judgment of Millett LJ in <i>Boscawen v Bajwa</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a>. It is the leading modern authority on the application of principles of
tracing and subrogation in a context not dissimilar to the present. As has been
seen, it was cited with approval by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Banque Financière </i>at
p 233F (“a valuable and illuminating analysis of the remedy of subrogation”).
Because of its acknowledged importance in this area of the law, it justifies
careful examination. Indeed, if the test was as flexible as that favoured by
the Court of Appeal in this case, much of the discussion in that judgment would
have been redundant.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts (as in the present case) involved a failure by solicitors to complete
a transaction in the way intended by the main parties. A much simplified
account will suffice. A building society (“Abbey National”) agreed to make an
advance to clients for the purchase of a property from the defendant (Mr Bajwa)
to be secured on a first legal charge. The property was subject to an existing
mortgage in favour of another building society (“Halifax”). Abbey National paid
the money to solicitors (Dave &amp; Co) acting jointly for the society and the
purchaser, on terms which obliged them to use the money for the purchase, and
to return it if for any reason completion did not take place. They transferred
it to the vendors’ solicitors (Hill Lawson) to hold to their order pending
completion. Before completion Hill Lawson sent the money to Halifax in
discharge of their mortgage, after which the sale fell through. In response to
a subsequent claim to the property by judgment creditors of Mr Bajwa, the Abbey
National claimed to be subrogated to the Halifax mortgage.</a></p><a name="para122">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para122"></a><a name="para123">123.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was held (in the words of the headnote) that:</a></p><a name="para123">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the money used by the vendor’s
solicitors to discharge the mortgage had been held by the purchasers’
solicitors as trust money for the building society and by the vendor’s
solicitors to the purchasers’ solicitors’ order pending completion of the
purchase; that, therefore, the money could be traced into the payment and the
vendor’s solicitors in making it had to be taken to have intended to keep the
mortgage alive for the benefit of the building society; and that, accordingly,
the building society was entitled, by way of subrogation, to a charge on the
proceeds of sale of the property in priority to the plaintiffs.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The headnote rightly highlights the importance of
establishing a “tracing link” between the plaintiffs’ money and the money used
to discharge the mortgage, leading to a presumed intention to keep the mortgage
alive for the plaintiff’s benefit.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Millett LJ’s judgment needs to be read in the context of the issues
before him. The main issue before the Court of Appeal was whether, in allowing
the claim, the judge had “made an impermissible aggregation” of two different
equitable doctrines, subrogation and tracing (p 333D-G). As Millett LJ
explained, these arguments showed a “confusion of thought” as to the nature of
“tracing”:</a></p><a name="para124">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Tracing properly so-called,
however, is neither a claim nor a remedy but a process. … It is the process by
which the plaintiff traces what has happened to his property, identifies the
persons who have handled or received it, and justifies his claim that the money
which they handled or received (and, if necessary, which they still retain) can
properly be regarded as representing his property. …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para124"></a><a name="para125">125.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The process of tracing was to be distinguished from the “fashioning” of
the appropriate remedy, once the plaintiff had succeeded in tracing his
property “whether in its original or in some changed form” into the hands of
the defendant, and overcome any defences:</a></p><a name="para125">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The plaintiff will generally be
entitled to a personal remedy; if he seeks a proprietary remedy he must usually
prove that the property to which he lays claim is still in the ownership of the
defendant. If he succeeds in doing this, the court will treat the defendant as
holding the property on a constructive trust for the plaintiff and will order
the defendant to transfer it in specie to the plaintiff. But this is only one
of the proprietary remedies which are available to a court of equity. If the
plaintiff’s money has been applied by the defendant, for example, not in the
acquisition of a landed property but in its improvement, then the court may
treat the land as charged with the payment to the plaintiff of a sum
representing the amount by which the value of the defendant’s land has been
enhanced by the use of the plaintiff’s money. <i>And if the plaintiff’s money
has been used to discharge a mortgage on the defendant's land, then the court
may achieve a similar result by treating the land as subject to a charge by way
of subrogation in favour of the plaintiff</i>.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The judge had not erred by invoking the two doctrines in
the same case:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“They arose at different stages of
the proceedings. Tracing was the process by which the Abbey National sought to
establish that <i>its money</i> was applied in the discharge of the Halifax’s
charge; subrogation was the remedy which it sought in order to deprive Mr Bajwa
(through whom the appellants claim) of the unjust enrichment which he would
thereby otherwise obtain at the Abbey National’s expense.” (p 334B-335F,
emphasis added)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para125"></a><a name="para126">126.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Millett LJ went on to discuss separately the principles of tracing and
subrogation, as applied to the instant case. In relation to the former (pp 335-337),
it had been argued that the right to trace was lost when the money advanced by
Abbey National went into Hill Lawson’s general client account, where it was
mixed with other money including other funds belonging to Mr Bajwa. It was held
in favour of Abbey National that, as against Hill Lawson and Mr Bajwa, who
though not wrongdoers were not “innocent volunteers”, they could rely on
equity’s ability to follow money through a mixed bank account “by treating the
money in the account as charged with the repayment of his money” (pp 336F,
337G).</a></p><a name="para126">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para126"></a><a name="para127">127.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the heading “Subrogation” (pp 338-339) the principal issue was
whether it mattered that Abbey National had failed to show an intention to
obtain the benefit of the Halifax security. As Millett LJ explained:</a></p><a name="para127">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para127">“In cases such as <i>Butler v Rice</i>
and <i>Ghana Commercial Bank v Chandiram</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1960/1960_20.html">[1960] AC 732</a>, where the claimant
paid the creditor direct and intended to discharge his security, the court took
the claimant’s intention to have been to keep the original security alive for
his own benefit save in so far as it was replaced by an effective security in
favour of himself. In the present case the Abbey National did not intend to
discharge the Halifax’s charge in the events which happened, that is to say, in
the event that completion did not proceed. But it did not intend its money to
be used at all in that event.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">However, that did not mean that the remedy was
unavailable:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the present case the payment
was made by Hill Lawson, and it is their intention which matters. As
fiduciaries, they could not be heard to say that they had paid out their
principal’s money otherwise than for the benefit of their principal.
Accordingly, their intention must be taken to have been to keep the Halifax’s
charge alive for the benefit of the Abbey National pending completion. In my
judgment this is sufficient to bring the doctrine of subrogation into play.” (p
339D-H)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para128">128.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These passages are of direct relevance to the arguments in the present
case, and in my view difficult to reconcile with the more flexible approach of
the Court of Appeal. It was clearly regarded by Millett LJ as necessary for the
claimants to establish that the money used to pay off the loan was<i> their</i>
money. “Tracing” was the process by which this was done. In the context of
subrogation, tracing was not about identifying a particular asset in the hands
of the defendant, as belonging notionally to the claimant; but rather as
providing the necessary link with the payments made to discharge the relevant
mortgage. In the passage quoted above, Millett LJ treated such payments as
analogous to money spent in improving property. It was not regarded by him as
sufficient to apply a broad causation or “economic reality” test, such as
applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. Had that been enough, the
detailed examination of equitable rules relevant to tracing the money in the
Hill Lawson account would have been unnecessary. It would have been enough that
“but for” the receipt of the money from Abbey National, the Halifax mortgage would
never have been paid off.</a></p><a name="para128">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This aspect of the case is not affected by the decision in <i>Banque
Financière</i>. Lord Hoffmann noted that there was no difficulty on the facts
of that case in “tracing” the bank’s money into the discharge of the relevant
debt, since by contrast with <i>Boscawen </i>the payment was direct (p 235C-D).
I take him to have been using that term in the same sense as Millett LJ<i>. </i>The
problem was not so much the right to a proprietary remedy but whether that
right should be cut down so as to limit its scope by reference to the limited
nature of the initial agreement. The decision itself, and in particular the
nature of the remedy (personal, proprietary or hybrid?), have been much
discussed (see <i>Goff &amp; Jones </i>para 6-30). But it throws no doubt on
the importance, in the present context, of establishing a tracing link between
the claimant’s own money and the payment used to discharge the security.</a></p><a name="para129">

<p class="ParaHeading">Academic discussion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para129"></a><a name="para130">130.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I should make brief reference to some of the academic discussion, if
only to note the lack of consensus on the issues before us. Indeed, there are
few more hotly debated issues among specialist academics in this field than the
scope of the remedies, personal or proprietary, for unjust enrichment. In Mitchell
and Watterson<i> </i>(<i>op cit</i>), there is an illuminating discussion of
the various strands of academic opinion as it stood at the time of that edition
(2007). I note in particular two sections, headed “Proprietary remedies for
unjust enrichment generally” (para 8.40ff) and “Proprietary subrogation” (para 8.46-7).
The former notes, for example, the view of some commentators that the English
law of unjust enrichment “should be purged of proprietary remedies altogether”
(para 8.41); contrasted with other “more accommodating” approaches, such as
that of Professor Andrew Burrows (<i>The</i> <i>Law of Restitution, </i>2nd ed (2002),
para 8.42) who accepts the need for special justification for a proprietary
remedy, but finds it in two factors, that the payment added to the value of the
defendant’s asset and that the claimant did not voluntarily assume the risk of
the defendant’s insolvency. Against that backdrop, it is said, the subrogation
authorities reveal “a surprising readiness” to award proprietary remedies.
Following <i>Banque Financière</i>, it is suggested that the courts should
“look across from the subrogation authorities” to develop a consistent view of
the circumstances in which proprietary restitutionary remedies should be
awarded (para 8.46-7).</a></p><a name="para130">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The clearest academic exposition in recent textbooks of the distinction
on which the appellants rely appears in the current edition of Goff &amp; Jones<i>,
The Law of Unjust Enrichment</i>, 8th ed (2011). Floyd LJ referred to para
6-01, relating to the term “at the claimant’s expense”, without noting that
this was in a chapter dealing specifically with “personal claims”. Chapter 7,
headed “At the Claimant’s Expense; Proprietary Claims” contains the following
important passage, which on its face appears to support the appellant’s case:</a></p><a name="para131">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Both personal and proprietary
claims are governed by the rule that the defendant’s enrichment must have been
gained at the claimant’s expense, but the tests used to determine whether this
requirement has been satisfied vary with the type of claim. Where the claimant
seeks a personal remedy, he must show that there was a transfer of value
between the parties, and this is tested by asking whether an event took place
that caused the claimant to become worse off and the defendant to become better
off. This is discussed in Chapter 6. In contrast, where the claimant seeks a
proprietary remedy, it is not enough for him to show that there was a transfer
of value between the parties: he must also show either that he previously owned
the property in which he now claims an ownership or security interest, or else
that the defendant acquired this property in exchange for property that was
previously owned by the claimant, or else that this property was formerly the
subject matter of an interest that was discharged with property that was
previously owned by the claimant. <i>This test is more stringent than the
causal test used in the context of personal claims, and it serves as a control
mechanism to prevent proprietary restitutionary remedies from becoming too
freely available</i>.” (para 7-02, emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The footnote refers to a list of cases cited later in the
chapter (para 7-39, fn 87) including “in the subrogation context” <i>Boscawen</i>
(at p 334).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para131"></a><a name="para132">132.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The application of those principles to the payment of debts is discussed
in more detail later in the chapter (para 7-42). The rule that “the tracing
process” comes to an end when “the value being traced is dissipated” applies
generally where the claimant’s money is used to pay off a debt. Subrogation is
cited as one exception to the rule:</a></p><a name="para132">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… if the debt was secured by a
charge over the defendant’s property then Equity can treat the debt and the charge,
by a legal fiction, as though they were not extinguished by the payment,
thereby enabling the beneficiaries to trace the value inherent in their money
into the value inherent in the creditor’s fictionally subsisting chose in
action against the defendant.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Again the reference is to <i>Boscawen. </i>Notable here
is the close link between subrogation and the doctrine of tracing, which as has
been seen was central to the analysis by Millett LJ in that case. There is no
apparent support for the Court of Appeal’s view that a sufficient link could be
found in a looser test based on economic reality or simple causation.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Is there a tracing link in this case?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para132"></a><a name="para133">133.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal felt able to decide the case on the footing that the
Bank did not have an interest in the money used to pay off the security. It
found it unnecessary to decide whether that assumption was correct. In this
court it has been submitted that it was not. It is argued that the Bank did
have a sufficient interest on the basis either of the principle in <i>Buhr v
Barclays Bank plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1223</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1223.html">[2002] BPIR 25</a>, or of a so-called <i>Quistclose
</i>trust (after <i>Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/4.html">[1970] AC 567</a>).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134">134.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the <i>Quistclose </i>principle does not appear in terms to
have been relied on in argument in the courts below, the substance was
sufficiently pleaded in the amended counterclaim (para 13), which asserts that
the proceeds of the sale of Rush Green Hall released by the defendant Bank were
-</a></p><a name="para134">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… held on trust for the defendant,
subject to a power for Mr and Mrs Menelaou to use the same to purchase a flat
in the joint names of Danielle Menelaou and her partner and also to purchase the
Property in the name of the claimant but only on condition that the outstanding
debts of Mr and Mrs Menelaou were to be secured by a first legal charge over
the Property.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The issue was also addressed by the judge (paras 14-17),
albeit not specifically by reference to the <i>Quistclose </i>principle. It
does not depend on any further findings of fact. I see no reason therefore why
it cannot properly be relied on by the Bank in this court.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134"></a><a name="para135">135.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <i>Quistclose </i>principle was explained and applied by the House
of Lords in <i>Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/12.html">[2002] 2 AC 164</a>. A solicitor (Sims)
had received money, lent by Twinsectra to his client (Mr Yardley) for the
purchase of a property, under an undertaking that it would be utilised solely
for the acquisition of property and for no other purpose. The money was paid to
the defendant solicitor (Mr Leach), acting on behalf of the same client; he
paid it out to the client who used it for purposes other than the purchase of
the property. A claim against the defendant solicitor for dishonest assistance
failed only because dishonesty was not established. The money was held to be
subject to a trust in the first solicitor’s client account, the terms of which
were found in the terms of the undertaking, which made clear that the money
“was not to be at the free disposal of [the client]”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the effect of the undertaking
was to provide that the money in the Sims client account should remain
Twinsectra’s money until such time as it was applied for the acquisition of
property in accordance with the undertaking. For example, if Mr Yardley went
bankrupt before the money had been so applied, it would not have formed part of
his estate, as it would have done if Sims had held it in trust for him
absolutely. The undertaking would have ensured that Twinsectra could get it
back. It follows that Sims held the money in <i>trust</i> for Twinsectra, but
subject to a <i>power</i> to apply it by way of loan to Mr Yardley in
accordance with the undertaking …” (paras 12-13, per Lord Hoffmann)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para136">136.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the critical issue is the status of the money
received by Boulters on 12 September 2008, as proceeds of the sale of Rush
Green Hall. (I do not understand either party to suggest that the deposit
£90,000 should be treated differently from the balance of £785,000.) The judge
saw no reason to infer a proprietary interest in the Bank:</a></p><a name="para136">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“16. In the present case the
agreement or understanding recorded in the Bank’s letter of 9 September 2008
did not address the question of ownership or even security rights in the sale
proceeds of Rush Green Hall, and had no reason to do so. While the arrival of
the sale proceeds from Rush Green Hall and the payment of £785,000 to the
vendors of Great Oak Court (or their solicitors) and of £750,000 to the Bank
could not have been literally simultaneous, it is unrealistic to suppose that
the parties were concerned with the status of the incoming monies in any short
interval between them. Critically, the agreement was concerned only with the
circumstances in which the charges over Rush Green Hall would be released. So
long as they remained in place, there was neither need nor reason for the Bank
to have any rights over the proceeds of sale, or thereafter, since the charges
were only to be released against substitute security over Great Oak Court. And
should there be a defect in that substitute security, the Bank had protected
itself by obtaining the undertakings given by Boulters in the Certificate of
Title.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para136"></a><a name="para137">137.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the judge, this analysis (like my own as trial judge in <i>Twinsectra</i>)
seems to me to start from the wrong end. In the Boulters client account the
money was undoubtedly trust money, in the sense that it was held beneficially
for their clients (see eg <i>In re A Solicitor </i>[1952] Ch 328). That is not
affected by the brevity of the period for which it was expected to be held. The
relevant questions are: for whose benefit was it so held and on what terms? By
this time they were acting for both the Menelaous and the Bank. Their
respective interests in the money depended on the arrangements between them and
with their solicitors. It is true that the Bank’s letter of 9 September 2008
said nothing in terms about an interest in the money to be used for the new
purchase. But there is nothing to suggest that the money was treated as freely
at the disposal of the Menelaous, which would have been inconsistent with the
general purpose of the arrangement.</a></p><a name="para137">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para137"></a><a name="para138">138.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The terms of the certificate of title provided to the Bank by Boulters
on 10 September are also relevant. In it Melissa was named as “borrower”, and
the price as £875,000. It included a standard form undertaking –</a></p><a name="para138">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“prior to use of the mortgage
advance, to obtain in the form required by you the execution of a mortgage and
a guarantee as appropriate by the persons whose identities have been checked in
accordance with paragraph (1) above as those of the Borrower, any other person
in whom the legal estate is vested and any guarantor ….”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para138"></a><a name="para139">139.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>They also undertook to notify the Bank of anything coming to their
attention before completion which would render the certificate untrue or inaccurate,
and if so to “defer completion pending your authority to proceed and … return
the mortgage advance to you if required …”. I agree with Mr Rainey that in its
context the reference in the certificate of title to the “mortgage advance”
must be read as a reference to the money received by them from the sale of Rush
Green Hall. The natural implication of the undertakings was that, if the sale
failed, the sum so defined would be paid to the Bank; not simply transferred to
the Menelaous.</a></p><a name="para139">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para139"></a><a name="para140">140.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows in my view that there is no difficulty in this case in
finding the necessary “tracing link” between the Bank and the money used to
purchase the new property. In this respect it is a much simpler case than <i>Boscawen</i>.<i>
</i>The Bank’s interest in the purchase money was clear and direct. On this
relatively narrow ground, I would hold that the appeal should be dismissed.</a></p><a name="para140">

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><b>LORD KERR AND LORD WILSON:</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para140"></a><a name="para141">141.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subject to the sentence which follows, we agree with the judgments both
of Lord Clarke and of Lord Neuberger. We consider, however, that it is
preferable to leave the availability of a personal claim against Melissa entirely
open and so to that extent we prefer the terms in which Lord Neuberger
expresses himself in paras 80-82 above to the marginally different terms in
which Lord Clarke expresses himself in para 55 above.</a></p><a name="para141">
