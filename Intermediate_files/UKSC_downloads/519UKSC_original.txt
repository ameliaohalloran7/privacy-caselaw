<p class="NewSpeech">LORD HODGE: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom Lady
Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Wilson and Lord Reed agree</span>)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is a challenge by application for judicial review to the legality
of the comprehensive ban on smoking at the State Hospital at Carstairs which
the State Hospitals Board for Scotland (“the Board”) adopted by a decision
taken at a meeting on 25 August 2011 and implemented on 5 December 2011. The
appellant, Mr McCann, does not challenge the ban on smoking indoors. His
challenge relates only to the ban on smoking in the grounds of the State
Hospital and on home visits, which, by creating a comprehensive ban, prevents
detained patients from smoking anywhere.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr McCann suffers from a mental disorder. After committing a number of
offences which were prosecuted on summary complaint, he was detained without
limit of time in the State Hospital under orders made originally under the
Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 (and more recently under the Criminal
Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”)) in December 1995. He remained
in detention in the State Hospital until March 2014. He was then transferred to
a medium secure unit in Glasgow, called the Rowanbank Clinic, where he remains
in the care of NHS Greater Glasgow (“NHSGG”). NHSGG has decided to introduce a
comprehensive smoking ban at the Rowanbank Clinic. Mr McCann has challenged
that decision in separate proceedings for judicial review but his application
remains sisted (stayed), pending the outcome of this appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr McCann raises three principal issues in his challenge. First, he
argues that the impugned decision is invalid at common law on the ground of
ultra vires because, when so deciding, it did not adhere to the principles laid
down in section 1 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003
(“the 2003 Act”) (which I set out in para 22 below) or comply with the
requirements of subordinate legislation made under the 2003 Act. Secondly, he
submits that the impugned decision was unlawful because it unjustifiably interfered
with his private life and thereby infringed his right to respect for his
private life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR”). Thirdly, founding on article 14 of ECHR in
combination with article 8, he argues that the Board, by implementing the
comprehensive smoking ban, has treated him in a discriminatory manner which
cannot be objectively justified when compared with (i) people detained in
prison, (ii) patients in other hospitals (whether detained or not) or (iii)
members of the public who remain at liberty.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After setting out the factual background and the relevant legislation
and summarising the proceedings in the courts below, I will address each
challenge in turn.</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="ParaHeading">The factual background</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For many years public authorities in Scotland and elsewhere in the
United Kingdom have sought to discourage smoking because of concerns about its
effects on the health of the smokers and of those exposed to second-hand smoke,
by so-called “passive smoking”. Section 4 of the Smoking, Health and Social
Care (Scotland) Act 2005 empowered the Scottish Ministers to make regulations
prescribing classes of premises in which smoking would be prohibited and also
the premises to be excluded from that ban. Among the premises which the
Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Premises (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (SSI
2006/90) prescribed as no smoking premises were hospitals, hospices,
psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric units and healthcare premises. Open areas,
such as hospital grounds, were not so specified. Among the premises exempted
from the smoking ban were designated rooms in psychiatric hospitals and
psychiatric units.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Over time, public authorities have sought to extend the smoking ban.
Between 2007 and 2011 the buildings at the State Hospital were redeveloped and
modernised. The business case for the redevelopment, which the Scottish
Government approved, proposed that the State Hospital would be a smoke-free
environment and that there would be no provision for smoking either indoors or
in the gardens and grounds. In accordance with that policy, the new buildings
contain no indoor smoking rooms or facilities which would allow patients to
take advantage of the exemption in the Regulations. The Board then had to
consider whether, and if so for how long, it would continue to allow smoking in
the grounds of the State Hospital.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The process by which the Board came to take the impugned decision is set
out in a document published by NHS Scotland in February 2012 called “<i>Working
towards a smoke-free environment: an account of the journey undertaken at the
State Hospital</i>”. Mr McCann founded on this document in his written
pleadings (statement 5) as the factual background to the impugned decision. In
summary, on 28 October 2010 the Board considered a report by its medical
director and resolved to work towards a comprehensive smoking ban with effect
from May 2011. After the judgment of the Court of Session in <i>L v Board of
State Hospital </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/scot/cases/ScotCS/2011/2011CSOH21.html">2011 SLT 233</a>, in which Lady Dorrian held that the Board had
failed to consult with patients (as it had conceded it was required to do by
section 1 of the 2003 Act) on its decision to ban visitors from bringing food
parcels into the State Hospital and to ban patients from ordering in food, the
Board reconsidered its policy concerning smoking at a meeting on 17 February
2011. It agreed to allow smoking to continue in the existing smoking rooms and
to conduct a consultation on the options of a partial or comprehensive smoking
ban.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Board conducted the consultation between 1 March and 31 May 2011. It
presented two options: a partial ban which permitted smoking only in designated
open air areas within the grounds or a complete ban both internally and within
the grounds. 86% of the patients who responded favoured the partial ban. The
Board met again on 23 June to consider a report on the consultation which
recommended that smoking be permitted in designated external areas in the
grounds. The Board accepted that proposal subject to further consideration of
how the partial ban would work in practice. The Board also confirmed its
commitment to working towards a smoke-free hospital. At a further meeting on 5
July 2011 the Board confirmed that position. Because the patients were soon to
move to the new building, the Board decided to close the smoking rooms in the
existing buildings and to prohibit smoking in the ward gardens as from 1 August
2011, leaving only the designated external areas for smoking. The Board agreed

</span>The Board conducted a further consultation in mid-August 2011 in which
it asked for responses to the same options of a partial ban or a comprehensive
ban. 64% of patients favoured a partial ban and 36% a comprehensive ban. The
Board’s chief executive prepared a report on the operation of the partial ban
which the Board considered at a meeting on 25 August 2011. At that meeting the
Board made the impugned decision to implement a comprehensive smoking ban in
December 2011.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>The minute of the meeting of the Board on 25 August 2011 recorded the
reasons for the decision in these terms:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[The Board’s Chief Executive]
outlined the activity following the Board’s decision and the considerable
problems experienced in operationalising the process, eg increasing numbers of
higher risk patients had been referred for consideration of grounds access. The
Senior Team had discussed a draft operational policy at their meeting on 27
July 2011 and agreed that from a practical point of view, patients would be
permitted to smoke in existing ward gardens at eight set points during each
day. The clinical team would agree the set points during each day.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Members were asked to consider:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feedback received
over the first month of the restrictions on the appendix received</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow smoking to
continue in the grounds, with further limitations, until 30 November 2011</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A full non-smoking
environment as of 1 December 2011</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Members noted that the decision
taken in June 2011 was to be reviewed in November 2011. The documented feedback
which had been received over the course of August 2011 from staff, as well as
smoking and non smoking patients was reviewed. The discussion that followed
centred around the difficulties encountered with the partial cessation of
smoking at the Hospital in relation to issues of safety and security,
operational and clinical disruption, time demands on staff, fairness of the
partial restrictions, and the inconsistencies around the set points in the day
when smoking was permitted. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">In light of the difficulties
discussed and the importance of the operational management’s view, Members
agreed that the partial cessation of smoking at the Hospital had proved to be
unworkable despite the best efforts of staff involved. It was agreed that the
State Hospital would be a full non-smoking environment as of 1 December 2011.
Support to patients in their smoking cessation attempts would continue and be
accelerated.”</p>

</span>The document, “Working towards a smoke-free environment …”, to which I
referred in para 7 above contains more details of the problems that became apparent
in August and September 2011. Patients tended to “power smoke” in the few
opportunities they had to smoke and some “reverted back to previous
institutionalised behaviour such as clock watching”. Staff who attended them
complained about daily exposure to passive smoking. The document also spoke of
significant operational and security risks. After the move to the new
buildings, concerns were expressed about patients congregating outside in
breach of grounds access rules.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>The impugned decision had several elements. It prohibited a detained
patient from smoking or possessing tobacco products in the State Hospital,
including in its grounds, and from smoking on home visits. It also prohibited
visitors from bringing tobacco products and tobacco-related products (such as
electronic cigarettes or lighters) into the hospital. Search and screening
procedures were established to search both patients and visitors for such
products. Tobacco products which the patients possessed on 1 December 2011 had
to be posted to an external address.</a></p><a name="para14">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The impugned decision was taken against the backdrop of a developing
policy of the Scottish Government to control the use of tobacco and to prevent
smoking at NHS facilities. The Scottish Ministers have continued to pursue that
policy. In March 2013 they published a document entitled “<i>Creating a
Tobacco-free Generation: A Tobacco Control Strategy for Scotland</i>”. In that
publication Ministers proposed (pp 26-27) (a) that mental health services
should make sure that indoor facilities were smoke-free by 2015 and (b) that
all NHS Boards would implement and enforce smoke-free hospital grounds by March
2015, by removing any designated smoking areas in NHS buildings or grounds.
Ministers excluded mental health facilities from the latter policy. But since
then some health boards have extended the comprehensive ban to such facilities.</a></p><a name="para15">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under section 102(1) of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978,
the Scottish Ministers are charged with the duty of providing “such hospitals
as appear to [them] to be necessary for persons subject to detention” under the
1995 Act or the 2003 Act, which hospitals are described in subsection (2) as
“state hospitals”. Under subsection (4) the Scottish Ministers are empowered to
provide for the management of a state hospital to be undertaken on their behalf
by among others a special health board. Under that provision the Board acts as
the delegate of the Scottish Ministers in managing the State Hospital. The
Board contends that, in deciding upon and implementing the comprehensive
smoking ban and measures to enforce that ban, it has acted solely under its
power of management in this section.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Until the enactment of the 2003 Act, the care and treatment of mental
health patients were governed by the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Over
time, concerns emerged that the legislation did not adequately protect the
rights of patients who were subjected to compulsory detention. One of the
factors which led to these concerns was the increased emphasis on personal
autonomy which resulted from the influence of the ECHR and the incorporation of
the ECHR in our domestic law, first by the Scotland Act 1998 and then by the
Human Rights Act 1998. In 1999 the Scottish Ministers commissioned a review of
mental health legislation by a committee under the chairmanship of the Rt Hon
Bruce Millan, who had formerly been the Secretary of State for Scotland.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In January 2001 the Scottish Ministers laid the report, <i>New
Directions: Report on the review of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984</i>,
before the Scottish Parliament. The report sought to promote greater awareness
of the need to respect human rights and the adoption of the least restrictive
alternative in the compulsion of mental health patients. It also sought to make
sure that any compulsory intervention was tailored to the particular needs and
circumstances of the individual (Introduction, paras 1 and 4). It recommended
that a new Act should be based on principles which were stated on the face of
the Act itself (Introduction, para 2; Chapter 3). This gave rise to section 1
of the 2003 Act, which I set out in para 22 below.</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In chapter 11 of the report the committee addressed, among other things,
the searching of patients, an issue which lies at the heart of the first ground
on this appeal. It observed that the 1984 Act contained no specific framework
for searches. The report (para 44) referred to the judgment of Potts J in <i>R
v Broadmoor Hospital Authority, Ex p S </i>The Times, 5 November 1997, in which
he held that a general power to conduct random searches must necessarily be
implied as part of the Broadmoor Hospital Authority’s duty to create and
maintain a safe and therapeutic environment. The committee recommended that a
Code of Practice should set out the parameters of search policies as it was
important that the rights of patients were clear in relation to this (para 46).</a></p><a name="para19">

Millan Committee. In its White Paper, <i>Renewing Mental Health Law - Policy Statement</i>,
the Executive accepted the committee’s recommendation as the framework for a
future Bill while modifying some of its recommendations in relation to
offenders with mental disorders. It accepted both the inclusion of a statement
of principles (p 5) and a Code of Practice to give guidance on the operation of
the new statutory powers, including the regulation of searches (p 69).</a></p><a name="para20">

what detained persons and visitors may have with them. The Policy Memorandum to

</span>The Scottish Ministers prepared regulations to give effect to section
286, which the Scottish Parliament approved by affirmative resolution: the
Mental Health (Safety and Security) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/464)
(“the 2005 Regulations”). In their consultation on the draft regulations in
2004 the Scottish Ministers explained (paras 54-55) that hospitals had policies
prohibiting certain articles and substances being brought into or retained in
hospital and on searching patients and visitors. The Ministers stated (para
56): “[t]he aim of these regulations is to put these policies on a firm
legislative footing, to ensure that there is proper recording and monitoring of
decisions to use powers to search patients or visitors and to prevent certain
substances and articles being brought into hospitals”.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>The 2005 Regulations (regulation 4) authorise measures such as the
placing of restrictions on the kind of things that specified persons may have
with them in hospitals and the removal from them of articles kept in breach of
those restrictions. Regulation 4 authorises similar restrictions on visitors,
and the search of both specified persons and visitors. Regulation 2 provides
that a person detained in, among others, the State Hospital and the Rowanbank
Clinic is a specified person if the hospital managers have (a) informed the
patient and his or her named person and the Mental Welfare Commission for
Scotland that he or she is a specified person and (b) informed the patient and
his or her named person that he or she is subject to the regulation 4 measures
and also that the specified person has a right of re-assessment under
regulation 5(b). Consistently with the philosophy of the least restrictive
alternative, regulation 5 sets out general conditions for the measures.
Condition (a) is that measures may only be applied to a specified person if the
person’s responsible medical officer (“RMO”) is of the opinion that “not to
apply them would pose a significant risk to the health, safety or welfare of
any person in the hospital or the security or good order of the hospital”.
Condition (b) requires the RMO to re-assess the risk mentioned in condition (a)
at the specified person’s request and empowers the RMO to reverse the decision
to apply the measure. Condition (c) requires that the reasons for and outcome
of applying a measure shall be recorded in the specified person’s medical
records and that the hospital managers make a separate record; and condition
(d) requires, as a general rule, that the named person shall be given notice of
the entry in the medical records. Regulations 6 and 10 set out specific
conditions for the searching of specified persons and visitors. Regulation 8,
which again is consistent with the philosophy of the least restrictive
alternative, imposes a condition that restrictions shall be placed on having
any article “so as to minimise the impact on the freedom of the specified
person compatible with the general condition in regulation 5(a)” (ie condition
(a) above).</a></p><a name="para25">

case (statement 15 of his petition) that the Board had failed to take account
of relevant factors, and in particular to apply the principles set out in

</span>Counsel presented their cases by referring to the documents for the
factual background. No affidavits were produced, no oral evidence was led and
accordingly no challenge was made to the contents of the documents in
cross-examination. As Mr McCann based his challenge on those documents, the
absence of other evidence is not surprising. The parties should have complied
with good practice by entering into a joint minute agreeing the documents and
dispensing with probation; but that was implicitly what they did. The Lord
Ordinary in his opinion narrated the events which the documents disclosed and
which gave rise to the impugned decision. In his interlocutor dated 27 August
2013 the Lord Ordinary declared that the impugned decision was unlawful so far
as it affected Mr McCann both because it was not taken in accordance with the
2003 Act principles and also because it breached his Convention rights under
articles 8 and 14 of the ECHR. The Lord Ordinary did not award damages but
ruled that the finding of the breach of those articles was “just satisfaction”
in terms of article 41 of the ECHR.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>The Board appealed that decision by a reclaiming motion which was heard
by the Second Division of the Inner House (the Lord Justice Clerk (Lord
Carloway), Lady Paton and Lord Brodie). The Board submitted that the 2003 Act
principles did not apply to the impugned decision, that Mr McCann’s article 8
right to respect for his private life was not engaged, or, if it was, the
impugned decision was a proportionate one which did not infringe his article 8
right. The Lord Justice Clerk gave the leading opinion, with which Lord Brodie
agreed, in which he allowed the appeal and refused the prayer of the petition.
He held that the Board was exercising its powers of management under the 1978
Act when it made the impugned decision. The 2003 Act was concerned with the
care and treatment of the individual patient and the impugned decision did not
involve the discharge of a function under that Act. Accordingly, the 2003 Act
principles had no application to the decision.</a></p><a name="para31">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the article 8 challenge, the Lord Justice Clerk referred
to the decision of the Strasbourg court (“the ECtHR”) in <i>Munjaz v United
Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1704.html">[2012] MHLR 351</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1704.html">[2012] ECHR 1704</a>, which (a) emphasised the
principle of personal autonomy in article 8, (b) ruled that detained persons
were presumed to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by
the ECHR, except the right to liberty, where the detention was lawfully imposed
in accordance with article 5 of the ECHR and (c) required any restriction of
those rights to be justified in each individual case. He sought to apply those
principles in this case. In agreement with the Divisional Court and the
majority of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case concerning the
statutory ban on smoking at Rampton Hospital, <i>R (N) v Secretary of State for
Health </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/1096.html">[2008] HRLR 42</a> and <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/795.html">[2009] HRLR 31</a> (also reported as <i>R (G) v Nottingham

Hospital case”), he held that a comprehensive smoking ban on persons detained
in an institution did not have a sufficiently adverse effect on a detainee’s
integrity and autonomy as to merit protection under article 8. He ruled (para
93) that the comprehensive smoking ban did not engage article 8. If article 8
were engaged, he held that the impugned decision was justified under article
8(2) as the comprehensive ban was proportionate to the legitimate aim of
promoting the health of both the detained patients and staff. On the same hypothesis,
he rejected the article 14 challenge (a) as prisons could not be compared with
the therapeutic environment of the State Hospital and (b) as the Scottish
Government was proposing to introduce a comprehensive prohibition against
smoking in all hospitals in the relatively short term.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lady Paton agreed with the opinion of the Lord Justice Clerk except in
one respect. She opined that article 8 was engaged. She drew support from Keene
LJ’s dissenting judgment in the Rampton Hospital case and expressed the view
that smoking was an addictive activity which was very much part of an
individual’s personal autonomy. But she agreed that the impugned decision was
justified under article 8(2) and that there had been no discrimination under
article 14.</a></p><a name="para33">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The impugned decision involves not only a comprehensive ban on smoking,
which extends to smoking in the grounds of the State Hospital and on visits to
a detained person’s home, but also a policy of searching both detained patients
and visitors for and confiscating tobacco. While the power to search for and
confiscate tobacco is a necessary component of the decision as it is the means
by which the comprehensive ban can be enforced, I am not persuaded that the
comprehensive ban itself falls within the scope of the 2003 Act. In my view the
Board is correct in its submission that the comprehensive ban, viewed on its
own, involves the exercise of a power of management under the 1978 Act. But,
for the reasons which I set out below, I have come to the view that the
supporting prohibition on possession of tobacco products and the power to
search for and confiscate such products fall within the scope of the 2003 Act
and the 2005 Regulations.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, I do not accept the submission that the 2003 Act is concerned
only with the treatment of individual patients and that it does not impinge on
more general management policies. That Act, which replaced the 1984 Act,
provides, among other things, for the detention of and the giving of care and treatment
to mental health patients. Many sections of the 2003 Act relate to the making
of such provision to the individual patient. But the discharge of functions
under the 2003 Act is not confined to individual care and treatment. In Part 18
of the Act (which is headed “Miscellaneous”) there are a series of sections
(sections 281-286) which provide either directly or through regulations for the
withholding of correspondence and the regulation of the use of telephones, as
well as for the functions with which this appeal is concerned, namely the
placing of restrictions on the kinds of things which specified persons may have
in a hospital, searches and confiscation. The regulations made in support of
those provisions, namely the 2005 Regulations to which I have referred in paras
24 and 25 above and also the Mental Health (Definition of Specified Person:
Correspondence) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/466) and the Mental
Health (Use of Telephones) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/468), are
subject to conditions (a) as a general rule that the detained patient, his or
her named person and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland are informed
that he or she is a specified person and (b) that the detained person is
informed of the restriction. Thus interested parties must be informed of
measures which affect individual patients, whether as a result of general
management policies or of individual targeting of patients. The relevant
regulations also require records to be kept of any decisions to search a specified
person and to prohibit or restrict the use of telephones by such a person.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While the further requirement in the 2005 Regulations (regulation 5(c))
to record a measure in an individual patient’s medical records may seem
unnecessary where a measure is of general application, that is not, in my view,
a sufficient indication of an intention to confine section 286 and the 2005
Regulations to individually targeted measures. The requirements in each of the sets
of regulations mentioned in para 35 above are consistent with the policy underlying
section 286 of the 2003 Act that the Scottish Government and the Mental Welfare
Commission should monitor the terms of policies for such measures and their
operation: para 21 above. I can see no rationale for excluding measures of
general application from this supervision, nor did counsel suggest any. I
recognise that some of the matters mentioned in section 1(3) of the 2003 Act
are not relevant to the discharge of these functions, especially when the
measures are not targeted at individual detained patients; but section 1(2) and
(9) provide for that.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the 2005 Regulations do not set limits on the things, the
possession of which may be prohibited or restricted, and for which specified
persons or visitors may be searched. Both the heading of section 286 of the
2003 Act and the title of the 2005 Regulations refer to safety and security,
but there is no provision in either the section or the 2005 Regulations which
confines the things to items such as weapons which might threaten the safety of
others. Section 286 also provides for the taking of samples from persons,
including swabs and blood (subsection (1)(b)) and the surveillance of specified
persons or visitors (subsection (1)(e)).</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, the focus of the section and the regulations made under it is
on the regulation of activities which impinge on the autonomy of individuals.
That focus on the detained patient’s autonomy is consistent with the Millan
report’s emphasis on the need to respect human rights. It manifests itself in
greater transparency by legislative provision for such policies, and through
the informing of interested parties of the regulated measures, the maintenance
of records of such measures, and the supervision by the Scottish government and
the Mental Welfare Commission.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The devising of policies and the carrying out of such measures have thus
become functions under the 2003 Act. The principles in section 1 of that Act
apply to such measures in so far as they are relevant. One principle which is clearly
relevant is the obligation in section 1(4) to discharge the function in the
manner that involves the minimum restriction on the freedom of the patient that
is necessary in the circumstances - an obligation to which the Code of Practice
draws attention.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Board did not purport to act under the 2003 Act in instituting the
policy of prohibiting the possession of tobacco products, searching for such
products and confiscating them. It may be the case that the consultation
exercises which the Board carried out during 2011 were sufficient to comply
with the obligations in section 1(2) and (3) of the 2003 Act. But there appears
to have been no consideration of the obligation under section 1(4) nor
compliance with the obligations to inform and record in the 2005 Regulations.
This is not surprising as the Board considered that it was acting under the
1978 Act.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a result, the prohibition on having tobacco products and the related
powers to search and confiscate are in my view illegal and fall to be annulled.
Although Mr McCann’s counsel argued that the component parts of the impugned
decision were not severable and counsel for the Board made no submissions to
the contrary, I would prefer to invite submissions on the form of order which
this court should make before making such an order.</a></p><a name="para41">

power to search patients in and visitors to the State Hospital for such

interfere with his article 8 right, and (b) for the reasons discussed above,
that they do not comply with the 2003 Act and thus cannot meet the requirement
of article 8(2) that they are “in accordance with the law”.</a></p><a name="para43">

</span>As it is likely that the problem of compliance with the 2003 Act is
remediable, I set out why, contrary to the view of the majority of the Second
Division, I have concluded that the comprehensive ban itself amounts to such
interference, which has therefore to be justified. I also set out my view as to
why, but for the problem of the domestic legal basis of part of the decision
(which I have discussed above), I consider that the impugned decision
(comprising both the comprehensive ban on smoking and the supportive measures
of the prohibition of possession and powers of search and confiscation) would
have been a proportionate response to the legitimate aim of the protection of
health, which is recognised in article 8(2), through its promotion and
safeguarding of the health of both patients and staff at the State Hospital.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>The scope of article 8</i>: I adopt as a general statement Lord
Bingham’s description of the purpose of article 8: “It is to protect the
individual against intrusion by agents of the state, unless for good reason,
into the private sphere within which individuals expect to be left alone to
conduct their personal affairs and live their personal lives as they choose”: <i>R
(Countryside Alliance) v Attorney General</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/52.html">[2008] AC 719</a>, para 10 (“<i>Countryside
Alliance</i>”). But it is notoriously difficult and may be impossible to
determine the boundaries of the personal sphere and thus of the article 8 right
to respect for private life. The ECtHR has identified values which the article
protects but has rejected the possibility or necessity of attempting an
exhaustive definition of the notion of private life: <i>Niemietz v Germany</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1992/80.html">(1992) 16 EHRR 97</a>, para 29. Judicial formulations of the values are inevitably
influenced by the facts of the particular case and, in particular, by the
nature of the state’s intervention - or failure to intervene - in the life of
the claimant. The House of Lords, when examining the boundaries of such values
in <i>Countryside Alliance</i> in the context of the hunting ban, expressed
differing and inconsistent views.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The concept encompasses securing a sphere within which an individual can
freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality and “to a
certain degree” the right to establish and develop relationships with other
people: <i>Brüggemann and Scheuten v Federal Republic of Germany </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1977/1.html">(1977) 3 EHRR 244</a> (the Human Rights Commission) paras 55-57. More recently, emphasis has
been placed on personal autonomy. Thus in <i>Pretty v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/427.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 1</a>, which concerned the statutory ban on assisted suicide, the ECtHR
summarised its jurisprudence (para 61):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]he concept of ‘private life’
is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the
physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can sometimes embrace
aspects of an individual’s physical and social identity. Elements such as, for
example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life
fall within the personal sphere protected by article 8. Article 8 also protects
a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop
relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Though no previous
case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained
in article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that the notion of personal
autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its
guarantees.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The ECtHR recognised that a person’s autonomy could
extend to the pursuit of activities which caused him or her harm. In para 62 it
stated:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The court would observe that the
ability to conduct one’s life in a manner of one’s own choosing may also
include the opportunity to pursue activities perceived to be of a physically or
morally harmful or dangerous nature for the individual concerned.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The idea of personal autonomy can also be seen in <i>von
Hannover v Germany</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 1, para 50 (in the context of press
intrusion into private life) and <i>Munjaz v United Kingdom </i>(above), para
78 (in the context of solitary confinement).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Also relevant to this appeal is the protection which article 8 gives to
the home as Mr McCann submits that as a result of his long term detention the
State Hospital had become his home. In article 8 “home” is an autonomous
concept. In <i>Giacomelli v Italy </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/916.html">(2007) 45 EHRR 38</a> (a case concerning
environmental pollution) the ECtHR stated that a home “will usually be the
place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops”. It
continued: “The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not
just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of
that area” (para 76). Similarly, in <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/43.html">[2004] 1 AC 983</a> Lord Hope cited the opinion of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice on the scope of
article 8 in <i>Marckx v Belgium </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/2.html">(1979) 2 EHRR 330</a> and stated (para 50):
“The emphasis is on the person’s home as a place where he is entitled to be
free from arbitrary interference by the public authorities”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This court is not bound by the judgments of the ECtHR; section 2 of the
Human Rights Act 1998 requires us to do no more than to take account of such
decisions. But in <i>Countryside Alliance </i>(above) the majority of the
speeches in the House of Lords appear to have accepted the relevance of the
concept of personal autonomy at least in certain contexts: Lord Bingham (para
10), Lord Hope (para 54), and Lord Brown (paras 138-139). The concept is also
consistent with Lady Hale’s identification of one of the values reflected in
article 8, being the inviolability of “the personal and psychological space
within which each individual develops his or her own sense of self and
relationships with other people” (para 116). She continued in the same paragraph
by stating that article 8 protected that private space but opined that “that
falls some way short of protecting everything they might want to do even in
that private space”. Lord Brown (para 139) expressed the wish that
jurisprudence would extend to encompass a broad philosophy of live and let
live, allowing people to engage in whatever pursuits they wish that were
central to their well-being unless there was a good and sufficient reason to
forbid them. But he also recognised that article 8 had not been interpreted as
going that far.</a></p><a name="para48">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So how should one apply article 8 to a detained patient in the State
Hospital? Does a detained patient such as Mr McCann have a private space, in
which his wish to smoke is protected? The majority of the Second Division held
he did not and reasoned as follows (paras 89-93). First, they said that a
detainee’s right to respect for private life extended only to protection
against interference beyond the concomitants of lawful detention. They then
considered that institutions such as the State Hospital would be unmanageable
without some restriction of the scope of the right to respect for private life
of detained persons “to that beyond the ordinary restrictions pursuant to
lawful detention”. Thirdly, they agreed with the majority of the Court of
Appeal in the Rampton Hospital case (para 32 above) that a comprehensive
smoking ban in such an institution did not have a sufficiently adverse effect
on a person’s physical or psychological integrity or his right to personal
development as to merit protection.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I respectfully disagree with the third stage of that analysis. Lawful
deprivation of liberty involving long term detention in an institution inevitably
curtails a detainee’s private sphere and constraints which are a necessary part
of the detention would not fall within the ambit of article 8. But it seems to
me that the degree of constraint which lawful detention imposes on the detained
patient’s private sphere works in the opposite direction from the third stage
of that analysis because it requires the court assiduously to uphold the right
to respect for what little remains of that sphere.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My starting point is the recognition in our domestic law that a person
who is compulsorily detained by the state enjoys all the civil rights which are
not taken away expressly or by implication as a result of that detention. The
House of Lords so held in the English case of <i>Raymond v Honey</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/8.html">[1983] 1 AC 1</a>, 10 per Lord Wilberforce, and both Lord Glennie and the First Division of
the Inner House have affirmed the same principle in Scots law: <i>Potter v
Scottish Prison Service</i> 2007 SLT 1019, para 25. The Grand Chamber of the
ECtHR has taken a similar approach in relation to fundamental rights in <i>Hirst
v United Kingdom (No 2) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/681.html">(2006) 42 EHRR 41</a>, in which it stated (para 69):
“prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms
guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty, where lawfully
imposed detention expressly falls within the scope of article 5 of the
Convention.” See also <i>Munjaz v United Kingdom</i> (above) para 79, in which
the Fourth Section repeated this analysis and added: “Any restriction on those
rights must be justified in each individual case”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The detained patient’s ability to conduct his or her life as he or she
chooses is inevitably severely curtailed by compulsory detention in the State
Hospital. For sound therapeutic reasons, many things which are available to a person
at liberty in his or her private home cannot be made available to a detained
patient. The circumstances of therapeutic detention may require the control of
things which the detained patient may possess, including things that might be
used as weapons against others or to self-harm; the possession and consumption
of alcohol may be prohibited; and many social activities, such as eating meals
in the company of other patients, may have to be conducted only under close
supervision. Routine and random searches may be an incident of therapeutic
detention and treatment: the Court of Appeal treated them as such in <i>R v
Broadmoor Hospital Authority, Ex p S </i>[1998] COD<i> </i>199. In these ways
and others, the loss of liberty entailed in therapeutic detention restricts the
scope of the private sphere and therefore the protections available under
article 8, as the Second Division held.</a></p><a name="para52">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, I agree with Lady Hale (in <i>Countryside Alliance </i>para
116) that article 8 does not protect everything that people may want to do in their
private space. But where therapeutic detention has severely curtailed a
detained patient’s private space in the institution in which he or she must
reside, the limited areas in which a patient has freedom of choice become all
the more precious to him or her and more readily form “a core part” of his or
her life, as Lord Rodger used the phrase in <i>Countryside Alliance</i> (paras
95-106).</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>L v Board of State Hospital </i>(above) Lady Dorrian stated (para
26) that for people detained in the State Hospital “the freedom to receive food
parcels from visitors and to make purchases from an external source are some of
the few areas in which they may exercise some sort of personal autonomy or
choice”. She concluded that article 8 was engaged by an interference with that
choice and that such interference had to be justified. Because restrictions on
food parcels and external purchases of food are not inherent in the loss of
liberty occasioned by therapeutic detention, I agree; and I see an analogy in
the comprehensive smoking ban.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not necessary to decide whether a comprehensive ban on smoking by
people at liberty, or at least a ban outside their homes, would so interfere
with their private lives as to require justification under article 8. Such
people can exercise personal autonomy in many other ways. But there is a need
to protect the residual autonomy of a person who has been subjected to long
term therapeutic detention by requiring this further intrusion into his private
life to be justified. In this regard I agree with Keene LJ in his dissenting
judgment in the Rampton Hospital case (para 101) and Lady Paton in this case
(para 106). I do not consider the addictive nature of smoking, which Lady Paton
emphasises, is a decisive factor, not least because it militates against the
person’s autonomy. But it may be said to reinforce the role that smoking can
play in some people’s lives.</a></p><a name="para55">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I also do not find it necessary to decide whether the State Hospital
falls to be treated as Mr McCann’s home for the purposes of article 8. If it
were, my analysis would essentially be the same as the one which I have adopted
based on the concept of personal autonomy.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I therefore conclude that a comprehensive ban on smoking is within the
ambit of article 8 of the ECHR, that it interferes with Mr McCann’s right to
respect for his private life and therefore that the Board must justify it.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Justification:</i> As is well known, justification under article 8(2)
requires that the measure which interferes with the right (i) is in accordance
with the law, (ii) pursues a legitimate objective, (iii) is rationally
connected to the legitimate objective and (iv) is proportionate. I have already
discussed the requirement that the interference be “in accordance with the law”
and have concluded that the part of the impugned decision relating to the
prohibition of possession, searches for and confiscation of tobacco products,
did not meet that requirement because of the failure of the Board to address
the requirements of section 1(4), and the regulations made under section 286,
of the 2003 Act. But because the Board may seek to introduce such measures in
accordance with the 2003 Act, I address the other tests.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I address first the tests of legitimate objective and rational
connection. In the Rampton Hospital case both the Divisional Court and the
Court of Appeal cited public documents which recorded (a) that in 1998 it was
estimated that smoking in the United Kingdom caused each year 46,500 deaths
from cancer and 40,300 deaths from circulatory diseases, (b) that those who
smoke regularly and then die of smoking-related disease lose on average 16
years from their life expectancy when compared with non-smokers and (c) that in
2005 second-hand smoking caused at least 12,000 deaths a year in the United
Kingdom. Having regard to the adverse effects that smoking can have on the
health of smokers and others exposed to tobacco smoke, I have no difficulty in
agreeing with the Second Division that the comprehensive smoking ban pursued
the legitimate aim of the protection of health which is recognised in article
8(2). The aim is to protect the detained patient from the health risks of his
smoking and other people from the health risks of second-hand smoke. The
comprehensive smoking ban clearly has a rational connection with the pursuit of
that desirable goal.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, in order to be “necessary in a democratic society” in the
interests of public health the interference must be proportionate. Again, as is
well known, the tests for proportionality (in addition to the tests of the
importance of the legitimate objective and the rational connection of the
measure to that objective) are (i) whether a less intrusive measure could have
been used without unacceptably compromising the achievement of the objective
and (ii) whether a fair balance has been struck between the rights of the
individual and the interests of the community having regard to (a) the severity
of the impact of the measure on the individual’s rights and (b) the
contribution of the measure to the achievement of the objective: <i>Bank Mellat
v HM Treasury (No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2014] AC 700</a>, para 20 per Lord Sumption, para 74 per
Lord Reed. No challenge is made to the ban on smoking indoors, where the danger
of exposing other patients and supervising staff in designated smoking areas is
obvious. The minute (para 12 above) and the document discussed in para 7 above
both record that the impugned decision which led to the comprehensive ban
resulted from the operational difficulties which the Board faced in operating
the partial ban which allowed supervised smoking within the hospital grounds.
Those problems threatened to compromise the health of the supervising staff,
the welfare of the patients and the security of both. Mr McCann did not
challenge the account of events in those documents, which, in my view, this
court must treat as the accepted factual background to the impugned decision.
Faced with such difficulties, I am satisfied that the Board did not act
disproportionately in imposing the comprehensive smoking ban when it did.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If there is to be a comprehensive smoking ban, it is likely that the
managers of the Board will need to prohibit the possession of tobacco products
and also have powers to search for and confiscate such products. As counsel for
Mr McCann does not dispute that the introduction of such measures in accordance
with the 2003 Act, the Code of Practice, and the 2005 Regulations would comply
with the ECHR, it is not necessary further to consider the justification of
those measures if they are introduced in that way.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, but for the illegality under our domestic law of the
prohibition of possession of tobacco products, the searches and the
confiscation of tobacco products which are part of the impugned decision, I
would have held that the decision was not contrary to Mr McCann’s article 8
right to respect for his private life.</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="ParaHeading">Article 14 of the ECHR</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Because the impugned decision fell within the ambit of article 8, it is
necessary to address briefly the challenge under article 14 of the ECHR that
the Board has treated Mr McCann in a discriminatory manner which cannot be
justified.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am satisfied that this challenge fails for three principal reasons.
First, the Scottish Government is committed to extending the ban on smoking to
all NHS facilities over time and also to extending the ban to prisons. As a
result, secondly, the differences in treatment between detained patients in the
State Hospital on the one hand and patients in other NHS facilities or
prisoners detained in prison are a matter of timing rather than policy. The
circumstances of individual public institutions will vary and each enjoys an
area of discretion on how and at what speed it implements its anti-smoking
policy. Thirdly, the explanation for the timing of the impugned decision is the
documented difficulties of the partial smoking ban in the State Hospital which
justified the introduction of the comprehensive smoking ban when it occurred. It
is therefore unnecessary to consider the differences between the circumstances
of Mr McCann on the one hand and the circumstances of these groups of people on
the other.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, I am not persuaded that there is any unjustified discrimination
when detained patients are compared with the general public at liberty. The
circumstances of such members of the public are radically different as (i) they
have opportunities to smoke in places which do not expose others to second-hand
smoke, and (ii) the public authorities do not have any legal duty of care to
create a safe therapeutic environment for them or to protect their own staff
from injury to health when they are in the public sphere and not acting in the
course of their employment. The documents to which I referred in paras 7 and 12
above reveal the problems of allowing smoking out of doors in a secure
hospital. Such problems do not occur among the general public. The differences
between the anti-smoking policies applied to them and the comprehensive ban in
the State Hospital can readily be justified.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may be that the effects of smoking on patients with certain mental
illnesses provide a further ground of distinction between mental health
patients and those with whom Mr McCann wishes to be compared. The Board
referred in its written case to the strong association between poor mental
health and smoking (which was also discussed in the evidential findings in the
Rampton Hospital case) and there was a suggestion in the documents which
suggested that smoking reduced the efficacy of clozapine, a drug for treating
schizophrenia. This was not explored in any detail in this appeal but I do not
need to rely on it in reaching my view.</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The article 14 challenge therefore fails.</a></p><a name="para67">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would allow the appeal but only to the extent that the prohibition on
having tobacco products and the search and confiscation regime in the impugned
decision are unlawful under our domestic law because they do not comply with
the 2003 Act and the 2005 Regulations (paras 40 and 41 above). In consequence,
the impugned decision infringes Mr McCann’s article 8 rights but only because
the decision is not in accordance with our domestic law (para 62 above). Otherwise
I would dismiss the appeal.</a></p><a name="para68">
