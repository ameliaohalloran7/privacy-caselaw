In preparation for the audit, on 1 November 2013 the auditors, KPMG, requested payroll data from Morrisons in order to test their accuracy. The head of Morrisons’ internal audit team delegated the task of collating and transmitting the data to Skelton. He had also performed that task in 2012. To enable him to carry out the task, he was given access to the payroll data relating to the whole of Morrisons’ workforce: around 126,000 employees.

On a date between then and 21 November, he transmitted the data to KPMG as he had been instructed to do. On 18 November, he surreptitiously copied the data from his work laptop on to a personal USB stick. On 8 December he used the username and date of birth of a fellow employee, Mr Andrew Kenyon, to create a false email account, in a deliberate attempt to frame him. Mr Kenyon had been involved in the disciplinary proceedings earlier that year. The email account was linked to the pay-as-you-go phone.

The file was created from the personal copy of the data which he had made on his USB stick on 18 November.

He purported to be a concerned member of the public who had found the file on the file-sharing website. The newspapers did not publish the data. Instead, one of them alerted Morrisons. Within a few hours, Morrisons had taken steps to ensure that the data was removed from the Internet, instigated internal investigations, and informed the police. It also informed its employees and undertook measures to protect their identities. Skelton was arrested a few days later. He was subsequently convicted of a number of offences and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. It was noted that Morrisons had spent more than £2.26m in dealing with the immediate aftermath of the disclosure. A significant element of that sum was spent on identity protection measures for its employees.</a></p><a name="para8">

The claims are also brought on the basis that Morrisons is vicariously liable for Skelton’s conduct. The particulars of claim do not specify the respects in which that conduct is alleged to have been wrongful on his part, but the claimants’ argument before the judge was that vicarious liability arose under the same three heads: breach of the DPA, misuse of private information and breach of confidence.

He rejected Morrisons’ argument that vicarious liability could not attach to a breach of the DPA by Skelton as the data controller of the data copied on to his USB stick and subsequently disclosed by him, holding that the object of Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“the Directive”), transposed by the DPA, was the protection of data subjects, and that if vicarious liability did not apply, the purpose of the Directive would be defeated. He also rejected Morrisons’ argument that the DPA excluded vicarious liability for misuse of private information or breach of confidence, holding that since the purpose of the Directive, and therefore of the DPA, was the protection of data subjects, it should be treated as providing additional protection rather than as replacing such protection as already existed under domestic law.</p>

That language was taken from the judgment of Lord Toulson in <i>Mohamud</i> (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/11.html">[2016] AC 677</a>, para 47). He added that Morrisons trusted Skelton to deal with confidential information, and took the risk that it might be wrong in placing that trust in him. His role in respect of the payroll data was to receive and store it, and to disclose it to “a third party”. That “in essence” was his task: the fact that he disclosed it to others than KPMG was not authorised, but was nonetheless “closely related” to what he was tasked to do. The five factors listed by Lord Phillips in <i>Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/56.html">[2012] UKSC 56</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/56.html">[2013] 2 AC 1</a>, para 35, were all present.

The motorist went into the sales kiosk and asked if some documents could be printed. The attendant, Mr Khan, refused the request and ordered the motorist to leave, using racist and threatening language, then followed the motorist back to his car, opened the door and ordered him never to come back, again using threatening language. When the motorist told Mr Khan to close the door, Mr Khan assaulted him. The judge dismissed a claim against the employer on the ground that Mr Khan’s actions were beyond the scope of his employment. An appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/116.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 116</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/116.html">[2014] 2 All ER 990</a>). The argument in the appeal to this court was that the test of vicarious liability should be broadened so as to turn, in the case of a tort committed by an employee, on whether a reasonable observer would have considered the employee to be acting in the capacity of a representative of the employer at the time of committing the tort. The court rejected that argument, holding that the established test remained good without need of further refinement. Applying the established test, however, the court allowed the appeal on the facts of the case.</p>

The Chief Justice had explained the doctrine as resting on the principle that, where an employer employed the wrongdoer, and the employee committed a wrongful act against the claimant within the area of the authority given to him, it was fairer that the employer should suffer for the wrongdoing than the person who was wronged.</a></p><a name="para19">

Even on its most elastic interpretation, the sexual abuse of children could not be described as a mode, albeit an improper mode, of caring for them. Lord Steyn (with whom Lord Hutton and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough agreed) said that it was not necessary to ask whether the acts of sexual abuse were modes of doing authorised acts. He posed the broader question whether the warden's torts were so closely connected with his employment that it would be just to hold his employers liable. He concluded that they were, stating at para 28 that “the sexual abuse was inextricably interwoven with the carrying out by the warden of his duties”. Lord Millett, in a passage in his speech which proved to be influential in later cases, suggested at para 69 that the Salmond formulation could be adapted “to impose vicarious liability where the unauthorised acts of the employee are so closely connected with acts which the employer has authorised that they may properly be regarded as being within the scope of his employment”.</p>

In a passage which is of particular importance, and which Lord Toulson cited in <i>Mohamud</i>, at para 41, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead (with whom Lord Slynn<i> </i>and Lord Hutton agreed) said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … it is a fact of life, and therefore to be expected by those who carry on businesses, that sometimes their agents may exceed the bounds of their authority or even defy express instructions. It is fair to allocate risk of losses thus arising to the businesses rather than leave those wronged with the sole remedy, of doubtful value, against the individual employee who committed the wrong. To this end, the law has given the concept of ‘ordinary course of employment’ an extended scope.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, then, authority is not the touchstone, what is? … Perhaps the best general answer is that the wrongful conduct must be so closely connected with acts the partner or employee was authorised to do that, for the purpose of the liability of the firm or the employer to third parties, the wrongful conduct <i>may fairly and properly be regarded</i> as done by the partner while acting in the ordinary course of the firm’s business or the employee’s employment. Lord Millett said as much in <i>Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd </i>…</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ‘close connection’ test focuses attention in the right direction. But it affords no guidance on the type or degree of connection which will normally be regarded as sufficiently close to prompt the legal conclusion that the risk of the wrongful act occurring, and any loss flowing from the wrongful act, should fall on the firm or employer rather than the third party who was wronged …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lack of precision is inevitable, given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue arises. The crucial feature or features, either producing or negativing vicarious liability, vary widely from one case or type of case to the next. Essentially the court makes an evaluative judgment in each case, having regard to all the circumstances and, importantly, having regard also to the assistance provided by previous court decisions.

In other words, as Lord Nicholls put it in <i>Dubai Aluminium</i> at para 23<i>, </i>it is necessary to identify the “acts the … employee was authorised to do”. Secondly, Lord Toulson said at para 45, “the court must decide whether there was sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice which goes back to Holt CJ”. That statement, expressly put in the simplest terms, was more fully stated by Lord Nicholls in <i>Dubai Aluminium </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/48.html">[2003] 2 AC 366</a>, para 23: in a case concerned with vicarious liability arising out of a relationship of employment,<i> </i>the court generally has to decide whether the wrongful conduct was so closely connected with acts the employee was authorised to do that, for the purposes of the liability of his employer, it may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the employee while acting in the ordinary course of his employment. That statement of the law, endorsed in <i>Mohamud</i> and in several other decisions at the highest level,<i> </i>is authoritative.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Toulson was not suggesting any departure from the approach adopted in <i>Lister </i>and <i>Dubai Aluminium</i>. His position was the exact opposite. Nor was he suggesting that all that was involved in determining whether an employer was vicariously liable was for the court to consider whether there was a temporal or causal connection between the employment and the wrongdoing, and whether it was right for the employer to be held liable as a matter of social justice. Plainly, the close connection test is not merely a question of timing or causation, and the passage which Lord Toulson cited from <i>Dubai Aluminium</i> makes it clear that vicarious liability for wrongdoing by an employee is not determined according to individual judges’ sense of social justice. It is decided by orthodox common law reasoning, generally based on the application to the case before the court of the principle set out by Lord Nicholls at para 23 of <i>Dubai Aluminium</i>, in the light of the guidance to be derived from decided cases. In some cases, the answer may be clear. In others, inevitably, a finer judgment will be called for.</a></p><a name="para26">

He began by identifying Mr Khan’s functions or field of activities (</a><a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/document/2011207517/casereport_49818/html"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/11.html">[2016] AC 677</a>, para 47):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the present case it was Mr Khan’s job to attend to customers and to respond to their inquiries. His conduct in answering the claimants request in a foul-mouthed way and ordering him to leave was inexcusable but within the ‘field of activities’ assigned to him.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Toulson then rejected the argument that the assault on the customer was unconnected with Mr Khan’s field of activities; an argument which had emphasised in particular the fact that Mr Khan had left the sales kiosk and followed the customer to his vehicle. In that regard, he said (ibid):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events. It was argued by the respondent and accepted by the judge that there ceased to be any significant connection between Mr Khan’s employment and his behaviour towards the claimant when he came out from behind the counter and followed the claimant onto the forecourt. I disagree for two reasons. First, I do not consider that it is right to regard him as having metaphorically taken off his uniform the moment he stepped from behind the counter. He was following up on what he had said to the claimant. It was a seamless episode. Secondly, when Mr Khan followed the claimant back to his car and opened the front passenger door, he again told the claimant in threatening words that he was never to come back to the petrol station. This was not something personal between them; it was an order to keep away from his employer’s premises, which he reinforced by violence. In giving such an order he was purporting to act about his employer’s business. It was a gross abuse of his position, but it was in connection with the business in which he was employed to serve customers.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read in context, Lord Toulson’s comments that there was “an unbroken sequence of events”, and that it was “a seamless episode”, were not directed towards the temporal or causal connection between the various events, but towards the capacity in which Mr Khan was acting when those events took place. Lord Toulson was explaining why, in his view, Mr Khan was acting throughout the entire episode in the course of his employment. When he followed the motorist out of the kiosk and on to the forecourt, he was following up on what he had said to the motorist in the kiosk. He ordered the motorist to keep away from his employer’s premises, and reinforced that order by committing the tort. In doing so, he was “purporting to act about his employer’s business”. As Lord Toulson said, “this was not something personal”.</a></p><a name="para28"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Toulson concluded his analysis of the facts by stating, at para 48:</a></p><a name="para29"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Mr Khan’s motive is irrelevant. It looks obvious that he was motivated by personal racism rather than a desire to benefit his employer’s business, but that is neither here nor there.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Read in isolation, the statement that “motive is irrelevant” would be misleading. Lord Toulson had just said, in the preceding paragraph, that one of his reasons for finding that there was a close connection was that Mr Khan was purporting to act about his employer’s business, and that his conduct towards the customer was not, therefore, “something personal”. So the question whether Mr Khan was acting, albeit wrongly, on his employer’s business, or was acting for personal reasons, was plainly important.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Lord Toulson said that Mr Khan’s motive was irrelevant, he was addressing a point which the judge had mentioned, namely that the reasons why Mr Khan had become violent were unclear. As just mentioned, Lord Toulson had already concluded that Mr Khan was going, albeit wrongly, about his employer’s business, rather than pursuing his private ends, and had treated that fact as supporting the existence of a close connection between his field of activities and the commission of the tort. Having reached that conclusion, the reason why Mr Khan had become so enraged as to assault the motorist could not make a material difference. That is all, I believe, that the remark that “Mr Khan’s motive is irrelevant” was intended to convey.</a></p><a name="para30"> 
<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">Vicarious liability in the present case</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows from the foregoing that the judge and the Court of Appeal misunderstood the principles governing vicarious liability in a number of relevant respects, of which the following were particularly important. First, the disclosure of the data on the Internet did not form part of Skelton’s functions or field of activities, in the sense in which those words were used by Lord Toulson: it was not an act which he was authorised to do, as Lord Nicholls put it. Secondly, the fact that the five factors listed by Lord Phillips in <i>Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society</i> </a><a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/document/2011203059/casereport_62592/html"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/56.html">[2013] 2 AC 1</a>, para 35, were all present was nothing to the point. Those factors were not concerned with the question whether the wrongdoing in question was so connected with the employment that vicarious liability ought to be imposed, but with the distinct question whether, in the case of wrongdoing committed by someone who was not an employee, the relationship between the wrongdoer and the defendant was sufficiently akin to employment as to be one to which the doctrine of vicarious liability should apply. Thirdly, although there was a close temporal link and an unbroken chain of causation linking the provision of the data to Skelton for the purpose of transmitting it to KPMG and his disclosing it on the Internet, a temporal or causal connection does not in itself satisfy the close connection test. Fourthly, the reason why Skelton acted wrongfully was not irrelevant: on the contrary, whether he was acting on his employer’s business or for purely personal reasons was highly material.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question whether Morrisons is vicariously liable for Skelton’s wrongdoing must therefore be considered afresh. Applying the general test laid down by Lord Nicholls in para 23 of <i>Dubai Aluminium</i> </a><a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/document/1991001211/casereport_7386/html"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/48.html">[2003] 2 AC 366</a>, the<i> </i>question is whether Skelton’s disclosure of the data was so closely connected with acts he was authorised to do that, for the purposes of the liability of his employer to third parties, his wrongful disclosure may fairly and properly be regarded as done by him while acting in the ordinary course of his employment.</p>

He performed that task on a date between 15 and 21 November 2013.

The courts below, however, treated it as important that Skelton’s disclosure of the data on the Internet was, as the judge said “closely related to what he was tasked to do” (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2339.html">[2019] QB 772</a>, para 186): a remark which the Court of Appeal described as “plainly correct” (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2339.html">[2019] QB 772</a>, para 63). The fallacy in that approach was explained by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Kooragang Investments Pty Ltd v Richardson &amp; Wrench Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_30.html">[1982] AC 462</a>, which concerned an employee who was authorised to carry out valuations, and negligently carried out a valuation without authority from his employers and not on their behalf. Lord Wilberforce rejected the argument that so long as the employee is doing acts of the same kind as those which it is within his authority to do, the employer is liable, and is not entitled to show that the employee had no authority to do them. He said at p 473:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the underlying principle remains that a servant, even while performing acts of the class which he was authorised, or employed, to do, may so clearly depart from the scope of his employment that his master will not be liable for his wrongful acts.”</p>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there does not appear to be any previous case in which it has been argued that an employer might be vicariously liable for wrongdoing which was designed specifically to harm the employer. The decided cases which are most closely comparable to the present case are those which have concerned vicarious liability for deliberate wrongdoing intended to inflict harm on a third party for personal reasons of the employee (leaving aside sexual abuse cases, where, as explained in para 23 above, a more tailored version of the close connection test is applied).</a></p><a name="para36">

The case concerned a police officer who left his post and went into a bar where his partner worked as a waitress and, in a fit of jealous rage at finding her there with another man, fired a number of shots at one or other or both of them with a service revolver to which he had access in the course of his duties. A bystander was injured and claimed damages from the Government. The contention that the Government was vicariously liable was rejected on the ground that since, at the relevant time, the officer had abandoned his post and embarked on a vendetta of his own, his wrongful use of the gun was not something done in the course of his employment.</p>

The connecting factors relied upon as satisfying the test were that the officer was a police officer on duty at the time of the shooting, that the place where the shooting occurred was within his jurisdiction, and that he had used a police revolver to which he was given access at the police station where he was posted and which he was permitted to use for police purposes: factors that created a connection between the wrongdoing and the acts which the officer was authorised to do which might be thought to bear a close analogy to those relied on in the present case (where Skelton committed the wrong using data to which he was given access at work and which he was permitted to use for an authorised purpose), and to be at least as strong. Those factors were held to be insufficient. Lord Nicholls explained at para 17:</a></p><a name="para40"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“From first to last, from deciding to leave the island of Jost Van Dyke to his use of the firearm in the bar of the Bath &amp; Turtle, Laurent’s activities had nothing whatever to do with any police duties, either actually or ostensibly.

He put aside his role as a police constable and, armed with the police revolver he had improperly taken, he embarked elsewhere on a personal vendetta of his own.

The customer became enraged at the manner in which he was spoken to by the attendant. After paying for the petrol, the customer saw a passing police car and drove off after it. He complained to the police officer about the attendant’s conduct and persuaded the officer to return with him to the petrol station. The officer listened to both men and indicated that he did not think that it was a police matter, whereupon the customer said that he would report the attendant to his employer.

The claimant in that case was an employee of a company run by its managing director. The managing director arranged for the company to pay for a staff Christmas party, and for accommodation and drinks for the staff at a hotel near the venue where the party was being held. At the hotel, the conversation turned to matters at work. The managing director became annoyed after being questioned about the appointment of a new employee. He summoned the employees who were at the hotel and began to lecture them on how he owned the company, that he was in charge and would do what he wanted to do, that the decisions were his to take and that he paid their wages. The claimant challenged a statement made by the managing director about the appointment. The managing director responded by telling him that he made the decisions in the company and assaulting him. The Court of Appeal held that there was a sufficiently close connection between the managing director’s authorised activities and his commission of the assault to justify the imposition of vicarious liability. His remit included the maintenance of his authority over the staff. At the time when he committed the assault, he was purporting to act as managing director, and was asserting his authority in front of members of staff, over a subordinate employee who had challenged his managerial decision-making.</p>

Notwithstanding that the assault occurred outside working hours and away from the workplace, there was clearly a very close connection between the managing director’s authorised activities as an employee and his commission of the assault: it was committed while he was purporting to act in the course of his employment as the managing director by asserting his authority over his subordinates in relation to a management decision which he had taken. Unlike the cases of <i>Hartwell </i>and <i>Warren</i>, this was not a case in which the employee was pursuing “a personal vendetta of his own” or “an act entirely of personal vengeance”.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span class="pages"><span style="background:whitesmoke"> </span></span>between “cases … where the employee was engaged, however misguidedly, in furthering his employer’s business, and cases where the employee is engaged solely in pursuing his own interests: on a ‘frolic of his own’, in the language of the time-honoured catch phrase.” In the present case, it is abundantly clear that Skelton was not engaged in furthering his employer’s business when he committed the wrongdoing in question. On the contrary, he was pursuing a personal vendetta, seeking vengeance for the disciplinary proceedings some months earlier. In those circumstances, applying the test laid down by Lord Nicholls in <i>Dubai Aluminium</i> in the light of the circumstances of the case and the relevant precedents, Skelton’s wrongful conduct was not so closely connected with acts which he was authorised to do that, for the purposes of Morrisons’ liability to third parties, it can fairly and properly be regarded<i> </i>as done by him while acting in the ordinary course of his employment.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the DPA excludes the imposition of vicarious liability for (a) statutory torts committed by an employee data controller under the DPA and (b) misuse of private information and breach of confidence</p>

Having concluded that the necessary conditions for the imposition of vicarious liability do not exist in this case, it is not strictly necessary for the court to go on to consider those issues. They have however been fully argued, and it is therefore desirable that the court should express its view.</a></p><a name="para48">

The Court of Appeal did not decide the issue concerning breaches of the DPA but agreed with the judge in relation to vicarious liability for breaches of common law or equitable obligations.</a></p><a name="para49">

It argued that the Directive was intended to achieve a harmonisation of national laws governing the processing of personal data, and that the existence of vicarious liability under English law, in circumstances falling within the scope of the Directive, was therefore precluded. However, in their oral submissions to the court, counsel for Morrisons departed from that argument in the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice in <i>Fashion ID GmbH &amp; Co KG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV (Facebook Ireland Ltd intervening) </i>(Case C-40/17) </a><a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/document/2019003772/casereport_f5935279-c91f-4bcf-9d29-38a962052651/html?query=%22fashion+id%22&amp;filter=&amp;fullSearchFields=&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date&amp;pageSize=50&amp;caseName=&amp;court=&amp;catchwords=&amp;judge=&amp;text=%22fashion%20id%22&amp;fromDate=&amp;sortOrder=date&amp;toDate=&amp;courts=&amp;publicationReference="><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2018/C4017_O.html">[2020] 1 WLR 969</a>.

The relevant principles were explained by Lord Nicholls in <i>Majrowski</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/34.html">[2007] 1 AC 224</a>, para 10:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The rationale [of the principle of vicarious liability] also holds good for a wrong comprising a breach of a statutory duty or prohibition which gives rise to civil liability, provided always the statute does not expressly or impliedly indicate otherwise. A precondition of vicarious liability is that the wrong must be committed by an employee in the course of his employment. A wrong is committed in the course of employment only if the conduct is so closely connected with acts the employee is authorised to do that, for the purposes of the liability of the employer to third parties, the wrongful conduct may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the employee while acting in the course of his employment: see <i>Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/22.html">[2002] 1 AC 215</a>, 245, para 69, per Lord Millett, and <i>Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/48.html">[2003] 2 AC 366</a>, 377, para 23. If this prerequisite is satisfied the policy reasons underlying the common law principle are as much applicable to equitable wrongs and breaches of statutory obligations as they are to common law torts.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Nicholls summarised the resultant position at para 17:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Unless the statute expressly or impliedly indicates otherwise, the principle of vicarious liability is applicable where an employee commits a breach of a statutory obligation sounding in damages while acting in the course of his employment.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Morrisons argued that the DPA impliedly excluded the vicarious liability of an employer. In that regard, counsel referred in particular to section 13 of the DPA. Subsection (1) provides that “[an] individual who suffers damage by reason of any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of this Act is entitled to compensation from the data controller for that damage”. Subsection (2) makes similar provision in relation to compensation for distress. Subsection (3) provides that “[i]n proceedings brought against a person by virtue of this section it is a defence to prove that he had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to comply with the requirement concerned.” The seventh data protection principle (Schedule 1, paragraph 10) also provides:</a></p><a name="para52"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The data controller must take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any employees of his who have access to personal data.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The DPA therefore made it clear, it was argued, that liability was to be imposed only on data controllers, and only where they had acted without reasonable care. That statutory scheme was inconsistent with the imposition of a strict liability on the employer of a data controller, whether for that person’s breach of the DPA or for his breach of duties arising at common law or in equity. Since it was common ground that Morrisons performed the obligations incumbent upon them as data controllers, and that Skelton was a data controller in his own right in relation to the data which he copied and disclosed, it followed that Morrisons could not be under a vicarious liability for his breach of the duties incumbent upon him.</a></p><a name="para53"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attractively though this argument was presented, it is not persuasive. The imposition of a statutory liability upon a data controller is not inconsistent with the imposition of a common law vicarious liability upon his employer, either for the breach of duties imposed by the DPA, or for breaches of duties arising under the common law or in equity. Since the DPA is silent about the position of a data controller’s employer, there cannot be any inconsistency between the two regimes. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that the statutory liability of a data controller under the DPA, including his liability for the conduct of his employee, is based on a lack of reasonable care, whereas vicarious liability is not based on fault. There is nothing anomalous about the contrast between the fault-based liability of the primary tortfeasor under the DPA and the strict vicarious liability of his employer. A similar contrast can often be drawn between the fault-based liability of an employee under the common law (for example, for negligence) and the strict vicarious liability of his employer, and is no more anomalous where the employee’s liability arises under statute than where it arises at common law.</a></p><a name="para54">

Morrisons cannot therefore be held liable for Skelton’s conduct. It follows that the appeal must be allowed.</a></p><a name="para56"> </a></div><a name="para56">
