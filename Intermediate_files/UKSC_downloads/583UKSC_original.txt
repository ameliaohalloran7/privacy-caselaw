<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Background</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal concerns the legality under the European Convention on Human
Rights of licensing conditions imposed by the Environment Agency (“the Agency”)
restricting certain forms of salmon-fishing in the Severn Estuary.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">Mr Mott’s interest</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, Mr Mott, has a leasehold interest in a so-called
“putcher rank” fishery at Lydney on the north bank of the Severn Estuary. A
putcher rank is an old fishing technique, involving the use of conical baskets
or “putchers” to trap adult salmon as they attempt to return from the open sea
to their river of origin to spawn. Mr Mott has operated the putcher rank under
successive leases since 1975. Since 1979, according to his evidence, it has
been his full-time occupation. He claims that, before the limits introduced by
the Agency in 2011, his average catch using the rank was some 600 salmon per
year, at a value of about £100 each, giving him a gross annual income in the
order of £60,000.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The right to operate the rank is derived from a “Certificate of
Privilege” dated 14 May 1866, issued by the Special Commissioners for English
Fisheries, and owned by the Lydney Park Estate. The current 20-year lease was
granted jointly to Mr Mott and a Mr David Merrett, and will expire on 31 March
2018. It gives them the right to fish two stop nets and 650 putchers, in return
for payment of an annual rent in two parts: a “fish rent” equivalent to 65
pounds in weight of salmon, and a “monetary rent” of (since the last review
date) £276. The tenants are required to operate the putcher rank during each
fishing season unless circumstances make it impossible. Further they may not assign,
let or part with the fishery during the term of the lease, save upon death or
disability, when they may with the written consent of the landlord assign to
another family member.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To operate the putcher rank Mr Mott has required an annual licence from
the Environment Agency (“the Agency”), under section 25 of the Salmon and
Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 (“the 1975 Act”). The salmon season runs from 1
June to 15 August. Licences are usually issued by the Agency in late April or
early May, shortly before the season opens. Until recently a licence for use of
“an historic installation” such as the putcher rank (unlike other methods of
fishing) could not be made subject to conditions limiting the number of fish
taken (“catch limitations”). However, with effect from 1 January 2011, the 1975
Act was amended to enable the Agency to impose such conditions where considered
“necessary … for the protection of any fishery” (paragraph 14A of Schedule 2 to
the 1975 Act, inserted by Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 section 217(7)).</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="ParaHeading">Measures to protect salmon stock</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has been government policy, as implemented by the Agency and its
predecessors, supported by government, that in the interests of effective
management “mixed stock fisheries” should be gradually phased out, and
exploitation limited, as far as possible, to places where the stock of salmon
is from a single river. The Agency considers that all the fisheries in the
Severn Estuary exploit a mixed salmon stock, with fish destined to return to
the rivers Severn, Wye, Usk, Rhymney, Taff and Ely and other rivers.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The rivers Wye and Usk are designated as Special Areas of Conservation
(“SAC”) under the European “Habitats Directive” (Council Directive 92/44/EEC),
transposed into domestic law by the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2017 (“the Habitats Regulations”). One of the main reasons for the
designation of these rivers is the need to conserve their salmon stocks. The
Severn Estuary itself is designated as a SAC, a Special Protection Area (under
the Council Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Council Directive
79/409/EEC)), and a Ramsar site. Together, these areas constitute the Severn
Estuary European Marine Site, for which salmon is a qualifying feature.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For some years the status of salmon stock in the Wye and Usk has been
categorised by the responsible authorities as “unfavourable” or “at risk”,
because of failure to achieve stock conservation targets or the objectives set
under the Habitats Directive.</a></p><a name="para7">

<p class="ParaHeading">Dealings between the Agency and the Tenants</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In late 2003, the Agency attempted to purchase the Certificate of
Privilege to operate the putcher rank. It agreed terms with the Estate, subject
to contract, and (as the Estate required) subject to agreement with the tenants
for termination of the lease. Negotiations between the Agency and the tenants
took place in 2004. By an agreement in 2004, the Agency paid the tenants
£30,000 compensation not to operate the putcher rank fishery during the 2004
fishing season. The agreement also provided a further payment of £10,000, if
agreement were reached before 1 June 2005 for permanent cessation. In the event
negotiations for permanent cessation were unsuccessful. It was agreed in
principle that compensation should be paid, but the parties failed to agree the
basis of valuation. During the 2005 to 2009 seasons the tenants continued to
operate the fishery. In 2010 an agreement was again reached for payment of
£30,000 compensation not to operate the fishery during that season.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In February 2011, the Agency offered to purchase the then remaining term
of the lease (seven years), but negotiations were unsuccessful. However, in
response to the application for a licence for the 2011 season, the Agency
agreed to pay the tenants £35,000 compensation not to operate the putcher rank
fishery during that season. Another historic installation fishery was also paid
not to seek a licence in the 2011 season. The only historic installation
fishery that was licensed in 2011 operated under the terms of a catch
condition, imposed under the new powers in paragraph 14A of Schedule 2 to the
1975 Act which had by then come into effect. The catch condition was determined
following an “appropriate assessment” under the Habitats Regulations (“the 2011
HRA”).</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="ParaHeading">The dispute</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The events leading to the present dispute began with a letter from the
Agency dated 16 April 2012, informing Mr Mott of a report by the University of
Exeter (“the Exeter Report”), which, it was said, provided clear evidence of
the mixed stock nature of the catch in the Severn Estuary. He was informed of
the intention to set a catch limit of 30 fish for that year, and of the power
under the amended 1975 Act to impose a catch limit without compensation. The
Exeter Report was followed in May 2012 by a Habitats Regulations Assessment
(“the 2012 HRA”) to the effect that unconstrained catches of salmon in the
estuary were threatening the integrity of the River Wye SAC, and that it was
necessary to limit the use of the historic installation fisheries. As HHJ
Cooke, sitting as a judge of the High Court noted (para 13), the contemporary
documents showed that the “controlling factor” was consideration of the numbers
of salmon returning to the Wye to spawn, the stock in that river being
considered to be the most vulnerable; and the impact of the claimant’s fishery
was considered therefore in terms of its potential effect on salmon destined to
spawn in the Wye.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>Mr Mott did not accept the Exeter Report’s findings. Having failed to
persuade its authors at a meeting in May 2012, he commissioned his own expert
report from a Professor Fewster of University of Auckland, New Zealand. The
disagreements between the experts were the subject of detailed study in the
courts below but are not relevant to the remaining issue in this appeal.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>In the meantime, Mr Mott was served with a notice under the 1975 Act on
1 June 2012, the first day of the new fishing season, limiting his catch to 30
fish. This figure was fixed “by reference to the lowest catch by any of the
historic installation fisheries that had sought a licence in the preceding
ten-year period”, with some increase to mitigate the risk of “reduction in
licence uptake and failure to maintain possible heritage”. A further reduction
to 23 salmon was proposed for 2013, and 24 for the 2014 season.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>The judge referred to a sentence in the Habitats Regulations Assessment
for 2013 which explained that under the new regime “the catch by the most
productive estuary fisheries will be restricted to the approximate long-term de
minimus (sic) catch.”: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/314.html">[2015] EWHC 314 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/314.html">[2016] Env LR 27</a> (para 31). He
commented on the effect on Mr Mott:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final sentence quoted
above was explained as meaning that the number of fish allowed per licence was
set as being approximately the ten year average catch of the least productive
of all the fisheries licensed. The practical result for the claimant is that
his fishery of 650 putchers is given the same catch allocation as the smallest
and least effective of the other putcher fisheries, which may operate 50
baskets or less. These he says are not commercially viable but operated only as
a hobby. Plainly, the heaviest impact of this policy falls on the claimant who
relies on the fishery for his living rather than the smaller operators.”</p>

</span>In the present judicial review proceedings Mr Mott challenged the
decisions of the Agency to impose conditions on the licences for 2012, 2013 and
2014, limiting catches respectively to 30, 23, and 24 salmon per season. He
alleged irrationality, and breach of his rights under the Convention. It was Mr
Mott’s case that the catch limit conditions have made the putcher rank fishery
wholly uneconomic and the lease worthless.</a></p><a name="para14">

</span>The judge upheld both claims and concluded that the decisions to impose
the catch conditions were irrational, as the Exeter Report did not provide a
reasonable basis for the view that the putcher installations were having a
material effect on the salmon fishery in the river Wye. He held further that
the Agency could not under Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR (“A1P1”)
properly have imposed the conditions, if otherwise lawful, without payment of
compensation.</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>The general principles governing the interpretation of A1P1 are well
established in European and domestic authorities. In<i> Back v Finland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2004/360.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 48</a> the Strasbourg court explained that it comprises “three distinct
rules”: the first (in the first sentence of para 52) is “of a general nature
and enunciates the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property”; the second (in
the second sentence of the same paragraph) covers “deprivation of possessions
and makes it subject to certain conditions”; the third (in the second
paragraph) concerns the right of the state to “control the use of property in
accordance with the general interest”. The court added:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The three rules are not
‘distinct’ in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are
concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful
enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the
general principle enunciated in the first rule. Each of the two forms of
interference defined must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a
legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be
realised.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The principles were summarised by Lord Reed in <i>AXA

</span>The application of A1P1, in circumstances comparable in some respects to
the present, was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Trailer and Marina
(Leven) Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1580.html">[2005] 1 WLR 1267</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1580.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 1580</a>. The claimant company owned a stretch
of canal designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (“SSSI”) under the
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”). The company entered into a
management agreement with English Nature, under which it agreed not to develop
fishing and boating activities in return for annual compensation of £19,000.
The agreement expired at the end of 2000. In January 2001, amendments to the
1981 Act (under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000), imposed a new
regulatory regime under which compensation was no longer payable. The company
claimed that the amended legislation involved a breach of their rights under
A1P1, and sought a declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act
1998. The claim failed.</p>

</span>Neuberger LJ, giving the judgment of the court, reviewed the authorities
dealing with the distinction between the taking or deprivation of property and
mere control of use. As he noted, the former normally requires payment of
compensation to avoid a breach of the article; the latter does not, even if the
control result in serious financial loss. He noted that the division drawn by
the Strasbourg jurisprudence is not clear-cut. He referred in particular to the
Grand Chamber decision in <i>Sporrong &amp; Lönnroth v Sweden</i> (1982) 5 EHRR
85, for the propositions, first, that under the second rule the court may need
to “investigate the realities” of the situation complained of to determine
whether it amounts to “de facto expropriation” and thus deprivation (para 63);
and that even where the interference does not fall clearly within the ambit of
either the second or third rule, it may be necessary to consider the
application of the first more general rule, and for that purpose to determine -</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… whether a fair balance was

</span>On the facts of <i>Trailer &amp; Marina</i>, the court held:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We accept, of course, that the
consequence of the amendments effected by the 2000 Act must have been to
diminish, sometimes substantially, the scope of the uses to which an SSSI could
be put, and accordingly to reduce, sometimes substantially, the income which
could be obtained from activities on an SSSI, and consequently its market
value. It can fairly be said that, in those circumstances, the public benefit
enjoyed as a result of the amendments effected by the 2000 Act will, in the
absence of any compensation provisions, have been at the expense of the owners
and occupiers of SSSIs. However, given the purpose and genesis of the
legislation, and the jurisprudence of the [ECtHR], that cannot of itself
justify an argument that there has been an infringement of the Article 1 of the
first Protocol rights of the owner of an SSSI whose value has been
substantially diminished as a result of the amendments effected by the 2000
Act.” (para 65)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As Neuberger LJ noted, the challenge was directed to the
compatibility of the legislation with the Convention. It had not been argued
that the restrictions in the particular case amounted to de facto
expropriation, or a disproportionate burden on the owner of the land concerned
(para 68).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An authoritative summary of the principles is found in the Grand Chamber
decision in <i>Hutten-Czapska v Poland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/628.html">(2007) 45 EHRR 4</a>, para 167:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Not only must an interference
with the right of property pursue, on the facts as well as in principle, a
‘legitimate aim’ in the ‘general interest’, but there must also be a reasonable
relation of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be
realised by any measures applied by the state, including measures designed to
control the use of the individual’s property. That requirement is expressed by
the notion of a ‘fair balance’ that must be struck between the demands of the
general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the
individual’s fundamental rights.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The concern to achieve this
balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 as a whole.

therefore ascertain whether by reason of the state’s interference the person
concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden …”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The judgments below</b></p>

</span>In the present case, the judge distinguished the <i>Trailer and Marina</i>
case, as a challenge to the legislation as a whole, rather than a particular
executive decision made under it. Thus the question of infringement of A1P1 had
had to be considered in principle, and not in relation to the specific
circumstances of the claimant. The court had recognised that there were powers
available to compensate an owner in an “extreme case”. The decision did not
therefore support a conclusion that any restriction on property on
environmental grounds can be made without a requirement for compensation (para
93).</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>His own conclusion that there was no reasonable basis for the
restrictions inevitably meant that the restrictions were not proportionate,
however categorised. However, he went on to consider the position apart from
that finding:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment this case,
like that in <i>Back v Finland</i>, has elements both of deprivation and of
control. The claimant’s right is largely but not entirely extinguished. It
could be exploited and would presumably have some small value if sold for
leisure interest rather than commercial use. It should be considered under the
general statement of principle with which A1P1 commences. Given the extent of the
restriction imposed, which eliminated at least 95% of the benefit of the right,
it is to be considered as closer to deprivation than mere control, and that
balance is relevant when considering the proportionality of the measure
challenged.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In adopting the measure
decided on, there is no evidence that the Agency considered the extent of the
effect on the claimant and his livelihood in any meaningful way at all. Though
the HRAs refer to the desirability of permitting the continuation of historic
fishing methods to an extent described as ‘residual’ they did not address what
the consequences would be for the rights holders affected at all, looking no
further than their own statement of the conservation objective.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is thus no
evidence that any balanced consideration took place at all. It would have been
relevant to that consideration that the claimant’s rights were of a commercial
nature, so that by making them uneconomic to exercise he was being deprived of
his livelihood and not merely of a pleasurable leisure activity or the
opportunity to maintain an ancient tradition. So far as the claimant is
concerned the position is exacerbated because the method chosen of levelling
all permitted catches down to the previous lowest meant that by far the
greatest impact fell on him whereas others who may only have used their rights
for leisure or hobby purposes would be less affected, and possibly scarcely
affected at all.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment, the
effect is that even if the Agency could properly have imposed the total catch
limit that it did, the size of that limit and the way in which it was
apportioned would still have meant that the claimant has been required to
shoulder an excessive and disproportionate burden, such that a breach of A1P1
could only be prevented by payment of compensation.”</p>

</span>It is to be noted (in particular from para 96) that the judge did not
feel able, or find it necessary, to categorise the action under A1P1 as either
deprivation (second rule) or control (first rule). He considered it under the
first general rule, as identified in <i>Back v Finland</i>, while regarding it
as closer to deprivation for the purpose of the proportionality balance.</a></p><a name="para25">

</span>In the Court of Appeal Beatson LJ agreed with this assessment. It is
unnecessary to set out his reasoning, which in substance followed that of the
judge (paras 87-89). It was sufficient in any event that the court found no
error in the judge’s reasoning, without needing to conduct their own
independent assessment of proportionality (see <i>In re B (A Child) (Care

</span>The issues identified by the parties as arising in the appeal are in
short (i) whether the conditions imposed by the Agency amounted to control or
de facto expropriation under A1P1? (ii) if the former, did the “fair balance”

</span>Mr Maurici QC for the Agency submitted that the restrictions clearly
constituted a control, rather than expropriation, in spite of the adverse
effects on Mr Mott. He referred for example to <i>Mellacher v Austria</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1989/25.html">(1990) 12 EHRR 391</a> concerning a new Austrian Rent Act which had the effect of
greatly reducing the rents to which certain landlords were entitled under
existing tenancy agreements. The court held that there had been no de facto
expropriation of their property, since they retained the right to use it even
if they had been deprived of a large part of their income. Indeed the only
example in the decided cases of de facto expropriation was the exceptional case
of <i>Papamichalopoulos v Greece</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/28.html">(1993) 16 EHRR 440</a>, in which the
applicants were owners of a large area of valuable land in Greece, of which the
military dictatorship had assumed control and transferred to the Navy to build
a naval base and holiday resort for officers. Although the land was not
formally expropriated, the applicants had been deprived of the entirety of the
use and value of the land in question.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to whether a fair balance had been drawn, Mr Maurici drew attention
to the emphasis given by European and domestic law to the protection of the
environment, and the important responsibilities imposed on the Agency in that
regard. The responsibility was particularly strict in respect of sites
designated under the Habitats Directive (citing <i>Sweetman v An Bord Pleanála
(Galway County Council intervening) </i>(Case C-258/11)<i> </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C25811.html">[2014] PTSR 1092</a>,
paras 40-41). He submitted further that it would be contrary to public policy,
and inconsistent with the “polluter pays” principle, for public funds to be
used to pay compensation to individuals such as Mr Mott, whose activities were
found to have caused environmental damage.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As an example of the emphasis given to the environment in the Strasbourg
case law, he cited <i>Hamer v Belgium</i> (2008) (Application No 21861/03), </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/1909.html">[2008] ECHR 1909</a>. The
court under A1P1 upheld an order for the demolition of a house in a woodland
area, which was unpermitted, but had existed as a holiday home for 37 years
with the full knowledge of the authorities. The court held that the order was a
control, rather than expropriation; and that it struck a fair balance, having
regard to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by authorities in the field
of environmental protection:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“... The environment is a cause
whose defence arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and
consequently the public authorities. Financial imperatives and even certain
fundamental rights, such as ownership, should not be afforded priority over
environmental protection considerations, in particular where the state has
legislated in this regard. The public authorities therefore assume a
responsibility which should in practice result in their intervention at the
appropriate time in order to ensure that the statutory provisions enacted with
the purpose of protecting the environment are not entirely ineffective.” (para
79)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For Mr Mott, Mr Hockman QC supported the reasoning of the courts below.
He submitted that the effect of the conditions was to nullify the practical use
of Mr Mott’s lease, and thus amounted to expropriation. But even if they were
regarded as a control, the courts below were entitled to find that they
required Mr Mott to shoulder an excessive and disproportionate burden, such
that breach of A1P1 could only be prevented by payment of compensation. It was
accepted that the Agency had power to pay compensation, and it had done so in
the past. The 1975 Act itself (even following the amendments made by the 2009
Act), recognised that compensation might be necessary in certain cases. Thus,
section 26 dealing with limitation of licences for fishing with nets provides
that where an order under the section would prevent a person from fishing “in
circumstances where that person is wholly dependent on the fishing for his
livelihood”, the Agency “may pay that person such amount by way of compensation
as it considers appropriate”.</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>The Strasbourg cases show that the distinction between expropriation and
control is neither clear-cut, nor crucial to the analysis. Viewed from the
Agency’s point of view, and that of the public, the restrictions imposed in the
present case were (as found by the Court of Appeal) a proper exercise of the
Agency’s powers to control fishing activity in the interests of the protection of
the environment. We were not referred to any case in which such action has been
treated as amounting to expropriation merely because of the extreme effects on
particular individuals or their businesses. However, it was still necessary to
consider whether the effect on the particular claimant was excessive and
disproportionate.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>Mr Maurici is right to emphasise the special importance to be attached
to the protection of the environment. However, this does not detract from the
need to draw a “fair balance”, nor from the potential relevance of compensation
in that context. As Mr Hockman pointed out, the potential need for compensation
is recognised in other parts of the 1975 Act itself.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Compensation played a part in a Strasbourg case close to the present on
the facts. <i>Posti v Finland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/634.html">(2003) 37 EHRR 6</a> concerned a claim by two
fishermen who operated under leases granted by the Finnish state. They
complained that restrictions imposed by the government to safeguard fish stocks
had failed to strike a fair balance under A1P1. The court held that the fishing
restrictions were a control, rather than deprivation of property, and that the
interference was justified and proportionate; the interference “did not completely
extinguish the applicants’ right to fish salmon and saltwater trout in the
relevant waters”, and they had received compensation for losses suffered (para
77).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By contrast in <i>Pindstrup Mosebrug A/S v Denmark</i> (2008) (Application
No 34943/06), </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/1660.html">[2008] ECHR 1660</a>, absence of compensation did not prevent the court ruling
inadmissible a claim in respect of restrictions on the commercial exploitation
of a peat bog, regarded as geologically and biologically unique. The court
upheld the assessment of the domestic courts that the effect on the claimants
was not unduly severe, having regard to the findings that they had not invested
in production facilities for the purpose of exercising their extraction rights
at the bog and that they had access to the extraction of considerable amounts
of peat elsewhere.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against that background I am unable to fault the judge’s analysis of the
applicable legal principles in this case. As already noted, he did not find it
necessary to categorise the measure as either expropriation or control. It was
enough that it “eliminated at least 95% of the benefit of the right”, thus
making it “closer to deprivation than mere control”. This was clearly relevant
to the “fair balance”. Yet the Agency had given no consideration to the
particular impact on his livelihood. The impact was exacerbated because the
method chosen meant that by far the greatest impact fell on him, as compared to
others whose use may have been only for leisure purposes. Indeed the judge
might have gone further. He thought that the lease might have retained “some small
value” if sold for leisure rather than commercial use. However, as Mr Hockman
pointed out, even that is doubtful given the strict limits in the lease on the
power to assign.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore uphold the decision of the courts below. In doing so,
I would emphasise that this was an exceptional case on the facts, because of
the severity and the disproportion (as compared to others) of the impact on Mr
Mott. As the Strasbourg cases show, the national authorities have a wide margin
of discretion in the imposition of necessary environmental controls, and A1P1
gives no general expectation of compensation for adverse effects. Furthermore,
where (unlike this case) the authorities have given proper consideration to the
issues of fair balance, the courts should give weight to their assessment.</a></p><a name="para37">
