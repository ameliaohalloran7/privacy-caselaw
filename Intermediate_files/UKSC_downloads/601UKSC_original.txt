</span>This appeal raises a short question on the operation by the respondent
Commissioners (“HMRC”) of the Construction Industry Scheme under the Finance
Act 2004 (“the Act”). The appellant company (“the company”) was registered for
gross payment under the scheme. As is now accepted, it failed to comply with
the requirements of the scheme without reasonable excuse. In consequence, on 30
May 2011, HMRC exercised their power under the Act to revoke its registration.
In doing so, they took no account of the likely effect of their action on the
company’s business. The company contends that this represented a failure to
take account of a material consideration, in breach of both domestic public
law, and of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”).</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">Factual background</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts are set out in detail in the judgment of Henderson LJ in the
Court of Appeal: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/1160.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 1160</a>. A summary is sufficient for present
purposes. The company is a family-run business of water well engineers, started
in 1972. In 2011 it had about 25 employees, and an annual turnover of about
£4.4m, much of it derived from contracts with a small number of major
customers.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was first registered for gross payment in about 1984, and its
registration was regularly reviewed thereafter. It first failed a review in
July 2009, when its registration was cancelled, and the same occurred in June
the following year; but on both occasions the registration was reinstated by
HMRC following an appeal. Between August 2010 and March 2011 the company was
late in making PAYE payments on seven occasions, the delays being generally of
a few days, but on one occasion of at least 118 days. This led to a further
review and to the cancellation which is the subject of the present proceedings.
The company’s appeal succeeded before the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) ( </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKFTT/TC/2012/TC02316.html">[2012] UKFTT 639 (TC)</a> ), but that decision was not upheld by the Upper Tribunal ( <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2015/392.html">[2015] UKUT 392 (TCC)</a> ) or the Court of Appeal ( <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/1160.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 1160</a> ). It now appeals
to this court with permission given by the court itself. By section 67(5) of
the Act, the cancellation does not take effect until the final determination of
the appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The FTT accepted the company’s evidence that major customers would be
likely to withdraw work if it lost its gross payment status. It found that at
the time of HMRC’s decision cancellation would have been likely to lead to the
loss of around 60% of the company’s turnover, and the dismissal of about 80% of
its employees, and that recovery would be expected to take about ten years. The
FTT also recorded that in July 2011 significant changes were made to the
company’s PAYE systems, with the result that payments thereafter were always
made on time. We have no information as to what has happened to the business in
the period since 2011, nor as to the likely effect of the loss of its status if
this appeal fails, and the cancellation now takes effect. In that event, the
company would not be able to re-apply for one year after the cancellation takes
effect: section 66(8).</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>As Henderson LJ noted, the overall structure and purpose of the
legislation has remained broadly the same since the inception of the statutory
scheme some 45 years ago. He cited Ferris J’s description of the background in <i>Shaw
v Vicky Construction Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2002/2659.html">[2002] EWHC 2659 (Ch)</a>; [2002] STC 1544:</p>

margin-left:72.0pt">“3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of the statutory provision with
which this appeal is concerned Vicky would be entitled, like any other
sub-contractor, to be paid the contract price in accordance with its contract
with the contractor without any deduction in respect of its own tax liability.
However it became notorious that many sub-contractors engaged in the
construction industry ‘disappeared’ without settling their tax liabilities,
with a consequential loss of revenue to the exchequer.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to remedy this
abuse Parliament has enacted legislation, which goes back to the early 1970s,
under which a contractor is obliged, except in the case of a sub-contractor who
holds a relevant certificate, to deduct and pay over to the Revenue a
proportion of all payments made to the sub-contractor in respect of the labour
content of any sub-contract. The amount so deducted and paid over is, in due
course, allowed as a credit against the sub-contractor's liability to the
Revenue …”</p>

</span>The relevant provisions in the present case are contained in the Finance
Act 2004, Part 3 Chapter 3 “Construction Industry Scheme”. The main operative
provisions are section 61, which provides for deductions on account of tax from
“contract payments” as defined; and section 60 which excludes from the
definition payments made to a person registered for gross payment when the
payment is made. Registration of sub-contractors is governed by sections 63 and
64. Section 63 provides that if HMRC are satisfied that the relevant
requirements of sections 63 and 64 are satisfied in respect of a company, it <i>must</i>
be registered for gross payment; but, if not, it <i>must</i> be registered for
payment under deduction. Henderson LJ rightly observed (para 23) that the
registration provisions are “highly prescriptive”, HMRC having no discretion at
this stage; and that payment under deduction is the “default position”.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The detailed requirements for registration of a company are set out in
Part 3 of Schedule 11. Again these requirements were rightly described by
Henderson LJ as “highly prescriptive” (paras 27-28). Relevant in the present
case is para 12 which sets out “The compliance test”. This generally requires
the company to have complied, in the “qualifying period” of 12 months preceding
the application, with all obligations imposed on it under the Tax Acts or the
Taxes Management Act 1970. This is subject to certain exceptions prescribed by
regulations for failures to be “treated as satisfying” the relevant condition
(“prescribed ‘minor failures’”, as Henderson LJ described them) (para 12(2)).
Also a company that has failed to comply is treated as satisfying the condition
if HMRC are “of the opinion that … the company had a reasonable excuse for the
failure to comply” and that it “complied … without unreasonable delay after the
excuse had ceased” (para 12(3)). The company must also have paid required
social security contributions during the qualifying period (para 12(4)); and
have complied with specified obligations under the Companies Act 1985 (para
12(5)). Paragraph 13 enables the Treasury by order, subject to approval in
draft by the House of Commons, to vary the conditions for registration for
gross payment.</a></p><a name="para7">

the person must be registered for payment under deduction (section 66(6)). As

appeal by notice given to HMRC within 30 days. Provision for HMRC review or

Management Act 1970. A favourable conclusion on HMRC review is treated as if it
were an agreement for settlement under section 54, and so equivalent to a
determination of the appeal (section 49F(2)). As already seen, the first two
cancellations were disposed of in this way. However, on the third occasion,
HMRC maintained its position and the appeal accordingly was referred to the

</span>As already noted, the FTT allowed the appeal, holding that HMRC had been
wrong not to take account of the likely impact on the company’s business. The
tribunal described section 66 as giving a “general unfettered discretion” to
take account of the impact on a business of cancellation. It thought that HMRC
must have itself have taken some account of such factors in its decisions on
the two reviews, even though no specific reasons were given. It saw good
reasons for the distinction between registration and cancellation, because of
the serious implications of cancellation for an existing business (paras
60-62).</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As already noted, the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal took a
different view. It is unnecessary to repeat their detailed reasoning. Henderson
LJ approach is encapsulated in the following passage:</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para14">“60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of first
impression, I cannot find any indication in this tightly constructed statutory
scheme </a><a name="_Hlk514335388">that Parliament intended HMRC to have the power,
and still less a duty, to take into account matters extraneous to the CIS
regime, when deciding whether or not to exercise the power of cancellation in
section 66(1). By ‘matters extraneous to the CIS regime’ I mean in particular,
in the present context, matters which do not relate, directly or indirectly, to
the requirements for registration for gross payment, and to the objective of
securing compliance with those requirements.</a> My preliminary view,
therefore, is that consideration of the financial impact on the taxpayer of
cancellation would fall well outside the intended scope of the power.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He found nothing in the submissions to displace that
first impression. In particular, he saw no difficulty in explaining the
discretion given by section 66, as compared with the registration provisions,
given the highly prescriptive nature of the regime:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… It seems to me entirely
appropriate, and a substantial protection for the registered person, that HMRC
should then be given a discretion whether or not to exercise the power of
cancellation, even in cases where the condition in section 66(1)(a) is
satisfied. The Upper Tribunal gave two examples, in para 64 of the UT Decision,
quoted above, of cases where HMRC might properly exercise such discretion in
the taxpayer’s favour, without travelling outside what I would regard as the
proper scope of the power. It needs to be remembered, in this connection, that
the ‘reasonable excuse’ exception does not apply to all the requirements of the
compliance test, and in the absence of any discretion even a single minor
failure to pay national insurance contributions on the due date, or a minor
failure to comply with one of the Companies Act requirements, would be fatal,
even if there were a reasonable excuse for the non-compliance. Similarly, the
rigid structure of Regulation 32 itself leaves no scope for the exercise of any
discretion, even if the relevant test was failed by a narrow margin, the amount
involved was relatively small, and although (when viewed in isolation) there
was no reasonable excuse for the non-compliance, there was nevertheless good
reason to suppose that it would not be repeated. I therefore remain unpersuaded
that there is any need to broaden the scope of the discretion conferred by
section 66(1) in order to provide it with any worthwhile content.” (para 63)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In respect of the alternative argument under the Convention, Henderson
LJ noted (para 37) that it was common ground before the Court of Appeal that
both registration for gross payment, and the contractual right to payment of
the contract price, constituted “possessions” for the purposes of A1/P1.
However, he did not accept that any interference with those possessions was
disproportionate:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Given the practical and
cash-flow advantages of registration for gross payment, it is always probable
that cancellation of the registration will seriously affect the taxpayer's
business. Far from being exceptional, such consequences are likely to be the
norm, and taxpayers must be taken to be well aware of the risks to their
business which cancellation will bring. In individual cases, of which this may
perhaps be one, the result may seem harsh; but a degree of harshness in a
regime which is designed to counter tax evasion, and where continued compliance
is within the power of the sub-contractor, cannot in my view be characterised
as disproportionate. Both deterrence, and ease of compliance, are important
factors which help to make the CIS scheme as a whole clearly compliant with
A1P1 …” (para 80)</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The submissions in this court</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The company (by Mr Chacko and Miss Boyd of Counsel) argue that the
discretion given by section 66 should be taken at face value. It is in terms
unfettered, and there is nothing to indicate an intention to exclude
consideration of the practical effect of cancellation. Absent a contrary
indication, they submit, the consequences of the exercise of a power must be
assumed to be a relevant consideration. They contrast, for example, Schedule 56,
para 9 to the Finance Act 2009, which provides for mitigation of certain
penalties in “special circumstances”, but specifically excludes consideration
of the taxpayer’s ability to pay. If Parliament had wished to limit the scope
of the discretion under section 66 it would have used express words. There was
no logical dividing line between the scope of the discretion accepted as
permissible by the Court of Appeal, and that argued for by the company. Nor was
a broader discretion inconsistent with the proper exercise of HMRC’s statutory
functions, as illustrated for example by the wide discretion accepted as
appropriate in the context of customs penalties: see <i>Denley v Revenue and
Customs Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2017/340.html">[2017] UKUT 340 (TCC)</a>, paras 13-14.</p>

</span>Such a discretion also reflects the well-established proposition that
removal of an advantageous trading status has a more serious impact on a
business than refusal to grant the status in the first place. They cite the
common law principle of proportionality as applied in the well-known case of <i>R
v Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, Ex p Hook</i> [1976] 1 WLR 1052, 1057,
where Lord Denning MR said:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]here are old cases which show
that the court can interfere by certiorari if a punishment is altogether
excessive and out of proportion to the occasion … It is quite wrong that the
Barnsley Corporation should inflict upon [Mr Hook] the grave penalty of
depriving him of his livelihood. That is a far more serious penalty than
anything the magistrates could inflict. He is a man of good character, and ought
not to be penalised thus …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the alternative, as in the courts below, they rely on A1/P1. As was
accepted before the Court of Appeal, they submit that cancellation clearly
involves an interference with the possessions represented by (at least) the
sub-contractor’s entitlement to the full contract price or the bundle of rights
inherent in registration. Although the article preserves the right of the state
to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to secure the payment of tax, that
is still subject to the requirement of proportionality. They rely on the words
of Lord Phillips MR in <i>Lindsay v Customs and Excise Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/267.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 267</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/267.html">[2002] 1 WLR 1766</a>, para 52:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“…Under Article 1 of the First
Protocol to the Convention such deprivation will only be justified if it is in
the public interest. More specifically, the deprivation can be justified if it
is ‘to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties’. The
action taken must, however, strike a fair balance between the rights of the
individual and the public interest. There must be a reasonable relationship of
proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued … I would accept
[counsel’s] submission that one must consider the individual case to ensure that
the penalty imposed is fair. However strong the public interest, it cannot
justify subjecting an individual to an interference with his fundamental rights
that is unconscionable.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">They rely to the same effect on the necessary balance as
described by Lord Reed in <i>Bank Mellat v Her Majesty’s Treasury (No 2)</i>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This it is submitted can only be done by assessing the
severity of the consequences for the particular individual in question, even if
the legislative scheme taken as a whole is proportionate.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For HMRC Mr Eadie QC generally supports the reasoning of the Court of
Appeal. In respect of the Convention, he does not accept that cancellation
involves an interference with a possession for the purposes of A1P1. The
subcontractor’s right to payment of the contract price is in law subject to the
limits imposed by the statutory scheme. Similarly, any benefits from
registration flow from the statutory scheme and are subject to its conditions,
including the risk of cancellation. He relies on the distinction drawn by the
Strasbourg court in <i>JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/921.html">(2006) 43 EHRR 3</a> (the same point did not arise in the Grand Chamber: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/5559.html">(2008) 46 EHRR 45</a>). At
para 51 the court considered the circumstances in which a legislative provision
is to be regarded as “an incident of, or limitation on, the applicants’
property right at the time of its acquisition”. It explained:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Article 1 does not cease to be
engaged merely because a person acquires property subject to the provisions of
the general law, the effect of which is in certain specified events to bring
the property right to an end, and because those events have in fact occurred.
Whether it does so will depend on whether the law in question is properly to be
seen <i>as qualifying or limiting the property right at the moment of
acquisition</i> or, whether it is rather to be seen as depriving the owner of
an existing right at the point when the events occur and the law takes effect.
It is only in the former case that article 1 may be held to have no application.”
(Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The present case, Mr Eadie submits, comes clearly into
the former category. The power of cancellation for non-compliance is an
intrinsic part of the “possession” from the moment of acquisition; its exercise
cannot engage the article.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, he submits, it is clearly within the wide margin allowed
by the Convention in fiscal matters: see <i>Gasus Dosier-und Fördentechnik GmbH
v Netherlands</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1995/7.html">(1995) 20 EHRR 403</a>, para 59. <i>National &amp; Provincial Building

has also made clear that the margin may extend to the adoption by the state of
“general measures which apply to pre-defined situations regardless of the
individual facts of each case even if this might result in individual hard
cases”: <i>Animal Defenders International v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/362.html">(2013) 57 EHRR 21</a>, para 106.</p>

</span>Attractively though the appeal has been argued, I have no doubt that the
Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion, substantially for the reasons
they gave. Apart from the Convention, the company’s submission comes down to a
short point: that is, given the existence of a discretion in section 66, it
must in the absence of any specific restriction be treated as an unfettered
discretion. That to my mind overlooks the basic principle that any statutory
discretion must be exercised consistently with the objects and scope of the
statutory scheme.</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>Like Henderson LJ, I cannot read the power as extending to matters
“which do not relate, directly or indirectly, to the requirements for
registration for gross payment, and to the objective of securing compliance
with those requirements” (para 60). He rightly emphasised the highly
prescriptive nature of the scheme. This starts with the narrowly defined
conditions for registration in the first place, among which the record of
compliance with the tax and other statutory requirements is a mandatory
element, allowing no element of discretion. The same conditions are brought
into the cancellation procedure by section 66. The mere fact that the
cancellation power is not itself mandatory is unsurprising. Some element of
flexibility may be desirable in any enforcement regime to allow for cases where
the failure is limited and temporary (even if not within the prescribed
classes) and poses no practical threat to the objectives of the scheme. It is
wholly inconsistent with that tightly drawn scheme for there to be implied a
general dispensing power such as implied by the company’s submissions.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to A1/P1 I see force in Mr Eadie’s submission that, even
accepting that rights conferred by registration amount to “possessions”, they
cannot extend beyond the limits set by the legislation by which they are
created. However, I find it unnecessary to rest my decision on that point,
since I have no doubt that the Court of Appeal were right to hold that any
interference was proportionate. Once it is accepted that the statute does not
in itself require the consideration of the impact on the individual taxpayer,
there is nothing in A1/P1 which would justify the court in reading in such a
requirement. Registration is a privilege conferred by the legislation, which
has significant economic advantages, but it is subject to stringent conditions
and the risk of cancellation. The impact on the company is no different in kind
