<p class="NewSpeech">LADY ARDEN:</p> <h1><a name="_Toc46838281">OVERVIEW</a></h1> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN">The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (UK) (“CIFF”) is a charitable company with more than $4bn in assets helping children in developing countries. It was founded by Sir Christopher Hohn (“Sir Christopher”) and Ms Jamie Cooper (“Ms Cooper”) in 2002, but it became difficult to manage when their marriage broke down. To resolve those difficulties, Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper agreed that in exchange for a grant (“the Grant”) of $360m, to be paid over five years, to Big Win Philanthropy (“BWP”), a charity founded by Ms Cooper, she would resign as a member and trustee of CIFF. CIFF, Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper entered into a </span>grant agreement (“the Grant Agreement”) for this purpose on 25 July 2015.</a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main legal issues in the case stem from the special combination of three factors. First, the relevant arrangements came about with a view to resolving the governance issues resulting from the breakdown in the relationship between Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper, not for a reason derived from the activities of the charity. Second, CIFF is both a charity and a company limited by guarantee (not having a share capital) formed and registered on 8 February 2002 under the Companies Act 1985. I will call such companies “guarantee companies”. As a guarantee company, CIFF has a two-tier governance structure, namely members and directors, the latter being called trustees, and the Companies Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) applies to it. Dr Lehtimäki, the first respondent and a central figure in this appeal, is a member of CIFF, as are Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper. They were the original subscribers to the memorandum of association.

Dr Lehtimäki and Sir Christopher argue that the appeal should be dismissed and the decision of the Court of Appeal upheld on additional grounds. This is because - while Dr Lehtimäki and Sir Christopher agree that the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that it did not have the power to direct Dr Lehtimäki to vote in favour of the Grant - they do not want the Supreme Court to uphold every aspect of the Court of Appeal’s decision. In particular, they contend that the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that the members of CIFF owe fiduciary duties. CIFF and HM Attorney General have made submissions for the assistance of the Court, and CIFF also advances positive criticisms of the conclusion of both courts below that a member of a charitable company is a fiduciary. (This is the subject of Issue 1, below). The Attorney General must be joined to proceedings of this nature and represents the Crown in its role as <i>parens patriae </i>or protector of charities, an important and very long-established role.

The Chancellor held, at para 128, that in the “unique circumstances” of this “extremely unusual” case, the Grant was in the best interests of CIFF. In approving the Grant, the principal reasons given by the Chancellor were that the parties should not be allowed to renege on the deal they had made in good faith, that Ms Cooper would be contributing a further $40m to her new charity and that approving the Grant would bring finality and avoid further legal costs. The Chancellor referred to the considerable talents of Ms Cooper. The Chancellor expressly stated that, while he had come to a clear conclusion that he should approve the Grant, <span style="color:#212121">he was “not saying that no reasonable trustee or fiduciary could disagree with [his] view” that the Grant was in the best interests of CIFF or that “anyone who disagreed with [his] view would automatically be acting in bad faith” (Judgment, para 135).</span></a></p><a name="para19">

There was no applicable exception from these provisions. Therefore the 2006 Act requires CIFF to disclose the Grant to members and obtain their approval by resolution. This is now common ground, and I will refer to the required resolution as “the section 217 resolution”.

In his judgment, members of a charitable company were bound into the regime in the 2011 Act, under which the assets of a charitable company could only be used for charitable purposes (para 144). He further held that the members could not use assets for non-charitable purposes. Accepting, at para 145, the submissions made on behalf of the Attorney General and Ms Cooper that the members did not “stand outside the charity”, the Chancellor held that the members of CIFF were an integral part of the administration of the charity.

The member was a fiduciary and would not be acting in the best interests of the charity if he came to a different conclusion from that of the court.

Since we are not dealing with such an organisation, we do not need to decide whether their members are in the same position as CIFF’s. There may possibly, moreover, be scope for argument as to whether it is less reasonable to expect those belonging to mass-membership charities to act exclusively in the charities’ interests. That said, it is far from clear that it should be legitimate for members of, say, the National Trust to vote to obtain benefits for themselves from an entity with exclusively charitable objects.”</p>

In other words, the member must exercise the powers that he has in that capacity in the way that <i>he</i> decides, in good faith, would be most likely to further the purposes of CIFF. It should be stressed that this duty is subjective: in other words, that what matters is the member’s state of mind (compare eg <i>Regentcrest plc v Cohen</i> [2001] 2 BCLC 80, para 120, dealing with company directors).”</p>

A CIO has a separate legal personality from the individual trustees, and limited liability. Like a charitable company, a CIO has two tiers of governance: (1) the trustees and (2) the members.

The Chancellor’s order would prevent Dr Lehtimäki from exercising his choice as to whether to approve the transaction in accordance with section 217 and stop him from playing a part which in the circumstances Parliament had assigned him. There was no significant evidence of breach of duty and the Court of Appeal noted that the Chancellor had expressly accepted that he was not saying that no reasonable trustee could disagree with his decision that the Grant should be approved (Judgment, para 135). <span style="color:#212121">It was therefore reasonably open to Dr </span>Lehtimäki<span style="color:#212121"> to disagree.</span></a></p><a name="para32"> </a><h2><a name="para32"></a><a name="_Toc46838287">Issues on this appeal</a></h2>

A person has to be a fiduciary for the court’s jurisdiction over fiduciaries to be engaged. This is a threshold question. Both the Chancellor and the Court of Appeal decided this issue in favour of the appellant, but Dr Lehtimäki contends that it should have been decided in his favour. I have added the words “in relation to the objects of the charity” because, as Frankfurter J held in <i>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v Chenery Corpn</i> (1943) </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1943/32.html">318 US 80</a>, 85-86:</p>

The jurisdiction to intervene in relation to the discretionary actions of trustees is in general governed by the principle, known as “the non-intervention principle”, that (in the absence of evidence of breach of duty) the court does not intervene in the exercise by a fiduciary of a discretion. The Court of Appeal decided this issue against the appellant, but Lord Pannick QC contends that it was wrong in law to do so.</a></p><a name="para36">

A major reason for a distinction between the court’s jurisdiction over fiduciaries who owe duties to the purposes of a charity and its jurisdiction over those who owe duties to the beneficiaries under a private settlement is in relation to schemes, which are not available for private trusts. However, this may not be the only distinction because the fact that the trust is charitable is clearly part of the circumstances, and the court must have regard to all the circumstances when considering whether to intervene in relation to a trustee’s exercise of a discretionary power.</a></p><a name="para37">

Lord Pannick, for the appellant, submits that the court could also grant the relief sought in this case against Dr Lehtimäki under its separate jurisdiction to make a scheme for a charity. However, the direction sought against Dr Lehtimäki does not fall within the meaning of scheme since it neither relates to the purposes of CIFF nor affects the management and administration of the charity. Lord Pannick points out that in <i>Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v The Secretary for Justice</i> <span style="color:#212121"></span></a><a href="http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2015/35.html">[2015] HKCFA 35</a>, para 41, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe NPJ (formerly a Justice of this Court and sitting in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong) referred to a scheme as “a written instrument approved by the court to regulate, in whole or in part, the future management and administration of the trust”, but it is important not to take this observation out of context. I do not consider that Lord Walker’s observation is intended to remove the distinction to be drawn between on the one hand schemes, which may operate in the way Lord Walker described or concern the charity’s purposes, and on the other hand directions which may be given in the operation of a charity by the Charity Commission or the court.</p>

The words “infinite” and “relentless” aptly indicate the capacity of equity to develop to meet new challenges. Over the years these duties were also imposed on directors, agents, solicitors and others. The term “fiduciary” is used to cover all persons subject to these duties, including trustees, and it is therefore a wider term than that of trustee.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There has been considerable debate as to how to define a fiduciary, but it is generally accepted today that the key principle is that a fiduciary acts for and only for another. He owes essentially the duty of single-minded loyalty to his beneficiary, meaning that he cannot exercise any power so as to benefit himself. In <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/533.html">[1998] Ch 1</a>, 18 Millett LJ described the duties of a fiduciary as follows:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So “the distinguishing obligation” of a fiduciary is that he must act only for the benefit of another in matters covered by his fiduciary duty.

The fiduciary is likely to owe other fiduciary duties as well, such as the duty to act in the best interests of the person to whom the duty is owed. Section 178(2) of the 2006 Act expressly makes this a fiduciary duty in the case of company directors. It is not necessary to consider whether these duties are fiduciary duties in all cases. It is not enough that a person has agreed to perform certain duties by agreement. As the Privy Council held in <i>In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1994/3.html">[1995] 1 AC 74</a>, 98 “The essence of a fiduciary relationship is that it creates obligations of a different character from those deriving from the contract itself”.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal adopted the following test put forward by Finn J, sitting in the Federal Court of Australia, in <i>Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2)</i> (2012) </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/6.html">287 ALR 22</a>, para 177:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… a person will be in a fiduciary relationship with another when and in so far as that person has undertaken to perform such a function for, or has assumed such a responsibility to, another as would thereby reasonably entitle that other to expect that he or she will act in that other’s interest to the exclusion of his or her own or a third party’s interest …”</p>

Reasonable expectation may not be appropriate in every case, but it is, with that qualification, consistent with the duty of single-minded loyalty. There was a suggestion in this case that a member would not expect to find that he was a fiduciary. However, there was no evidence about that, and Mr Robert Pearce QC, for Her Majesty’s Attorney General, pointed to a publication of the Charity Commission available since 2004 and entitled <i>RS7-Membership Charities</i>. This makes it clear that the Charity Commission takes the view that members of a charitable company have an obligation to use their rights and exercise their vote in the best interests of the charity of which they are a member (p 18), and that “the rights that exist in relation to the administration of a charitable institution are fiduciary” (p 33). (There are similarities here with the duty imposed on members of a CIO by section 220 and indeed <i>RS7-Membership Charities</i> contemplates that members of a CIO would be placed under that duty.)</a></p><a name="para48">

This view derives support from a number of decisions where that was assumed to be the case: see, for example, <i>Bolton v Madden</i> LR 9 QB 55, 57 where the Court of Queen’s Bench (now the High Court) on appeal from the Lord Mayor’s Court held that they could “find no legal principle to justify us in holding that the subscriber to a charity may not give his votes as he pleases”. However, it seems to me that when it comes to finding whether there is a reasonable expectation in the public at large, the Charity Commission’s published guidance must have more weight than even much respected legal commentaries. For the reasons given below at para 104, I do not consider that <i>Bolton v Madden</i> is necessarily inconsistent with members of a charitable company owing a fiduciary duty.</a></p><a name="para49">

The Court of Appeal in this case also expressed that view. As will hereafter become clear, I take the view that any fiduciary duty is owed not to the company (viz CIFF in this case) but to the charitable purposes or objects of the charity. The Attorney General or a duly qualified individual can bring charity proceedings to enforce this duty: see section 115 of the 2011 Act. (That section imposes limits on the bringing of proceedings: see section 115(2), which requires an order of the court or of the Charity Commission, and the case law on section 115). My conclusion is consistent with section 172(2) of the 2006 Act which provides that directors of companies set up for altruistic purposes owe their fiduciary duty to promote the purposes of the company:</a></p><a name="para50"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where or to the extent that the purposes of the company consist of or include purposes other than the benefit of its members, subsection (1) has effect as if the reference to promoting the success of the company for the benefit of its members were to achieving those purposes.”</p>

This is only one of the situations in which a fiduciary duty may arise. It is important to examine the very specific context in which it is said that a fiduciary duty arises. This point was made by Sales J:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The touchstone is to ask what obligations of a fiduciary character may reasonably be expected to apply <i>in the particular context</i>, where the contract between the parties will usually provide the major part of the contextual framework in which that question arises.” (para 223) (Emphasis added)</p> <h3><a name="_Toc46838292"><span style="text-decoration:none">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Companies as charities</a></h3> <h4 style="margin-left:36.0pt"><a name="_Toc46838293">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backdrop</a></h4>

There is also little scholarship or textbook commentary on this issue. However, there are other signposts to guide the courts: first, the liberal interpretation taken to charities by the courts, second, the recognition of charitable companies by Parliament, and, third, the decision of Slade J (as he then was) in <i>Liverpool and District</i> <i>Hospital for the Diseases of the Heart v Attorney General </i>[1981] Ch 193 (“the <i>Liverpool and District</i> case”).

These provisions are engrafted on to the model established by the companies legislation so that charitable companies may be subject to two levels of regulation. A notable example of this is section 198 of the 2011 Act, which places restrictions on the amendments which a charitable company may effectively make to its memorandum and articles of association:</a></p><a name="para58">

Section 30(2) for the first time prevented a charitable company from altering its objects and then treating the assets as part of its general assets in response to the Report of the Committee on the Law and Practice relating to Charitable Trusts (the Nathan Committee), Cmd 8710 (1952), para 573, cited by Mr Pearce. A company still has the powers conferred by the Companies Acts to alter its memorandum and articles of association even though it is also a charitable company. The 2011 Act remedies the consequences for charitable companies. The ruling of Slade J in the <i>Liverpool and District</i> case that a company is not a trustee in the strict sense of the charitable assets but has a beneficial interest in them is entirely consistent with the approach taken in section 30(2).</a></p>

Neither the 2006 Act nor the 2011 Act further analyses the effect of the incorporation of a charity.</a></p><a name="para61">

It must have occurred to charity trustees (assuming the charity was not incorporated by Royal Charter or a statutory corporation) that it would be useful if charities could be incorporated under a general Act of Parliament by about 1870 because in 1872 Parliament passed the Charitable Trustees Incorporation Act 1872 (“the 1872 Act”) providing that trustees could apply to the Charity Commissioners to be incorporated. This secured the perpetual succession of the trustees, which meant there was no need to convey property or transfer securities to new persons every time there was a change of trustees. This system continues to exist (see now section 251 of the 2011 Act).</a></p><a name="para62"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some charities avoided the problems resulting from the lack of perpetual succession by vesting land and securities in the Official Custodian, but where this was not sufficient, a form of incorporation was needed. The form of incorporation originally provided by the 1872 Act and now by section 251 of the 2011 Act is not generally satisfactory since it does not provide that the incorporated body would have limited liability or provide any rules for its internal management or dissolution, and an early edition of <i>Tudor on</i> <i>Charities</i> stated in the footnotes that “[t]he powers of the Act are in practice never used.”</a></p><a name="para63"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is quite possible that what happened was that the need for incorporation was satisfied by charities being incorporated through companies registered under the Companies Acts and that they sought to register names dispensing with the word “limited”. That gave the Board of Trade as it then was the power to impose conditions (which applied to other types of company as well) that the memorandum of association should state that the property and funds of the company should be used only for promoting the objects of the charity and do not belong to the members of the charity and no portion would be distributed to members with minor exceptions for reasonable and proper remuneration for services provided, interest up to 5% on loans and proper rent. To dispense with the word “limited”, the memorandum also had to state that the persons fulfilling the role of directors should be accountable for the company’s property which came into their hands and for their own acts and omissions as if the company had not been incorporated. This wording may have been based on section 5 of the 1872 Act which provided that despite incorporation all the trustees should be “<span style="color:black;background: white">chargeable for such property as shall come into their hands, and shall be answerable and accountable for their own acts, receipts, neglects, and defaults, and for the due administration of the charity and its property, in the same manner and to the same extent as if no such incorporation had been effected” (see <i>Palmer’s Company Precedents</i>, 17th ed (1956), vol 1, p 290). This provision assumed that </span>on incorporation the charity continued, but now encased in corporate form. It also provided for all corporators who were trustees to be liable to the charity as they were before without making any distinction between directors and members.</a></p><a name="para64">

Those companies do not have a founding statute of their own but are subject to a mosaic of statutory provisions. Another key point is that Parliament clearly considered that a company with exclusively charitable objects should itself in law be a charity for the purposes of the 2011 Act.</a></p><a name="para65">

A charitable company had been formed to provide a hospital and promote research into diseases of the heart and other ailments. Its memorandum of association, but not its articles, provided that on winding up its assets should not be distributed amongst its members but transferred to an institution having similar objects. On the formation of the National Health Service, the hospital which it ran was transferred to the National Health Service. The company continued to do research until it discontinued its activities and was wound up on the petition of the Attorney General. At that point it was realised that, under section 302 of the Companies Act 1948 (now to be found in section 107 of the Insolvency Act 1986), surplus assets had to be distributed to the members of the company unless the articles otherwise provided. So the liquidator issued a summons in the liquidation for directions as to whether this statutory provision displaced the provisions of the company’s memorandum of association. One of the arguments was that the assets of the charity did not belong to the company. The matter came before Slade J who considered the law in great depth.</a></p><a name="para67"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Slade J concluded that the company’s relationship to its assets was analogous to that of a trustee. It was not a trustee in the strict sense. It retained a beneficial interest in its assets and so they fell to be applied in accordance with the Companies Acts. However, the members had agreed to the memorandum of association and therefore this took effect and was binding on them. Even though there was no similar provision, as there is in CIFF’s articles of association dealing with the distribution of surplus assets on winding up, the articles were subordinate to the memorandum and the provisions of the memorandum took effect. Finally, the court had jurisdiction now to order that assets be applied cy-près. This arose not only where there was a strict trust but also in relation to the assets of a charitable company where under the terms of its constitution there was a legally binding obligation to apply its assets for exclusively charitable purposes. Slade J accordingly directed that the company’s assets should be applied cy-près.</a></p><a name="para68"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching his decision, Slade J relied on the judgment of Buckley LJ in two important cases which it is convenient to mention here. The first was <i>Construction Industry Training Board v Attorney General</i> [1973] Ch 173, where the principal issue was whether a body set up by statute and subject to the control of a minister of the Crown was a “charity” within the meaning of section 45(1) of the Charities Act 1960, for which purpose it had to be subject to “the control of the High Court in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities”. The case highlights that the High Court has two relevant bases of jurisdiction that can be invoked in the case of charities: its jurisdiction over trusts generally and its jurisdiction over charities. However, the reference to the control of the High Court did not refer to the court’s power over statutory bodies generally to control actions outside their powers. The majority (Buckley LJ and Plowman J, Russell LJ dissenting) held that sufficient control was vested in the High Court despite the fact that the minister had complete control over the running of the board. That issue does not arise in this case, but it led to an illuminating description of the court’s extensive jurisdiction over charities in the judgment of Buckley LJ:</a></p><a name="para69"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is a function of the Crown as parens patriae to ensure the due administration of established charities and the proper application of funds devoted to charitable purposes. This it normally does through the instrumentality of the courts, but this is not the only way in which the Crown can regulate charities or the application of charitable funds. Where a charity has been incorporated by Royal Charter, the Crown may amend its constitution or vary its permitted objects by granting a supplemental charter. Where funds are given for charitable purposes in circumstances in which no express or implied trust is created, the Crown can regulate the application of those funds by means of a scheme under the sign manual. Where the Crown invokes the assistance of the courts for such purposes, the jurisdiction which is invoked is, I think, a branch of the court’s jurisdiction in relation to trusts. In such cases the relief granted often takes the form of an order approving a scheme for the administration of the charity which has been laid before the court, but this is not the only way in which the court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of a charity or over charity trustees. The approval of a scheme of this nature is, so far as I am aware, a form of relief peculiar to charities, but it does not constitute relief of a kind given in the exercise of a jurisdiction confined to giving relief of that sort. The court could, for instance, restrain trustees from applying charitable funds in breach of trust by means of an injunction. In the case of a charity incorporated by statute this might, as was suggested in the present case, be explained as an application of the doctrine of ultra vires, but I do not think that this would be a satisfactory explanation, for a similar order upon unincorporated trustees could not be so explained. Or, by way of further example, the court could order charity trustees to make good trust funds which they had misapplied, or could order them to account, or could remove or appoint trustees, or could exercise any other kind of jurisdiction available in the execution of trusts other than charitable trusts. In every such case the court would be acting upon the basis that the property affected is not in the beneficial ownership of the persons or body in whom its legal ownership is vested but is devoted to charitable purposes, that is to say, is held upon charitable trusts. Any relief of this kind is, in my judgment, appropriately described as relief granted in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities, and, where the relief is such as to bind the body of trustees as a whole, this would, in my opinion, constitute control of the charity by the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction with respect to charities. I consequently feel unable to accept the suggestion put forward on behalf of the Attorney General that the reference in section 45 of the Act of 1960 to the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities is in some way confined to its jurisdiction to approve charitable schemes.” (pp 186-187)</p>

A further factor which weighed with Buckley LJ was that the minister had no powers of enforcement: the minister would have to invoke the assistance of the courts. The court could make a scheme even if the charity was not a trust in the strict sense.</a></p><a name="para70">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We were referred to certain authorities which give support to the view that a company incorporated for exclusively charitable purposes is in the position of a trustee of its funds or at least in an analogous position. The authorities were <i>In re French Protestant Hospital</i> [1951] Ch 567; <i>Soldiers’, Sailors’ and Airmen’s Families Association v Attorney General</i> [1968] 1 WLR 313; <i>Construction Industry Training Board v Attorney General</i> [1973] Ch 173 and <i>In re Finger’s Will Trusts</i> [1972] Ch 286. In the first two of these cases it seems to me that it was assumed, rather than decided, that a corporate charity was in the position of a trustee of its funds. In the third, the question was what was meant by the words ‘in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities’ in section 45(1) of the Charities Act 1960. In the course of my judgment in that case I certainly did express the view that the court would exercise its jurisdiction over corporate charities on the basis that their assets were held on charitable trusts and it appears to me that Plowman J, as I understand his very short judgment, agreed with me in that respect. <i>In re Finger’s Will Trusts</i> turned on a question of whether or not a bequest to a charitable corporation, which ceased to exist in the testatrix’s lifetime, demonstrated a general charitable intention capable of permitting a cy-près application. I do not think that it is a decision which is of assistance for present purposes.”</p>

The <i>Liverpool and District</i> case evidences two points which are wider than the point just described. It is a yet further example of the determination of the courts to give effect to the charitable objects and not to allow technical matters, such as the reference to the company’s articles in section 302, to prevent the gift to charity taking effect. It would be a break with a long-standing tradition if this court was to depart from that approach. It also demonstrates another point, this time new as there had been little or no litigation about charitable companies registered under the Companies Acts in this regard before, namely the court’s determination to make the statutory framework cohesive where this could be achieved.</a></p><a name="para72">

This decision was cited with approval by Lord Walker in <i>Chinachem</i>. It recognised that registered companies could be charities, and that meant that the new charitable vehicle had to meet both the charitable and corporate model. The members would be affected by the fact that the company was charitable because the practice was and is that the memoranda of association of charitable companies should provide that the assets should only be applied towards its charitable objects and other restrictions. The memorandum and articles of the company “<span style="background:white">bind the company and its members to the same extent as if there were covenants on the part of the company and of each member to observe those provisions” (see section 33(1) of the 2006 Act, which is derived from the Companies Act 1862, sections 11 and 16). So, members</span> could not assert rights in disregard of their contractual obligations to the charity.</a></p><a name="para73">

The property of the company is solely applicable to charitable purposes, so a member undertakes functions to promote charitable purposes to the exclusion of any benefit to himself. The members of CIFF fall squarely within the test of who is a fiduciary set out in <i>Grimaldi</i>. The obligations of the members are to serve the purposes of the charity. It is unnecessary to go further than to say that if a member exercises his powers he must do so in a way that he decides in good faith would be most likely to promote the purposes of the charity.</a></p><a name="para77"> </a><h3><a name="para77"></a><a name="_Toc46838298"><span style="text-decoration:none">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My conclusions on the question whether a member is a fiduciary</a></h3>

The court has to determine whether there is a fiduciary relationship between the charitable objects of CIFF and Dr Lehtimäki in his capacity <i>qua</i> member of CIFF. In my view that question falls to be answered in the affirmative, and what applies to Dr Lehtimäki and CIFF will apply to all other members of charitable guarantee companies which, like CIFF, contain restrictions which in general prevent members receiving profits from the company. Moreover, such restrictions are generally contained in the memorandum and articles of association of charitable companies.</a></p><a name="para78">

Slade J gave precedence to the fact that a member had agreed to become a member of a charity.

There is therefore no difficulty in a member delegating the right to vote to a general proxy if that is what the 2006 Act and the articles allow.

As to means, the members can resolve to amend the memorandum and articles of association within the powers conferred by the 2006 Act and subject to compliance with restrictions imposed by the 2011 Act. As to the extent to which a person’s fiduciary duties may be reduced before he ceases to be a fiduciary, the principle is that there is no difficulty with this so long as the duties of a fiduciary nature are not reduced below the “irreducible core” of obligations identified by Millett LJ in <i>Armitage v Nurse</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/1279.html">[1998] Ch 241</a>, 253-254:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“there is an irreducible core of obligations owed by the trustees to the beneficiaries and enforceable by them which is fundamental to the concept of a trust. If the beneficiaries have no rights enforceable against the trustees there are no trusts … The duty of the trustees to perform the trusts honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries is the minimum necessary to give substance to the trusts, but in my opinion it is sufficient.”</p>

The Court of Appeal<span style="color:black;background:white"> (Sir Anthony Clarke MR, Arden and Dyson LJJ)</span> rejected that argument by reference to various other powers which the trust deed vested in the trustee and the trustee’s obligation to act in good faith. So, there must be some fiduciary duty which the court can enforce but it need not extend to the full range of fiduciary duties which a fiduciary might owe. I need not express a view on the further question whether, if the duties were reduced below the irreducible minimum, the court could in any circumstances declare that reduction to be ineffective.</p>

In the present case, the memorandum of association as registered on incorporation contains exceptions from the no-conflict and no-profit principles. There is no reason why the memorandum of association should not validly authorise the trustees or members to be interested in the transactions within those exceptions or to retain the profits there mentioned.

The memorandum of association is open to public inspection at the Companies Registry (sections 9 and 1085 of the 2006 Act) and it is also available for inspection at the Charity Commission (section 38(4) of the 2011 Act). The provisions of the memorandum of association are a further indication that members should be treated as fiduciaries. It represents the understanding of CIFF and all its members that the members are fiduciaries and they have agreed to represent that position to the entire world.

There are, however, limitations on how a member may use his voting rights. For the purposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to go further on this than Briggs J (as he then was) did in <i>Assénagon Asset Management SA v Irish Bank Resolution Corpn Ltd (Formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corpn Ltd)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/2090.html">[2012] EWHC 2090 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/2090.html">[2013] Bus LR 266</a>, para 44:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis for the application of that principle in relation to powers conferred on majorities to bind minorities is traditionally described as arising from general principles of law and equity, and by way of implication.

What does that involve in the present context? In my judgment, it requires that he considers whether the resolution should be passed and that he do so only by considering the best interests of the objects of the charity. That is because the resolution involves a disposition of assets that would otherwise be available for application by CIFF towards those objects. There is no basis for saying that a member was intended to have any separate interest in this transaction. On Dr Lehtimäki’s case he neither provided those assets nor has any legitimate competing interest in the application of those assets. That does not mean to say that he would be bound to approach every members’ resolution of CIFF with only the charitable beneficiaries in mind. There may be some resolutions where a member may be able to take other interests into account as well.</p>

The duty as I have found it to be exactly matches what Dr Lehtimäki for instance considers is required of him. More importantly it is also surely what both a potential beneficiary and member of the public would expect him to do. Moreover, and this harks back to my earlier discussion of the liberal approach taken towards charities by the courts, to hold that a member is a fiduciary is consistent with the “special” and “beneficent” treatment which the law gives to charities. That is no doubt because of their potential to benefit society and the public at large in a very major way. This is an appropriate consideration in this case because a charity must be established for public benefit. Sir Richard Scott V-C held in <i>Stanway v Attorney General</i>, 5 April 2000, unreported:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Charities operate within a framework of public law, not private law. The Crown is parens patriae of the charity and the judges of the courts represent the Crown in supervising what the charity is doing and in giving directions … The Attorney General’s function is to make representations to the court as to where lies the public interest as he sees it.” (transcript, p 4)</p>

That would include, for example, particulars of the proposed transaction: see section 217(3) read with section 215(3) of the 2006 Act. I consider that those limits mean that he cannot compel access to further information (though he could of course still ask the directors voluntarily to provide additional information). That is a limit on his role as a fiduciary, but that limit is not inconsistent with his position as a fiduciary because it is imposed by the structure which has been adopted for the administration of the charity. It is essentially a contract-and-statute-based model of fiduciary duty. The structure comprises both the statutory provisions in the Companies Acts and the agreement of the members and CIFF which is deemed to occur when the members agree to become members of it: see section 33(1) of the 2006 Act (set out in para 73 above). The 2011 Act (in addition to the general law) provides additional restrictions, but they are mainly from outside the structure.</a></p><a name="para92">

He submits that the interests of the charity are already well protected by the 2011 Act against the risk of members acting contrary to the charity’s best interests (see for example sections 197 to 202 of the 2011 Act) and there are constraints on which members can exercise their voting rights. Mr Guy Morpuss QC, for Dr Lehtimäki, further cites a learned article by Professor Worthington in which she expresses the view that the law should only consider a person to be a fiduciary if the obligations imposed by contract or tort, or the duty to act for proper purposes, would be insufficient for the task (<i>Fiduciaries: when is self-denial obligatory</i>? Professor S Worthington, (1999) 58 CLJ 1999 500, 506). But I do not consider that it is necessary to go that far. If Dr Lehtimäki is a fiduciary, then a well-known set of rules and remedies come into play. It will be easier for the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction over charities, and the law of charities will be more internally coherent.</a></p><a name="para93">

I accept that this is an important point, but <i>RS7-Membership Charities</i> has anticipated the point so that there was guidance from an official source already available. Also, approximately 65% (or 3,203 in number) of new charities registered with the Charity Commission in 2018 were CIOs, which suggests that section 220 of the 2011 Act is not seen as a disincentive by those charities.</a></p><a name="para94">

But this has a dual disadvantage: firstly, it would subject a member to this duty in all circumstances, and, secondly, it leaves open the full scope of a company member’s duties since section 220 does not state that this is an exhaustive statement of the duties of a member of a CIO. (Nor yet does that section make it clear whether this is a fiduciary duty or not: contrast section 178(2) of the 2006 Act applying to directors.)</a></p><a name="para95">

But suppose that he was going to be a trustee or member of BWP. This is not an interest which the memorandum or articles of CIFF has pre-authorised. The Companies Acts do not provide for the disclosure of this kind of interest by him as a member of CIFF. Moreover, there is neither any organ of the company which has the express function of receiving any disclosure of details of a conflict of interest nor any means of obtaining fully informed consent. But, certainly, he would not be able to vote as a member on any resolution concerning the benefit.</a></p><a name="para96">

I do not, however, consider that it is correct to say, as Mr Henderson argues, that this problem undermines the initial conclusion. The solution may be that, if Dr Lehtimäki could be said to thereby potentially obtain a benefit, the articles should be amended to permit a member to have this interest. The prior written consent of the Charity Commission is required only if Dr Lehtimäki would obtain a benefit: section 198(2)(c) of the 2011 Act. It may also be the Charity Commission could issue guidance under section 15(2) of the 2011 Act on conflicts of interest in order to reduce practical difficulties. It may similarly be possible for the problem to be solved by a scheme or by way of sanction under section 105 of the 2011 Act.</a></p><a name="para97">

In that case, the governor and directors of a charity set up by Royal Charter sought to exercise a power conferred on them by the charter to amend the byelaws to enable the directors’ professional firms to be remunerated for their services to the charity. Danckwerts J held that, even though they were not trustees, the governor and directors had the same duty as the corporation to apply the assets in furtherance of the charitable objects because in reality they controlled the corporation.<i> </i>They<i> </i>could not therefore authorise a benefit for themselves.

The company was therefore not a charity and so the question whether a member owes a fiduciary duty did not arise in the same way as it does in the case of a company which is exclusively charitable. In that case, the company had a share capital and had issued preference shares which had valuable rights on a winding up and sufficient votes to compel a winding up. The company was formed for charitable purposes but, because of the rights of the preference shareholders, those purposes were not exclusively charitable. Thus, the company failed in its bid to establish that it was a charity.</a></p><a name="para99">

The Court of Appeal stressed that the duty was subjective: I agree that it is for the member to reach a conclusion on that matter in good faith provided that he does not do so improperly or unreasonably, the court will not seek to intervene or to hold him liable if his view turns out to have been wrong in fact (see generally <i>Tempest v Lord Camoys</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1882/200.html">(1882) 21 Ch D 571</a>, where the court declined to order one trustee to act in accordance with the proposals of the other).</p>

Suppose, for example, that a charity runs a lending library but for those prepared to pay an annual subscription it also provides access to a small separate area for which the library has no use, but in which there has been installed a machine that dispenses coffee at cost. This is at no cost to the charity since the member pays an annual subscription to cover this cost. Suppose that the charity proposes a resolution at the annual meeting of the charity to reduce the opening hours of the separate area. It is difficult to see why a member should owe a duty of single-minded loyalty to the charitable objects on a matter on which only the members qua private individuals have an interest. Mr Pearce takes the different example of a separate arrangement between members and a charity: “if one becomes … a friend of the Royal Opera House, one pays them money and in return one gets priority booking. That is a completely different arrangement from anything to do with having a constitutional role in the affairs of the charity.” The precise circumstances in which the member of a charitable company has fiduciary duties in relation to the charitable purposes and the content of those duties will have to be worked out when they arise. The point of principle is the point made by P D Finn in <i>Fiduciary Obligations</i> (1977), para 4 that “[a] fiduciary for one obligation is not ipso facto a fiduciary for all”.</a></p><a name="para101">

Parliament has enacted the gift aid scheme for tax relief on donations, and that relief is available if minor gifts are made unless certain limits are exceeded. So, Parliament has recognised that charities do sometimes, and without losing their charitable status, give members minor benefits in exchange for donations. Those charities may well be charitable companies, because that vehicle, together with the CIO is often a preferred option for a charity that wishes to encourage a wide range of persons to become members. In <i>Bolton v Madden </i>LR 9 QB 55, the subscribers obtained the right to vote in exchange for their subscription.</a></p><a name="para102">

That would mean that they did not owe a duty of single-minded loyalty even though their powers could, as in this case, result in a substantial grant out of the assets held on charitable trusts. In my judgment the duty to exercise powers for a proper purpose does not adequately recognise the scope of members’ powers and it would not be consistent with the obligations of members of a CIO. I should add that there is no evidence before us that the duties imposed on members of a CIO is causing any difficulty in finding members of CIOs or that it creates an unsatisfactory level of uncertainty. Mr Jonathan Crow QC, for Sir Christopher, submits that it would be “astonishing” if members could not vote on their own appointments as directors or trustees, but with respect it seems to me wholly reasonable to say that a person must not vote for himself.</a></p><a name="para103">

That concerned two subscribers to an incorporated charity (and assuming that the incorporated charity was a registered company they would be members: see now section 16(2) of the 2006 Act). The issue was the lawfulness of an agreement to vote in favour of each other’s choice of charitable object. There is no suggestion that the parties to the agreement intended to select objects which did not qualify as charitable objects which were manifestly not appropriate for selection. When it comes to nominating charitable objects, the courts do not interfere with the choice made by the party entitled to nominate unless it is corrupt or outside the terms of the power or the person chosen is manifestly unfit. One example of this is <i>Attorney General v Dean and Canons of Christ Church</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1822/242.pdf">(1822) Jac 474</a>, 486 where Sir Thomas Plumer MR held that he did not “know how any restriction on [the] power [of the Dean and Canons conferred by the testator to manage a school in Portsmouth and choose persons to be educated there] [could] be introduced”. So long as that remains the law for charities generally it is difficult to see how members having a right of nomination as in <i>Bolton v Madden</i> could be held to a higher standard. But that is clearly a different situation from exercising a power which amounts to an effective veto on the disposition of charitable assets since that veto is a (negative) right of control comparable to the issue of payment in connection with a director’s loss of office to the right of control in <i>In re French Protestant Hospital</i>.</p> <h3><a name="_Toc46838299">Mass membership charitable companies</a></h3>

On the one hand there is a clear benefit in resolving the historic governance problems and achieving finality. On the other hand transferring $360m to BWP comes at a cost. How big a cost is unknown, particularly given the lack of available information in relation to BWP and its very limited track record. It may be large, and that is my biggest concern.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would very much like CIFF to be able to draw a line under its difficulties, and move forward, with no further risk of litigation.

If I am - in the future - able to vote on this issue, the points set out above are the ones that are likely to influence my decision.

Dr Lehtimäki has rightly identified the charitable purposes and recognised the need to exercise his right to vote in their interests. As I see it, he implicitly recognises what is in law a fiduciary duty. He does not indicate that there is any practical difficulty in recognising or performing the obligations attached to his right to vote. Those are important obligations and, given their fiduciary nature, there is an onus on the court to consider carefully how they are enforced.

The main principle should be that the jurisdiction should be exercised for the welfare of the beneficiaries and the trust estate. He submits that this is a general principle.

He submits that the court could not intervene in the decision of a fiduciary unless there was an actual or threatened breach of duty or the fiduciary had surrendered his discretion. The members had not surrendered their discretion to the court. Moreover, there was no question of any threatened or actual breach of duty. All the court could do in exercise of its special charitable jurisdiction was to direct a scheme, which it did not do. In any event there was no basis for directing a scheme because there had been no failure of machinery nor was an administrative scheme appropriate as that would involve changing the constitution of the charity. The present case does not fall within any exception to the non-intervention principle.

In <i>In re J W Laing</i> no order was made directing the trustee to perform any particular act.

For the reasons given in paras 121 to 173 below, I consider that the court can take jurisdiction through an exception to the non-intervention principle. Indeed, all the members of this Court agree that, if an exception to the non-intervention principle is needed, it can be found. Lord Briggs, however, joined by Lord Wilson and Lord Kitchin on this issue, holds in his concurring judgment that the same result can be reached more simply by holding that the position adopted by Dr Lehtimäki would constitute a threatened breach of fiduciary duty on his part (“the breach of duty route”). In the Chancellor’s judgment, that position was one of “studied neutrality” (para 121), and posed “too great a risk for the court to allow the final decision to be taken by Dr Lehtimäki without guidance from the court” (para 153). With respect to my colleagues, I consider that the court cannot take jurisdiction over Dr Lehtimäki by that route: for my reasons, see paras 174 to 199 below. Accordingly, in this section of my judgment, I confine my attention to the non-intervention principle, which I consider to be the correct principle to apply.</a></p>

Breach of duty is essential (in the full sense of that word) because it is only a breach of duty on the part of the trustees that entitles the court to intervene (apart from the special case of powers of maintenance of minor beneficiaries, where the court was in the past more interventionist: see para 64 above). It is not enough to show that the trustees’ deliberations have fallen short of the highest possible standards, or that the court would, on a surrender of discretion by the trustees, have acted in a different way. Apart from exceptional circumstances (such as an impasse reached by honest and reasonable trustees) only breach of fiduciary duty justifies judicial intervention.”</span></p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para122">“88.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on this part of the case, there is the submission that the trustees’ duty to take account of relevant considerations is to be interpreted as a duty to act on advice only if it is correct - in effect, a duty to come to the right conclusion in every case. I have left this submission until the end because it is to my mind truly a last-ditch argument. It involves taking the principle of strict liability for ultra vires acts (paras 81-84 above) out of context and applying it in a different area, so as to require trustees to show infallibility of judgment. Such a requirement is quite unrealistic. It would tip the balance much too far in making beneficiaries a special favoured class, at the expense of both legal certainty and fairness. It is contrary to the well-known saying of Lord Truro LC in <i>In re Beloved Wilkes’s Charity</i> (1851) 3 Mac &amp; G 440, </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1851/375.pdf">42 ER 330</a>, 448:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘that in such cases as I have mentioned it is to the discretion of the trustees that the execution of the trust is confided, that discretion being exercised with an entire absence of indirect motive, with honesty of intention, and with a fair consideration of the subject. The duty of supervision on the part of this court will thus be confined to the question of the honesty, integrity, and fairness with which the deliberation has been conducted, and will not be extended to the accuracy of the conclusion arrived at, except in particular cases.’</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The trustees’ duty does not extend to being right (‘the accuracy of the conclusion arrived at’) on every occasion. The ‘particular cases’ that Lord Truro LC had in mind may have included cases concerned with the maintenance of minor beneficiaries. They may also have included cases (such as <i>Kerr v British Leyland (Staff) Trustees Ltd </i>[2001] WTLR 1071) in which the trustees have to make a particular factual judgment, rather than exercise a wide discretion.”</p>

Lord Pannick cited several examples of this and further examples were cited by Mr Pearce, including examples from the judgment of Lord Walker: for example, paras 64, 74 and 75. In those circumstances I do not read Lord Walker as excluding the possibility of intervention in cases other than breach of duty (or scheme) if the circumstances attain a sufficient level of exceptionality and seriousness. In my judgment, these exceptional cases have special resonance in the law of charities, and it is unnecessary for me to cite all the examples we were given. Before leaving Lord Truro LC, I note that his formulation does not contain any equivalent of the “manifestly unfit” test used in relation to nominations. There is on his formulation no test of perversity, at most a requirement for fairness and fair consideration of the matter.</a></p><a name="para123">

This was clearly seen as a very delicate matter and the Board invoked the broad general principle that the duty of the court was to execute trusts, being guided principally by the welfare of the beneficiaries. The Board considered that it was probably not possible to lay down any more definite rule than that. The Board considered on the complex facts of that case that the continuance of the trustees would prevent the trust from being properly executed. The useful point which I derive from this case is the reminder that it is the duty of the court to see that a trust is executed. I start from the basis, which is not challenged, that it has been decided that it is in the best interests of the charity to make the Grant, and that seen from that perspective if Dr Lehtimäki were to vote against the section 217 resolution, the achievement of what is the best interests of the charity would be impeded.</p>

Mr Morpuss submits that either this case was wrongly decided or the Court of Appeal did consider that there had been a breach of trust because the trustee failed to consider all the relevant matters. In my judgment, it is clear from the passage cited that Lindley LJ was proceeding on the basis that there was no breach of trust, and that the Court of Appeal took the view that it should intervene because of the unjust consequences to the other beneficiaries.

The trustees have surrendered their discretion to the court and the court has made a decision that a particular transaction which the board supports is in the best interests of the charity and should be put into effect. The second organ wishes to make its own decision independently of the board. It only has a right to vote on one element of the transaction by virtue of section 217 of the 2006 Act. Under the terms of the second organ’s agreement with CIFF the necessary power is otherwise vested in the first organ. It would be reasonable for a member of a commercial company to treat his voting power as a veto on the transaction and to use it as a bargaining counter, but CIFF is not a commercial company but a charitable company and Dr Lehtimäki is a fiduciary and bound to act in this matter for the single-minded purpose of promoting the charitable objects.</a></p><a name="para130">

In that case, the court was asked to give a direction, but it required the consent of a second person <i>by the terms of the Royal Charter constituting the charity</i>. It is quite clear that the objection which Chitty J saw to the making of the order was the fact that the governors were given power to administer the charity (following a compromise of earlier disputes) by the Royal Charter of Edward VI for he held at p 888:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I hold that it is beyond the jurisdiction of the court to sanction the Attorney General’s scheme in the face of the opposition of the existing governing body. Their title is founded on Royal Charter, and is established by Act of Parliament. To whatever lengths the court may have gone, it has never assumed legislative authority; it has never by a stroke of the pen at one and the same time revoked a Royal Charter and repealed an Act of Parliament. It has never ousted from its rights of administering the charitable trusts such a body as the present governors against their will, and that, too, in a case where no breach of trust is charged.

In the cases where the court is not precluded by statute, the court can, if on the application of the trustees it has decided that a particular transaction is in the best interests of the charity, make a consequential direction against not simply the applicants but also any other organ of the charity, which would clearly include the members in the case of a charity. <a name="_Hlk37232590">As the Chancellor put it in this case, “<span style="color:#212121">the members of CIFF do not stand outside the charity; they are part of the administration of the charity, and they cannot lay claim to any private interest” (para 145). </span></a>So, the court as entitled to make a direction against the organ which made the application as it is against any other organ whose consent is required, though that other organ would have of course first to be given an opportunity to be heard, as Dr Lehtimäki was in this case.</p>

In addition, as I have shown above, the courts have always leaned in favour of giving special treatment to charities.</a></p><a name="para135">

(This is recorded by Chitty J in the course of his judgment in the <i>Christ’s Hospital</i> case, although there was no failure of the charitable objects in that case, and see for example <i>Andrews v McGuffog</i> (1886) 11 App Cas 313.)</a></p><a name="para136">

In the particular circumstances of this case, I consider that the Chancellor was entitled to conclude that this was one of the cases in which the court can exceptionally intervene irrespective of any breach of duty, alleged or found, by any fiduciary. That is because an impasse is threatened in the performance of the trust if Dr Lehtimäki is unable to reach the same conclusion as the Chancellor has done. If he does that, the Grant cannot be made even though the arrangements which have led to the proposal for that Grant provided the means for settling an existential threat to the operation of the charity caused by deeply felt dissension between its two founders.</a></p><a name="para137">

It only applies when the continued membership of the member is harmful to the charity and provision is made for the member to make written representations.

Section 20(2) applies to the Charity Commission. Section 20 (</a><a name="_Hlk47510953">as amended by sections 6(3) and 7(3) of the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Act 2016) provides:</a></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidental powers</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission may do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the performance of any of its functions or general duties.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nothing in this Act authorises the Commission -</p>

A member is not a “charity trustee” as defined in the 2011 Act. Section 177 of the 2011 Act states that, unless the context otherwise requires (which has not been suggested), the expression “charity trustees” means “the persons having the general control and management of the administration of the charity”. The members of CIFF do not have general control of the activities of CIFF for the reasons discussed in para 14 above, and so subsection (2)(a) is not engaged by the Chancellor’s direction. In the light of my other conclusions, I need not consider the question whether the direction to Dr Lehtimäki that he is to vote on the section 217 resolution in favour of it requires the performance of an act within the administration of a charity.</a></p><a name="para141">

What Mr Morpuss contends is that the court cannot have any wider jurisdiction than the Charity Commission in this regard and so the court cannot make an order compelling a member to vote in a particular way. In my judgment, the court’s inherent jurisdiction is not tailored to that of the Charity Commission. The jurisdiction of the court with respect to charities is of ancient origin and there is no provision in the 2011 Act which attempts to codify it. It would, as Lord Pannick points out, require an express provision to remove or reduce the scope of the court’s inherent jurisdiction: see <i>In re S (an infant)</i> [1965] 1 WLR 483. There is no such express provision in either the 2011 Act or the 2006 Act which modifies the inherent jurisdiction engaged in this case.</a></p><a name="para142">

It is said by the first and fourth respondents that to give the relief sought the court is restricted to making a scheme. Both Mr Morpuss and Mr Crow make the point that Ms Cooper has been unable to find a previous case in which the court, in reliance on its jurisdiction over trusts, has ordered a fiduciary to cast his vote at a company meeting as the Chancellor did in this case.</a></p><a name="para143">

The facts and circumstances of this case are most unusual. Moreover, <i>ubi jus ibi remedium </i>is one of the maxims of equity and certainly examples can be found where the courts have made directions as consequential relief in charity cases: see, for example, <i>Attorney General v Black</i> (1805) 11 Ves Jr 191; </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1805/248.pdf">32 ER 1061</a>, where Lord Eldon, having decided that the election of a master of a free school had not been carried out in accordance with the terms of the trusts, continued the appointment of acting master until proper elections could be held, which was obviously a necessary and expedient intervention by the court. But there are more modern authorities on this point.</p>

He submits that the jurisdiction of the court in respect of charities enables the court, when it is necessary or expedient in the interests of the charity, to direct the holder of a fiduciary power exercisable in respect of the charity’s property as to how to exercise that power. He also submits, but in my judgment the wording is not beyond argument, that the Chancellor found it necessary that the court should intervene because he held:</a></p><a name="para145"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the only remaining voting member of CIFF must be directed to approve it, otherwise the essential interests of charity which the court is there to protect would be put at risk.” (para 155)</p>

The latter is far wider than the former. It is ancient in origin and is the way in which the prerogative of the Crown as <i>parens patriae</i> is exercised in the case of charities.</a></p><a name="para146">

There was no allegation of any misconduct by the trustee. Later examples include <i>In re Randall</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1888/33.html">(1888) 38 Ch D 213</a>, where a limited gift to charity had come to an end (citing <i>Walsh v Secretary of State for India </i>(1863) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1863/562.pdf">10 HL Cas 367</a>, concerning the destination following the Indian mutiny of a trust fund established by Lord Clive of India for the East India Company’s militia). In the context of charities, the court is not in a case such as this seeking to execute the trust “in the manner best calculated to give effect to the settlor’s or testator’s intentions” (see per Lord Wilberforce above) but in the manner most likely to advance the charitable purposes for public benefit.</p>

A charitable company is only in a position analogous to that of a trustee, but it is now well-established that the court’s jurisdiction with respect to charities extends to institutions which are not trusts in the strict, technical sense of the word (see the comments of Slade J in the <i>Liverpool and District </i>case [1981] Ch 193, 214; see also the <i>Construction Industry Training Board </i>case [1973] Ch 173). (It is to be noted that the scheme in the <i>Liverpool and District</i> case would not have involved any change to the company’s constitution as the company was in liquidation and its assets were held on the statutory trusts for distribution).

By analogy with public law (and charities operated within the realm of public law - see <i>Stanway</i> above, para 91), the court should defer to the decision of the decision-maker chosen by Parliament. An inherent jurisdiction is not an unlimited jurisdiction. The court intervenes to approve matters which the fiduciaries wished to do: see, for example, <i>In re Ashton Charity</i>. In any event, policy supports the non-intervention principle because (1) members are better informed than the court, (2) it is important not to discourage donors who were potential members, (3) there is likely to be an increase in charity litigation if there is more intervention, (4) the court should by analogy with public law defer to the decision of the decision-maker chosen by Parliament.

The original prohibition, as originally enacted, applied only to directors but the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Law Commission of Scotland recommended that it should be extended to payments to connected persons in their report, <i>Company Directors: Regulating Conflicts of Interest and Formulating a Statement of Duties</i> (1999) (Law Com No 261; Scot Law Com No 173, paras 7.31 to 7.37).

The House of Lords considered in <i>Bushell v Faith</i> [1970] AC 1099 that the mandatory rule in section 184 of the Companies Act 1948 (now section 168 of the 2006 Act), whose purpose was to prevent companies from making removal of a director subject to an extraordinary resolution, did not prevent special voting rights being attached to a particular share on any ordinary resolution for the removal of a director. In that case, the House of Lords by a majority held that the article attaching special voting rights was valid despite the provisions of section 184(1), since Parliament was only seeking to make an ordinary resolution sufficient to remove a director and had not sought to fetter a company’s right to issue a share with such rights or restrictions as it thought fit.</a></p><a name="para160">

In those circumstances the field for the operation of public law in this case is exhausted. The section 217 resolution becomes a matter of the internal management of the company.

The 2011 Act and the 2006 Act are both primary legislation and thus my provisional view (as this point has not been fully argued) is that, under the law currently in force and in the absence of an order by a court having power to make the necessary change itself, a charitable company must follow the procedures in the 2006 Act if it proposes to alter its constitution or take any other step for which a procedure is prescribed by the 2006 Act, and that Mr Morpuss’ submission about section 201 would appear to be correct.</a></p>

Of course, the law applies in the same way whether a fiduciary has Dr Lehtimäki’s knowledge and skills or not.

The court must look at all the circumstances and the full context of the potential exercise of discretion. In that regard, the question is not only what Parliament intended in enacting section 217 of the 2006 Act but also what the settlors intended in establishing a charity which gave members only a subsidiary role. Looking for the intention of the settlors as expressed in the structure which they established, it seems to me unlikely that they intended in a case such as the present that members should prevent the charitable purposes from being performed and their beneficiaries safeguarded as a result of reaching a different view from the court, exercising the discretion of the trustees, on the question of the Grant.</a></p><a name="para173"> </a><h1 style="text-align:justify"><a name="para173"></a><a name="_Toc46838307">WOULD THE COURT HAVE JURISDICTION TO DIRECT DR LEHTIMÄKI TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THE SECTION 217 RESOLUTION ON THE BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ROUTE?</a></h1> <h2 style="margin-left:36.0pt"><a name="_Toc46838308">Lord Briggs’ concurring judgment on the breach of duty route</a></h2>

Although the ordinary duty of a fiduciary is to “exercise the powers that he has in that capacity in the way that he decides, in good faith, would be most likely to further the purposes of CIFF”, that power has “to give way” (para 218), and, once the court has given its approval, “there can be no reasonable basis for a fiduciary acting contrary to that decision” (para 232). “The duty of the fiduciary is then to use his powers so as to give effect to the court’s decision …” (para 218). In Lord Briggs’ judgment, there is “no longer any legitimate debate” on the question that the court has decided (para 218). Lord Briggs considers that the member’s only option if he cannot vote for the section 217 resolution is to resign (para 218). Moreover, while Parliament has imposed constraints on the trustees’ exercise of their powers in section 217 of the 2006 Act and section 201 of the 2011 Act, those constraints do not serve the same purpose where the court makes that decision in place of the trustees (paras 209 and 210), and so the members can be directed how to vote by the court. Dr Lehtimäki ceases to be “entitled under section 217 to overrule the trustee directors” (para 221). In contrast, my conclusion is that a direction should be made by way of an exception to the non-intervention principle based on the exceptional circumstances of this case.</a></p><a name="para175"> </a><h2><a name="para175"></a><a name="_Toc46838309">The views of the Chancellor and of the Court of Appeal</a></h2>

As I have explained above, the Chancellor accepted that another fiduciary acting reasonably could reach a different conclusion from his own (para 135: “I am not saying that no reasonable trustee or fiduciary could disagree with my view ...”) but then went on to hold that, once the court has made its decision, the member no longer had a free vote and would be acting in breach of duty if he acted contrary to the court’s decision.

The Chancellor made Dr Lehtimäki a party to the proceedings but that does not alter the nature of the application or enlarge the court’s jurisdiction (cf para 227 of Lord Briggs’ judgment). Dr Lehtimäki chose not to surrender his discretion to the court and the trustees had no power to surrender his discretion for him. On that the position in this court remains the same as it was before the Chancellor. When the court exercises a discretion surrendered to it, it acts in the place of the trustees and the surrender confers no power on the court which the trustees themselves did not have: see <i>Lewin on Trusts</i>, 20th ed (2020), para 39-099.</a></p><a name="para181">

Lord Briggs explains that when the Grant is approved Dr Lehtimäki’s duty is transformed from one under which he is bound to act in what he considers to be the best interests of the charity to one under which he has no discretion but to vote to approve the Grant. The Chancellor made a mandatory order against him to that effect. But the order approving the Grant could not alter his powers in that way. If the required transformation can be achieved at all, despite the fact that Dr Lehtimäki was intending to exercise his powers in a proper manner, it could not be done by an order exercising the trustees’ discretion: see <i>Lewin on Trusts</i>, above. It could only be done by making a separate substantive order to that effect against Dr Lehtimäki changing his subjective duty into one to vote to give effect to the court’s decision.</a></p><a name="para182">

Jurisdiction must be established in substance before the direction is given, it is not enough for the court to found jurisdiction on a breach of duty which does not arise unless the court has jurisdiction to make the order. To do otherwise is, with respect, circular. Therefore, as I analyse it, the breach of duty route cannot be followed because there is no jurisdiction. The court must first establish jurisdiction by finding, if it properly can, an exception to the non-intervention principle. That may explain why counsel made detailed submissions on this principle to almost the complete exclusion of the breach of duty route.</a></p><a name="para183"> </a><h2><a name="para183"></a><a name="_Toc46838312">The court’s approval may be frustrated by the action of non-fiduciaries</a></h2>

In my judgment, the Charity Commission as a public body cannot be bound to reach its decision on what is expedient in the interests of the charity by virtue of the decision which the court has made on the trustees’ application. The Charity Commission must make its own decision on the materials available to it though no doubt it would take into account the court’s decision.

Once it is appreciated that the Charity Commission and the holder of any non-fiduciary power to give consent is not bound by the order made on the trustees’ surrender of their discretion to the court, a more nuanced view of the position can be taken and the conclusion reached that there is no absolute need for a member of a charitable company to have his discretion taken away from him. Even if he is bound to act reasonably, there can, as is demonstrated by the judgment of the Chancellor in this case, be a reasonable difference of judgment on the exercise of a discretion.</a></p><a name="para186"> </a><h2><a name="para186"></a><a name="_Toc46838314">The importance of the subjective test for breach of fiduciary duty</a></h2>

The court does not interfere in a dispute as to how a charity is to be administered: see paras 120-122 above. The non-intervention principle reflects the judicial policy of not interfering with the acts or decisions of trustees in the absence of evidence of a breach of duty. As explained, any departure from the non-intervention principle calls for caution.</a></p><a name="para187">

Thus, for example (and remembering that I have not concluded that there is any threatened or actual breach of duty by Dr Lehtimäki: see further para 195 below), the law looks benevolently on charity trustees even where there is evidence of actual or potential breach of duty: see, for example, the judgment of Lord Eldon in<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> </span><i>Attorney General v Exeter Corpn</i> (1826)  </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/856.pdf">2 Russ 45</a>, 54 (approved by the House of Lords in in <i>Andrews v McGuffog</i> 11 App Cas 313, 324) as follows:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“With respect to the general principle on which the court deals with trustees of a charity, though it holds a strict hand over them, when there is wilful misapplication, it will not press severely upon them, where it sees nothing but mistake. It often happens, from the nature of the instruments creating the trust, that there is great difficulty in determining how the funds of a charity ought to be administered. If the administration of the funds, though mistaken, has been honest, and unconnected with any corrupt purpose, the court, while it directs for the future, refuses to visit with punishment what has been done in time past. To act on any other principle would be to deter all prudent persons from becoming trustees of charities.”</p>

Lord Eldon explains that the reason for the court’s benevolence is to encourage people to become trustees of charities. Another reason would also be that it may give donors to charities confidence that their generous, and in this case, massive, donations for public benefit will be managed and applied as the officers and, in the case of a membership charity like CIFF, its members think fit in accordance with the law and the constitution of the charity, and not by the court. The court may not have the same detailed experience and knowledge of the charity as the officers and members have. The Court of Appeal expressed similar views to those in this paragraph in para 63 of its judgment when agreeing with a submission by Mr Robert Ham QC, then appearing for Sir Christopher.</a></p><a name="para189"> </a><h2><a name="para189"></a><a name="_Toc46838315">Importance of my more nuanced approach in membership charities</a></h2>

As already indicated, this is contrary to the ethos of a membership charity. The court may not be aware of their reasons on a particular proposal of the charity trustees, especially if the members are drawn from a wide section of the public. Society draws enormous strength and benefit from charities of this kind, and that factor should in my judgment incline the court to hold that jurisdiction can only be founded in this case if there is an applicable exception to the non-intervention principle.

In those cases, the court has only a single body of fiduciaries before it. In this case, there are two: (i) the trustees and (ii) the members of CIFF. As a matter of corporate law, the trustees do not control the members’ powers (see para 14 above). In any event, the cases on deadlock form an exception to the non-intervention principle (see per Lord Walker in <i>Pitt v Holt</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/26.html">[2013] 2 AC 108</a>, para 73, cited at para 121 above).</p> <h2 style="text-align:justify"><a name="_Toc46838317">A material change of circumstances would undermine the basis on which the direction has been made</a></h2>

An important consequence is that it may turn out that in the event there is no breach of duty by the time the member comes to vote. A change of circumstances could occur at any time before the date on which Dr Lehtimäki has to vote on the section 217 resolution, which is the material time for assessing the existence of a breach of his duty.</a></p><a name="para194">

Rather, it should satisfy itself that it is justified in concluding that there is an appropriate exception to the non-intervention principle. That is the principled way to ensure that a member cannot exercise a veto on the court’s approval of the Grant.</a></p><a name="para196">

Lord Briggs’ response is that the test has to be objective in these circumstances. But the effect of that approach is to make a fundamental change in the member’s duty. It also involves taking away the member’s discretion: in the words of the Chancellor’s judgment, at para 154, “the member does not have a free vote in this case”, and so he is no longer free to exercise his voting rights as he thinks fit in the proper performance of his duties.</a></p><a name="para197">

In my judgment, the broader consequence in membership charities is to tip the balance of power in favour of the trustees and/or the court, and against the membership. The members who take a different view from the court will be compelled to return to the court to justify their approach. The onus should not be on them to do so. The core facts of this case are not necessarily “very unusual”: it is not infrequent to find disagreements between the trustees and members of substantial and well-known membership charities. Accordingly, in my judgment, to hold that members are automatically bound by the court’s decision in relation to the trustees is the wrong turn for charity law to take.</a></p><a name="para198">

The fiduciary duties are tailored to fit within the corporate vehicle, and thus Dr Lehtimäki has no greater right to demand information from the trustees (the directors) than the terms of the company’s constitution or the general law relating to companies allows a member. I also consider that the duties are narrower than those formulated by the Court of Appeal so that they do not apply in every instance where a member has power to act. Those circumstances must be worked out as and when they arise.</a></p><a name="para200">

Any departure from this principle must be approached with considerable caution by the court. Litigation which simply seeks to draw the court into matters which can be dealt with by the trustees under their powers is not to be encouraged, but litigants must in any event overcome the hurdles to bringing charity proceedings to which I have referred in para 50. However, in my judgment, the present case is a rare exception to that principle. The trustees of CIFF have surrendered their discretion to the court and the court’s priority is to see that fiduciaries for the charity perform their duties in the way most likely to achieve its continued existence notwithstanding what has been held to be in effect an existential threat to the proper governance of the charity. I also consider that the court has jurisdiction to give a direction to Dr Lehtimäki to vote in favour of the section 217 resolution, and that there does not have to be a scheme.</a></p><a name="para201">

However, differing here from Lord Briggs, I would reject the breach of duty route, that is, the view that the court can found its jurisdiction to make this order against a member on the basis that for a member to threaten to vote other than in favour of the section 217 resolution would be a breach of duty by the member simply because the court has reached the conclusion that the Grant should be approved on the trustees’ application (paras 174 to 199 above).</a></p><a name="para203">

I add a few words of my own first because there is in my view a simple although unusual reason why it was right for the Chancellor to direct Dr Lehtimӓki how to cast his vote under section 217 which depends upon no deep consideration of the law of trusts and charities of the type which both the parties and my Lady have considered it necessary to undertake.</a></p><a name="para205">

Like a charitable trust CIFF is only a charity because its objects (ie its purposes) as laid down by its constitution are exclusively charitable. The furtherance of those purposes is entrusted primarily to its trustees. Although their functions are in most respects indistinguishable from those of company directors, like other charitable trustees they have the power to surrender to the court the exercise of their fiduciary discretion about a particular matter, a surrender which the court may or may not accept. If (as here) the court accepts that surrender, it will exercise that discretion in accordance with what it considers will best further the charitable purposes of the company, after hearing evidence and submissions from interested parties and from HM Attorney General representing the Crown as <i>parens patriae</i>.</a></p><a name="para206">

If the court concludes that it is, then it will follow that those purposes will not best be furthered by that transaction not going ahead. The court’s decision on this question may be (and was in this case) a very difficult one, about which reasonable minds, activated by nothing less than the loyal performance of a fiduciary duty, may well differ.</a></p><a name="para207">

It ceases to be a question for debate. It is binding on all those interested parties joined to the relevant proceedings, and the duty of the charity’s fiduciaries (whether or not joined as parties) is to use their powers to the end that it is implemented, both generally and in accordance with any directions which the court may give for that purpose. It would in my view be a plain breach of fiduciary duty for a relevant fiduciary of the charity to do otherwise, a fortiori to exercise a fiduciary power so as in effect to veto the very transaction which the court has decided should proceed in furtherance of the charity’s purposes.</a></p><a name="para208">

Section 201 of the Charities Act 2011 requires that, in addition, the payment element be approved by the Charity Commission where the relevant company is a charity. Section 217 recognises the need for an ordinary company’s main stakeholders to have a veto over the ability of its directors to make payments to themselves or to one of their number from the company’s funds. Section 201 recognises that the Commission, as the representative of the public for this purpose, should have the same ultimate control over such payments out of the funds of a charity. Both these sections recognise the obvious risk that directors may be swayed by inappropriate motives in deciding upon such payments, even when the intended recipients abstain entirely from the decision-making process.</a></p><a name="para209">

The court will not be affected by fellow feeling of the type which might affect the directors or trustees. If the court gets the decision wrong, there is an appellate process in place to put it right. It is common ground that the Charity Commission may defer to the court under section 201 in such a case. It would be most unlikely if (as in the present case) the Charity Commission had authorised proceedings designed to enable the court rather than the trustees to make the decision that it would then decline to consent to a transaction which the court had approved, as being in furtherance of the purposes of the charity. But the same goes, or ought to go, for the members of a charitable company under section 217 if, as here, they are pure fiduciaries with no proprietary or other separate stake of their own in the company’s assets. That is not to say that a section 217 resolution becomes unnecessary, but only that the members, if fiduciaries, can be directed by the court to approve it, if they are minded to do otherwise. Nor would approval by the Charity Commission become unnecessary, but in the absence of something having gone badly wrong with the court proceedings, it is hard to conceive why it would be withheld.</a></p><a name="para210">

The management of CIFF was gravely threatened by the most unfortunate falling out between its generous and dedicated founders, Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper. What became the Grant (as Lady Arden describes) was thrashed out as a way of dealing with that threat in a way which would effect a form of demerger of CIFF’s funds and activities into two charities, CIFF and Big Win Philanthropy (“BWP”), each with the same (though differently worded) objects as CIFF, the latter to be managed by Ms Cooper who would withdraw from CIFF, with its funds augmented by further substantial donations from both Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper.</a></p><a name="para211">

The latter two were, along with Dr Lehtimӓki, the only members of CIFF. For perfectly understandable reasons the trustees considered it appropriate to surrender to the court their discretion whether to commit CIFF to the making of the Grant, and the Charity Commission deferred to the court by authorising the proceedings. But the Grant included what was, strictly, a payment for loss of office within section 217, and therefore required the approval of the members of CIFF. Again for understandable reasons, Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper declined to participate in voting as members. So the question whether to vote in favour of the making of the Grant fell upon the shoulders of Dr Lehtimӓki.</a></p><a name="para212">

The Charity Commission understandably took no active part itself. The Chancellor decided that the making of the Grant was in the best interests of CIFF; ie that its charitable purposes would be better advanced by the making of the Grant than by its not being made. He found that a difficult decision, about which relevant fiduciaries, including in particular Dr Lehtimӓki, could reasonably differ without thereby being in breach of duty. But there has been no challenge to that decision.</a></p><a name="para213">

Speaking of Dr Lehtimӓki he said, at para 154:</a></p><a name="para214"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The member does not have a free vote in this case because he is bound by the fiduciary duties I have described and is subject to the court’s inherent jurisdiction over the administration of charities.

The first is the submission that Dr Lehtimӓki is not, as a member of CIFF, a fiduciary at all, although it may be conceded that he was bound by the “proper purpose” rule, that is to exercise his section 217 power for the purpose for which it was given. On this issue I agree with the Chancellor, the Court of Appeal and with Lady Arden that Dr Lehtimӓki is a fiduciary, in particular in relation to the exercise of his power as a member of CIFF to approve or disapprove the making of the Grant. There may be slight differences in emphasis and detail in their reasoning, particularly in relation to the question whether the members of mass membership charities like the National Trust are fiduciaries and, if not, why not. Like Lady Arden I would prefer to leave these issues to a case where they might affect the outcome. In the case of CIFF, its constitution confers no particular benefits on its members which would bring that question into play.</a></p><a name="para215"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para215"></a><a name="para216">216.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second, and main, ground is what is loosely described as the “non-intervention principle”, namely that the court will not generally interfere with the performance by fiduciaries of their duties unless they are acting, or threatening to act, in breach of duty, or have surrendered their discretion, and that the court’s special jurisdiction over charities gives rise to no exception. It was the main ground upon which the Court of Appeal overturned the Chancellor’s direction to Dr Lehtimӓki as to how he should vote upon the necessary section 217 resolution. Lady Arden deals with this ground on the assumption that Dr Lehtimӓki’s stance involved neither a breach nor a threatened breach of his fiduciary duty. On that basis she concludes that the non-intervention principle, important though it undoubtedly is, cannot be without exception, either in the law of trusts or a fortiori<i> </i>in relation to charities and that this case is, on its very unusual facts, just such an exception. In particular she concludes, and I agree, that the court’s jurisdiction to intervene in the affairs of charities extends beyond its trusts jurisdiction more widely than just in relation to schemes.</a></p><a name="para216"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para216"></a><a name="para217">217.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it were necessary to proceed upon the basis that Dr Lehtimӓki was neither committing nor threatening a breach of his fiduciary duty by declining to vote on the section 217 resolution in accordance with the court’s decision that the making of the Grant furthered the charitable purposes of CIFF, then I would agree both with Lady Arden’s conclusion and with her analysis. But I am unable to accept the premise. I shall assume in Dr Lehtimӓki’s favour that, as the Chancellor said, a conclusion by him that the making of the Grant was not in the best interests of CIFF, and a vote against it under section 217, would not <i>in the absence of the court’s decision on the point</i> have involved any breach of fiduciary duty on his part. Thus if for example the trustees had resolved that the Grant should be made (on their perception that to do so would be in the furtherance of CIFF’s charitable objects) without seeking the assistance of the court it would have been perfectly consistent with his fiduciary duty as a member to consider the matter afresh and, if he concluded otherwise, to prevent the making of the Grant by voting against it as the only unconflicted member. It is plainly within the intent of section 217 (which Parliament clearly intended should apply with full force to charitable companies) that the members may overrule the trustee directors in the event of a bona fide disagreement of that kind, where (as here) the transaction in question includes a relevant payment for loss of office.</a></p><a name="para217"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para217"></a><a name="para218">218.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But once the court has ruled upon the underlying common question whether the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the charity, in properly constituted proceedings in which both the company and the members are joined as parties, the position fundamentally changes. It may well be that particular fiduciary organs of the charity bona fide opposed and argued against the decision which the court reached and remained unconvinced by the court’s reasoning. But there comes a point where the ordinary subjective duty of the fiduciary (as the Court of Appeal put it at para 48) to “exercise the powers that he has in that capacity in the way that <i>he</i> decides, in good faith, would be most likely to further the purposes of CIFF” has to give way, where the court has reached a different view from his own and made a final decision to that effect. This is because the concept that the fiduciary is entitled to form his own subjective judgment about a matter affecting (in this case) the company assumes that there are different conclusions about the matter which may reasonably be reached. But when the very question in issue has been finally decided by the court in proceedings in which the fiduciary has been joined as a party and been heard, then there is no longer any legitimate debate. The duty of the fiduciary is then to use his powers so as to give effect to the court’s decision about the company’s best interests, however much he may disagree with it. If he finds that he cannot in conscience do so, then he should resign.</a></p><a name="para218"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para218"></a><a name="para219">219.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a useful parallel in the situation which arises where trustees who have to act unanimously in deciding whether or how to exercise a fiduciary power find themselves deadlocked and, exceptionally, the court needs to resolve that deadlock in order to enable the trust to be duly administered. The court may be called upon to do so by one or more of the trustees, without a surrender of discretion by all of them, or indeed on the application of any interested party, such as a beneficiary. The opposing sides among the trustees may each have perfectly reasonable and bona fide views about whether the exercise, or non-exercise, of the relevant power would best serve the interests of the beneficiaries. Where in such a case the court chooses to decide whether or how the power should be exercised, in the best interests of the beneficiaries, then it becomes the duty of all the trustees to act in accordance with the court’s decision, regardless whether they agree with the court’s view about the merits of the matter. </a><a name="_Hlk37932432">If necessary the court may direct them to do so. </a>For a useful summary of English and Commonwealth authorities on this aspect of the court’s jurisdiction in the administration of trusts, see <i>Garnham v PC</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/je/cases/UR/2012/2012_050.html">[2012] JRC 050</a>.</p>

It is said that his joinder as a party, otherwise than at his request, does not detract from that entitlement. I respectfully disagree, for the following reasons.</a></p><a name="para220"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para220"></a><a name="para221">221.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the court was not merely resolving some internal disagreement among the trustees. It was at the trustees’ unanimous request making the decision about the merits of the Grant for the company itself, exercising for that purpose its inherent jurisdiction in relation to the administration of the company as a charity, with the consent of the Charity Commission. CIFF was, in recognition of that, joined as a party, for the purpose of being bound by the outcome. As the organ charged with the overall direction and management of CIFF the trustees were beyond question the appropriate body within CIFF to put that question before the court on CIFF’s behalf. While it is true that this is not a case of deadlock (because the members are, in respect of proposed payments for loss of office, entitled under section 217 to overrule the trustee directors), the court became seized of the issue as to the merits of the Grant by a legitimate alternative route.</a></p><a name="para221"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para221"></a><a name="para222">222.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the underlying question whether the making of the Grant was in furtherance of CIFF’s charitable purposes was the determinative question for both the trustees and for the members, although they were different fiduciary organs of the company. This is not a case (as it would usually be in the case of an ordinary commercial company with non-fiduciary members) where the two organs might legitimately have a different agenda from each other. There is no sense in which it could be said that Dr Lehtimӓki as a member might legitimately bring different objectives into his decision making, from those actuating the trustees. For both of them, the decisive question was the same: would the making of the Grant further the charitable purposes of CIFF? If it would, then they both had a duty to see that it happened.</a></p><a name="para222"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para222"></a><a name="para223">223.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly the court was astute to make CIFF’s members, and Dr Lehtimӓki in particular, parties to the proceedings, both to obtain their assistance in the making of a difficult decision, in the form of evidence and submissions, and to bind them into the outcome.</a></p><a name="para223"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para223"></a><a name="para224">224.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is in my view nothing to the point that Parliament has by section 217 given the members of a company their own decisive say in relation to the making of payments for loss of office to directors, and confirmed it in relation to charitable companies in which the members will usually be fiduciaries. The members’ decisive role is given to them as a control upon what would otherwise be the uncontrolled discretionary power of the directors (here the trustees). It was no part of Parliament’s purpose to give fiduciary members of a charitable company the like control over the court’s exercise of power over the company under its jurisdiction in relation to charities. That does not mean that section 217 was thereby disapplied, or for that matter the requirement for the approval of the transaction by the Charity Commission under section 201 of the 2011 Act, as the Chancellor recognised by the terms of his order.</a></p><a name="para224"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para224"></a><a name="para225">225.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lady Arden was kind enough to read a draft of my judgment, which ended at para 224 above. She has, in paras 174 and following of her judgment set out at length why she disagrees with the breach of duty route. I must explain why I have not been persuaded by her analysis. I mean no disrespect by doing so briefly.</a></p><a name="para225"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para225"></a><a name="para226">226.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First however, I acknowledge the awkwardness of a point which asserts a threatened breach of duty when this was not in the forefront of the arguments which the court heard. But this is a really important point: can a fiduciary whose duty is to further the purposes of a charity stand aloof from a final decision of the court, made for the charity, on that very point, in proceedings in which he had been both joined and heard, so as to exercise a veto over what the court has decided would best further those purposes, or would it be a breach of duty to do so? I have not been persuaded by Lady Arden’s reasons for not affirming the judge’s conclusion that such conduct would be a breach.</a></p><a name="para226"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para226"></a><a name="para227">227.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lady Arden says (at paras 178 and 181) that she prefers the submission of Mr Morpuss that the court had no jurisdiction over Dr Lehtimӓki as a member merely because it had accepted a surrender of the trustees’ discretion. I agree. But having joined Dr Lehtimӓki, the court’s jurisdiction to require him to vote in favour of the Grant arose because his threat not to do so was a threatened breach of duty.</a></p><a name="para227"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para227"></a><a name="para228">228.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lady Arden acknowledges, at para 178, that the breach of duty point was, albeit briefly, taken on Ms Cooper’s behalf in her Grounds of Appeal. The Court asked Lord Pannick during his opening of the appeal whether he adhered to the argument that Dr Lehtimӓki would be in breach of duty if he voted against the Grant after its approval by the Chancellor and he said, again briefly, that he did. So the point remained to be decided, even though little was thereafter said about it during the hearing.</a></p><a name="para228"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para228"></a><a name="para229">229.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More to the point, as I have sought to explain, the breach of duty point was precisely the basis upon which the Chancellor decided to direct Dr Lehtimӓki to vote in favour of the Grant. True it is that the Court of Appeal disagreed with the Chancellor’s reasoning, but that is why there is an appeal to this court. It must be open to this court on a second appeal to conclude that the first instance judge was right in his analysis, save perhaps where all parties to the appeal are for good (rather than tactical) reasons united in the view that he was wrong. There was no such unanimity in the present case.</a></p><a name="para229"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para229"></a><a name="para230">230.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am unable to agree with Lady Arden’s next point (at paras 184-186), which is that if (as the Chancellor recognised) the Charity Commission retained its power to approve or disapprove the transaction under section 201 of the 2011 Act, then there could be no valid distinction with Dr Lehtimӓki’s power as a member under section 217. First, the Charity Commission is not a fiduciary subject to the court’s general jurisdiction in relation to breach of duty. It is a separate public body with its own statutory jurisdiction. Secondly the Charity Commission was not joined as a party to the proceedings, or heard on the merits of the Grant. The relationship between the court and the Charity Commission is quite different from that between the court and a fiduciary who is also a party to the proceedings, and its detail is beyond the scope of the issues in this appeal. Leaving aside change of circumstances, it seems very unlikely that the Charity Commission would prohibit the making of the Grant by a refusal under section 201, where the court had already finally decided that it would further the purposes of CIFF, and directed Dr Lehtimӓki to vote in favour of it under section 217.</a></p><a name="para230"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para230"></a><a name="para231">231.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lady Arden makes a number of points which may be loosely characterised as suggesting that the breach of duty route would have ramifications adverse to the willingness of members of the public to become engaged in the affairs of charity by becoming donors or members of charitable companies. Thus she says that the decision that Dr Lehtimӓki was threatening a breach of duty would undermine the subjective basis of fiduciary liability, that it would be contrary to the benevolent treatment of charity trustees by the court, that donors would react adversely to the court preferring its own views to those of members and trustees, and that it would discourage membership by shifting the balance of power from the membership to management and the court.</a></p><a name="para231"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para231"></a><a name="para232">232.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that the principled basis upon which the Chancellor decided to direct Dr Lehtimӓki to vote (with which I agree) does involve some limited departure from a purely subjective assessment of the question whether a fiduciary has committed, or is threatening to commit, a breach of duty. But the test for breach of fiduciary duty has never been purely subjective. The fiduciary’s belief has to be both bona fide and reasonable, if he or she is to act upon it without risking breach of duty. In <i>Cowan v Scargill</i> [1985] Ch 270, 289, Sir Robert Megarry V-C said this, of the trustee’s duty in relation to investment:</a></p><a name="para232"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<span style="background:white">This requirement is not discharged merely by showing that the trustee has acted in good faith and with sincerity. Honesty and sincerity are not the same as prudence and reasonableness.”</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Where the court has finally decided what is in the charity’s best interests there can be no reasonable basis for a fiduciary acting contrary to that decision and, here, actually vetoing the transaction which the court has decided best furthers the purposes of the charity.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para232"></a><a name="para233">233.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor can such conduct, in the face of a final decision of the court after hearing full argument, be equated with the type of bona fide mistake referred to by Lord Eldon LC in <i>Attorney General v Exeter Corpn</i>  </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/856.pdf">2 Russ 45</a>. He contemplated that the court would readily give directions as to future conduct by the trustee, but be merciful in relation to punishment for the past. No-one is suggesting that Dr Lehtimӓki should be punished. Nor should anyone be discouraged from becoming a fiduciary for a charity (as a trustee or a member) by the prospect that, in unusually difficult cases like the present, the court may give such directions, in the expectation that they will be complied with. The fact that the court is there to lend its assistance when the fiduciaries are divided, or cannot make up their minds, should be an encouragement to those uncertain whether to undertake what may occasionally be a challenging role.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para234">234.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I fully agree with Lady Arden that membership of corporate charities should be encouraged, and that members should also be encouraged to play their constitutional part in decision making about the charity. But there will, very occasionally, be decisions of great difficulty, sometimes of great controversy, with which the court is there to assist, in its general supervisory role over charity. That this is just such a case is the foundation of Lady Arden’s judgment as much as it is of mine. I do not think that this very unusual case will tend to shift the balance of power away from members towards management and the court. In the present case Dr Lehtimӓki was, by his joinder, encouraged to put his own view of the merits of the Grant before the court, although it was the trustees who placed the matter before the court. In fact the originators of the proposal to make the Grant, Sir Christopher and Ms Cooper, were both members as well as trustees.</a></p><a name="para234">
