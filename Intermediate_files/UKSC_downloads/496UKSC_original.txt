The appellants rely primarily on the duty imposed on the Secretary of State by the Human Rights Act 1998 to act compatibly with the right to respect for family life guaranteed by article 8 of the ECHR. In each case, the Secretary of State concluded that the appellant did not qualify for leave to remain under the applicable provisions of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules ("the Rules"), and that, applying the Immigration Directorate Instructions, "Family Members Under the Immigration Rules, Section FM 1.0, Partner &amp; ECHR Article 8 Guidance" ("the Instructions"), there were no exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.</a></p><a name="para1">

They also raise an issue under EU law, relating to the effect of the judgment of the Court of Justice in  <i>Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l'emploi </i>(Case C-34/09) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C3409.html">[2012] QB 265</a>, as well as some other issues under domestic law.</p>

Decision-making in relation to immigration, as in relation to other areas of government, is not exhaustively regulated by legislation. It involves the exercise of discretion and the making of evaluative judgments. In such a situation, it is usual, and legitimate, for the Secretary of State to adopt administrative policies in order to guide decision-making, and to issue instructions to officials. Unusually, in the context of immigration Parliament has enacted legislation under which it exercises oversight of these aspects of administrative decision-making. Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 requires the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament "statements of the rules, or any changes in the rules, laid down by him as to the practice to be followed in the administration of this Act for regulating the entry into and stay in the United Kingdom of persons required by this Act to have leave to enter". The Rules are subject to Parliamentary approval, and are published as House of Commons papers. Their legal significance was reflected, at the time of the proceedings with which these appeals are concerned, in the fact that an appeal could be brought against an immigration decision on the ground that it was not in accordance with the Rules: Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, section 84(1)(a). Section 86(3) of the 2002 Act also included the Rules in the law to which the tribunal must have regard when determining an appeal.</span></a></p><a name="para3">

The manner in which that discretion is exercised may be the subject of a policy, which may be expressed in guidance to the Secretary of State's officials. The discretion may also be converted into an obligation where the duty of the Secretary of State to act compatibility with Convention rights is applicable.</p>

The Human Rights Act additionally imposed on the Secretary of State a statutory duty not to act incompatibly with Convention rights, including the right guaranteed by article 8. The same duty is also imposed on tribunals and courts considering an appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, but their role does not absolve the Secretary of State of her own duty to act compatibly with Convention rights. Unlike the ECHR itself, which imposes a duty under international law on the United Kingdom as a contracting party, and is therefore not concerned with failures to comply with Convention rights by one organ of the state which are fully corrected by another, the Act imposes a duty on every public authority, subject to specified exceptions. The fact that an act of a public authority may be subject to review by the courts, and therefore does not in itself inevitably result in a breach of the Convention, does not mean that the act cannot be incompatible with Convention rights. Such a reading of the Act would deprive it of most of its content, since virtually all acts of public authorities are susceptible to appeal or review before the courts.

The Secretary of State's initial response to the entry into force of the material provisions of the Human Rights Act in October 2000 was to insert into the Rules a direction to officials to carry out their duties in compliance with the provisions of that Act (rule 2). As the Home Office noted in 2012, however, "there was no change to the family life part of the Rules to reflect any consideration of proportionality under article 8, and there has been no attempt since to align the rules with developing article 8 case law" ( <i>Statement of Intent: Family Migration, </i>Home Office, June 2012). The Rules frequently offered no more than broad guidance as to how discretion was to be exercised in different typical situations. In that situation, it was primarily through the exercise of her residual discretion to deal with cases outside the Rules that the Secretary of State sought to comply with article 8.</span></a></p><a name="para6">

Over time, increasing emphasis has been placed on certainty rather than discretion, on predictability rather than flexibility, on detail rather than broad guidance, and on ease and economy of administration. The increased numbers of applications, the increasing complexity of the system, and the increasing use of modern technology for its administration, have necessitated increasingly detailed Rules and instructions. In some areas, the apparent aim is for the decision-making process to involve as little discretion or judgment as can be achieved consistently with the duty to respect Convention rights. The present context appears to be an example, as explained below.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

At that time, the Rules did not reflect an assessment of the proportionality of decision-making in relation to article 8. In that context, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said at para 6 that the rule under which the appellant failed to qualify for leave to remain was unobjectionable, but that her failure to qualify under the Rules was the point at which to begin, not end, consideration of her claim under article 8.</p>

They could not give due weight to the Government's and Parliament's view, because they did not know what it was (para 37).

It explained that the current rules did not provide a "comprehensive" framework for considering family life, and that "currently family life applications are first considered under the Rules and, if the application does not meet the requirements of the Rules, the decision-maker then considers whether the decision is compatible with A8 [and, if not,] ... leave is granted outside the Rules" (para 3). It acknowledged that this two-stage approach had one advantageous consequence:</span></a></p><a name="para13">  
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">"A policy of keeping proportionality decisions outside of the Rules can be helpful in forming the basis of an argument that the Rules can never be incompatible with the ECHR." (para 16)</p>  
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Statement also noted, however, the serious disadvantages which had flowed from that approach. The approach adopted in  <i>Huang</i>, <i> </i>in requiring the compatibility of individual decisions with article 8 to be considered on a case-by-case basis, rather than assessing the compatibility of the Rules themselves with article 8, "has led to unpredictability and inconsistency which are anathema to good administration" (para 11). The conclusion drawn was that "it would be better if proportionality were determined according to provisions in the Rules" (para 18). The thinking behind the new rules, therefore, was that "if the Rules are proportionate, a decision taken in accordance with the Rules will, other than in exceptional cases, be compatible with A8" (para 20). As a result, "the role of the courts should shift from reviewing the proportionality of individual administrative decisions to reviewing the proportionality of the Rules" (para 22).</p>

It is said to reflect how, under article 8, the balance will be struck between the right to respect for private and family life and the legitimate aims listed in article 8(2). The Appendix nevertheless contemplates that the Rules will not cover all the circumstances in which a person may have a valid claim to enter or remain in the UK as a result of his or her article 8 rights.

Certain requirements apply in all cases: for example, that the applicant meets suitability requirements relating to such matters as his or her criminal record. Other requirements depend on the applicant's circumstances. In particular, under paragraph R-LTRP.1.1(d), the applicant must not be in the UK on temporary admission or temporary release, or in breach of immigration laws (disregarding an overstay of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1 applies.

There is a statement, in relation to applications for leave to enter or remain as a partner on the basis of family life, that "if the applicant does not meet the requirements of the Rules, the application should be refused" (para 3). That statement is, however, implicitly qualified by later provisions. In relation to the eligibility requirements relating to immigration status, the Instructions state that, for leave to remain, the applicant must not have overstayed by more than 28 days, unless paragraph EX.1 applies (para 3.2.4).

Relevant factors are said to include the ability of the parties to enter and stay lawfully in the country concerned; cultural and religious barriers; and the impact of a mental or physical disability.

Instead, 'exceptional' means circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that refusal of the application would not be proportionate. That is likely to be the case only very rarely." (para 3.2.7d)</span></p>  
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In determining whether there are exceptional circumstances, the decision maker is instructed to consider all relevant factors. Some examples are given:</p>  
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">"The circumstances around the applicant's entry to the UK and the proportion of the time they have been in the UK legally as opposed to illegally. Did they form their relationship with their partner at a time when they had no immigration status or this was precarious? Family life which involves the applicant putting down roots in the UK in the full knowledge that their stay here is unlawful or precarious, should be given less weight, when balanced against the factors weighing in favour of removal, than family life formed by a person lawfully present in the UK."</p>  
<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is also pointed out that cumulative factors should be considered.

Her application conceded that her case fell outside the Rules, and submitted that it was an appropriate case for the grant of discretionary leave, consistently with article 8. It was said that she was settled in the UK and had developed strong social ties there, that her family ties in Ghana had been weakened by her long absence and that most of her friends there had moved abroad. The application disclosed that she had a mother, three children by a former husband, and two siblings living in Ghana. The effect of removal to Ghana upon her family life was addressed in the following terms:</a></p><a name="para21">

The decision considered separately whether Ms Agyarko qualified for leave to remain under the partner route provisions of Appendix FM (ie Section R-LTRP) or under the private life provisions of the Rules (which are not in issue in these appeals), and whether her application gave rise to any exceptional circumstances which might warrant consideration of a grant of leave outside the Rules pursuant to article 8.</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The application under the partner route was therefore refused. Ms Agyarko was also found to fail to qualify for leave to remain on the basis of her private life.

Finally, the decision stated that it had been considered whether the application raised any exceptional circumstances which, consistently with article 8, might warrant consideration of a grant of leave to remain outside the requirements of the Rules. It had been decided that it did not. Although she claimed to be suffering from medical conditions, she had been unable to provide any documentary evidence to show any recent conditions or treatment.

Although the Upper Tribunal judge accepted that there had been a failure to give proper consideration to the question whether Ms Ikuga and Mr Ijiekhuamhen lived together, he considered that her application for leave to remain was bound to fail in any event. Under the Rules, she would have to establish "insurmountable obstacles" within the meaning of paragraph EX.1(b), but the matters put forward on her behalf "could not possibly persuade any decision-maker that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria". In that regard, the judge observed that the fact that Ms Ikuga's partner would have to change jobs was not an insurmountable obstacle; nor was Ms Ikuga's wish to continue fertility treatment in the UK. An application outside the Rules was also bound to fail: the matters put forward did not come close to establishing that it would be "unjustifiably harsh" to require her to return.

Sales LJ considered first an argument based on the phrase "insurmountable obstacles", used in paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM. Sales LJ accepted that the phrase was intended to have the same meaning as in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, where it originated. It imposed a stringent test, illustrated by  <i>Jeunesse v The Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/1036.html">(2015) 60 EHRR 17</a>, para 117, where the court found that there were no insurmountable obstacles to the applicant's family settling in Suriname, although they would experience a degree of hardship if forced to do so. It was to be interpreted, both in the European case law and in the Rules, in a sensible and practical rather than a purely literal way. On the facts of Ms Agyarko's case, the Secretary of State's conclusion that there were no insurmountable obstacles to relocation, and that paragraph EX.1(b) was therefore not met, was not irrational:</p>  
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt; margin-left:72.0pt">"The statement made in Mrs Agyarko's letter of application of 26 September 2012 that 'she may be separated from' her husband was very weak, and was not supported by any evidence which might lead to the conclusion that insurmountable obstacles existed to them pursuing their family life together overseas. There was no witness statement from Mrs Agyarko or <i> </i>Mr Benette to explain what obstacles might exist. The mere facts that Mr Benette is a British citizen, has lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence might find it difficult and might be reluctant to relocate to Ghana to continue their family life there - could not constitute insurmountable obstacles to his doing so." (para 25)</p>  
<p class="ParaNoNumber">On the facts of Ms Ikuga's case, Sales LJ agreed with the Upper Tribunal judge's assessment that "the factors relied upon by Mrs Ikuga could not possibly persuade any decision-maker that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria, within the meaning of [paragraph EX.1(b)]" (para 50).</p>  
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alternative argument in each case was that the refusal to grant leave to remain outside the Rules was in breach of article 8. It was argued that it was disproportionate to remove each of the appellants in circumstances where her husband or partner would have to follow her overseas if they wished to continue their family life together, especially when he was a British citizen; or, alternatively, because an out-of-country application for leave to enter would inevitably be granted, so that her removal served no good purpose. In relation to the latter argument, reliance was placed on the case of  <i>Chikwamba</i>.</a></p><a name="para34">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These arguments were rejected. In the case of Ms Agyarko, Sales LJ stated that, since her family life was established in the knowledge that she had no right to be in the UK and was therefore "precarious" in the sense in which that term had been used in the European and domestic case law, it was only if her case was exceptional for some reason that she would be able to establish a violation of article 8.</a></p><a name="para35">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of Ms Agyarko's case, Sales LJ considered that there were no exceptional circumstances. The fact that Ms Agyarko's spouse was a British citizen did not make the case exceptional: several of the European cases in which applications were rejected had involved a partner or spouse who was a national of the state from which the applicant was to be removed. So far as  <i>Chikwamba </i>was concerned, the House of Lords had found that there would be a violation of article 8 if the applicant for leave to remain in that case were removed from the UK and forced to make an out-of-country application for leave to enter which would clearly be successful, in circumstances where the interference with her family life could not be said to serve any good purpose. In Sales LJ's view, Ms Agyarko's case was very far from a  <i>Chikwamba </i>type of case. She had not asked the Secretary of State to consider whether leave to remain should be granted on the basis of  <i>Chikwamba. </i>This was not an argument of such obviousness that the Secretary of State had been obliged to consider it regardless of whether it was mentioned. Accordingly, the Secretary of State could not be said to have erred in law in failing to grant leave to remain on that basis. In any event, the materials submitted by Ms Agyarko did not demonstrate that an out-of-country application for leave to enter would succeed. On the contrary, the information provided about her and Mr Benette's financial circumstances, for example, indicated that she had no income and that he earned less than the minimum income requirement specified in Appendix FM.</a></p><a name="para36">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sales LJ considered that the Secretary of State's decision letter in the case of Ms Agyarko left something to be desired regarding the clarity of the reasoning, but had addressed the substance of her case under the Rules. There was no arguable case for leave to be granted outside the Rules which required to be addressed separately.</a></p><a name="para37">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to Ms Ikuga's appeal in respect of refusal of leave to remain outside the Rules on the basis of article 8, Sales LJ again considered that the Upper Tribunal judge's assessment could not be faulted. Ms Ikuga's case involved precarious family life, with no children. No compelling medical circumstances had been shown to exist. The claim for leave to remain had not been put to the Secretary of State on the basis of  <i>Chikwamba</i>, <i> </i>and in any event no materials were submitted which might show that leave to enter would have to be granted under Appendix FM if applied for. Although the Secretary of State had not considered the issue on the correct factual basis as regards Ms Ikuga's relationship with her partner, this was very far from being a case in which exceptional circumstances could be found to exist, even on a correct understanding of the facts. Even if Ms Ikuga's application were remitted to be reconsidered by the Secretary of State on the footing that Ms Ikuga and Mr Ijiekhuamhen cohabited and had a genuine subsisting relationship, there was no prospect whatever that the outcome would be a grant of leave to remain.</a></p><a name="para38">

In  <i>Jeunesse v Netherlands</i>, the Grand Chamber analysed the situation of such a person, consistently with earlier judgments of the court, as raising the question whether the authorities of the host country were under a duty, pursuant to article 8, to grant the person the necessary permission to enable her to exercise her right to family life on their territory. The situation was thus analysed not as one in which the host country was interfering with the person's right to respect for her private and family life, raising the question whether the interference was justified under article 8(2). Instead, the situation was analysed as one in which the person was effectively asserting that her right to respect for her private and family life, under article 8(1), imposed on the host country an obligation to permit her to continue to reside there, and the question was whether such an obligation was indeed imposed. In the light of this approach, counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the refusal of leave to remain in the UK to persons unlawfully resident here should similarly be analysed as raising the question whether the state is under a positive obligation to permit the applicant to remain in the UK rather than whether the refusal of the application can be justified under article 8(2).</a></p><a name="para40">

As this court explained in its judgment in  <i>Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/60.html">[2016] UKSC 60</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/60.html">[2016] 1 WLR 4799</a>, para 32, the mode of analysis is unlikely to be of substantial importance in the present context. Ultimately, whether the case is considered to concern a positive or a negative obligation, the question for the European court is whether a fair balance has been struck. As was explained in  <i>Hesham Ali </i>at paras 47-49, that question is determined under our domestic law by applying the structured approach to proportionality which has been followed since  <i>Huang</i>.</p>

Relevant factors were said to include the extent to which family life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the contracting state, whether there were "insurmountable obstacles" in the way of the family living in the country of origin of the non-national concerned, and whether there were factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (para 107).</a></p><a name="para42">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appears that the European court intends the words "insurmountable obstacles" to be understood in a practical and realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the country of origin of the non-national concerned. In some cases, the court has used other expressions which make that clearer: for example, referring to "un obstacle majeur" ( <i>Sen v The Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/888.html">(2003) 36 EHRR 7</a>, para 40), or to "major impediments" ( <i>Tuquabo-Tekle v The Netherlands </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/803.html">[2006] 1 FLR 798</a>, para 48), or to "the test of 'insurmountable obstacles' or 'major impediments'" ( <i>IAA v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2016/986.html">(2016) 62 EHRR SE 19</a>, paras 40 and 44), or asking itself whether the family could "realistically" be expected to move ( <i>Sezen v The Netherlands </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/87.html">(2006) 43 EHRR 30</a>, para 47). "Insurmountable obstacles" is, however, the expression employed by the Grand Chamber; and the court's application of it indicates that it is a stringent test. In  <i>Jeunesse</i>, <i> </i>for example, there were said to be no insurmountable obstacles to the relocation of the family to Suriname, although the children, the eldest of whom was at secondary school, were Dutch nationals who had lived there all their lives, had never visited Suriname, and would experience a degree of hardship if forced to move, and the applicant's partner was in full-time employment in the Netherlands: see paras 117 and 119.</p>  
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Domestically, the expression "insurmountable obstacles" appears in paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM to the Rules. As explained in para 15 above, that paragraph applies in cases where an applicant for leave to remain under the partner route is in the UK in breach of immigration laws, and requires that there should be insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK. The expression "insurmountable obstacles" is now defined by paragraph EX.2 as meaning "very significant difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner." That definition appears to me to be consistent with the meaning which can be derived from the Strasbourg case law. As explained in para 16 above, paragraph EX.2 was not introduced until after the dates of the decisions in the present cases. Prior to the insertion of that definition, it would nevertheless be reasonable to infer, consistently with the Secretary of State's statutory duty to act compatibly with Convention rights, that the expression was intended to bear the same meaning in the Rules as in the Strasbourg case law from which it was derived. I would therefore interpret it as bearing the same meaning as is now set out in paragraph EX.2.</a></p><a name="para44">

Accordingly, interpreting the expression in the same sense as in the Strasbourg case law, leave to remain would not normally be granted in cases where an applicant for leave to remain under the partner route was in the UK in breach of immigration laws, unless the applicant or their partner would face very serious difficulties in continuing their family life together outside the UK, which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship. Even in a case where such difficulties do not exist, however, leave to remain can nevertheless be granted outside the Rules in "exceptional circumstances", in accordance with the Instructions: that is to say, in "circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that refusal of the application would not be proportionate". Is that situation compatible with article 8?</a></p><a name="para45">

As was explained at para 10 above, they are statements of the practice to be followed, which are approved by Parliament, and are based on the Secretary of State's policy as to how individual rights under article 8 should be balanced against the competing public interests. They are designed to operate on the basis that decisions taken in accordance with them are compatible with article 8 in all but exceptional cases. The Secretary of State is in principle entitled to have a policy of the kind which underpins the Rules. While the European court has provided guidance as to factors which should be taken into account, it has acknowledged that the weight to be attached to the competing considerations, in striking a fair balance, falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, subject to supervision at the European level. The margin of appreciation of national authorities is not unlimited, but it is nevertheless real and important. Immigration control is an intensely political issue, on which differing views are held within the contracting states, and as between those states. The ECHR has therefore to be applied in a manner which is capable of accommodating different approaches, within limits. Under the constitutional arrangements existing within the UK, the courts can review the compatibility of decision-making in relation to immigration with the Convention rights, but the authorities responsible for determining policy in relation to immigration, within the limits of the national margin of appreciation, are the Secretary of State and Parliament.</a></p><a name="para46">

The courts can review that general assessment in the event that the decision-making process is challenged as being incompatible with Convention rights or based on an erroneous understanding of the law, but they have to bear in mind the Secretary of State's constitutional responsibility for policy in this area, and the endorsement of the Rules by Parliament. It is also the function of the courts to consider individual cases which come before them on appeal or by way of judicial review, and that will require them to consider how the balance is struck in individual cases. In doing so, they have to take the Secretary of State's policy into account and to attach considerable weight to it at a general level, as well as considering all the factors which are relevant to the particular case. This was explained in  <i>Hesham Ali </i>at paras 44-46, 50 and 53.</a></p><a name="para47">

It is argued that the Secretary of State has treated "insurmountable obstacles" as a test applicable to persons in the UK in breach of immigration laws, whereas the European court treats it as a relevant factor in relation to non-settled migrants. That is true, but it does not mean that the Secretary of State's test is incompatible with article 8. As has been explained, the Rules are not a summary of the European court's case law, but a statement of the Secretary of State's policy. That policy is qualified by the scope allowed for leave to remain to be granted outside the Rules. If the applicant or his or her partner would face very significant difficulties in continuing their family life together outside the UK, which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship, then the "insurmountable obstacles" test will be met, and leave will be granted under the Rules. If that test is not met, but the refusal of the application would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, such that refusal would not be proportionate, then leave will be granted outside the Rules on the basis that there are "exceptional circumstances". In the absence of either "insurmountable obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined, however, it is not apparent why it should be incompatible with article 8 for leave to be refused. The Rules and Instructions are therefore compatible with article 8. That is not, of course, to say that decisions applying the Rules and Instructions in individual cases will necessarily be compatible with article 8: that is a question which, if a decision is challenged, must be determined independently by the court or tribunal in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That instruction is consistent with the case law of the European court, such as its judgment in  <i>Jeunesse. </i>As the instruction makes clear, "precariousness" is not a preliminary hurdle to be overcome.

For example, if an applicant would otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the weight of the public interest in his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if an application were made from outside the UK, then there might be no public interest in his or her removal.

This point was made by Lord Bingham and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in  <i>EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/41.html">[2008] UKHL 41</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/41.html">[2009] AC 1159</a>, paras 15 and 37.

That reflects the weight attached to the contracting states' right to control their borders, as an attribute of their sovereignty, and the limited weight which is generally attached to family life established in the full knowledge that its continuation in the contracting state is unlawful or precarious. The court has repeatedly acknowledged that "a state is entitled, as a matter of well-established international law, and subject to its treaty obligations, to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory and their residence there" ( <i>Jeunesse</i>, <i> </i>para 100). As the court has made clear, the Convention is not intended to undermine that right by enabling non-nationals to evade immigration control by establishing a family life while present in the host state unlawfully or temporarily, and then presenting it with a fait accompli. On the contrary, "where confronted with a fait accompli the removal of the non-national family member by the authorities would be incompatible with article 8 only in exceptional circumstances" ( <i>Jeunesse</i>, <i> </i>para 114).</a></p><a name="para54">

In the  <i>Jeunesse </i>case, for example, the Dutch authorities' tolerance of the applicant's unlawful presence in that country for a very prolonged period, during which she developed strong family and social ties there, led the court to conclude that the circumstances were exceptional and that a fair balance had not been struck (paras 121-122). As the court put it, in view of the particular circumstances of the case, it was questionable whether general immigration considerations could be regarded as sufficient justification for refusing the applicant residence in the host state (para 121).</a></p><a name="para55">

Lord Dyson MR, giving the judgment of the court, said:</p>  
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">"In our view, that is not to say that a test of exceptionality is being applied. Rather it is that, in approaching the question of whether removal is a proportionate interference with an individual's article 8 rights, the scales are heavily weighted in favour of deportation and something very compelling (which will be 'exceptional') is required to outweigh the public interest in removal." (para 42)</p>  
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Cases are not, therefore, to be approached by searching for a unique or unusual feature, and in its absence rejecting the application without further examination. Rather, as the Master of the Rolls made clear, the test is one of proportionality. The reference to exceptional circumstances in the European case law means that, in cases involving precarious family life, "something very compelling ... is required to outweigh the public interest", applying a proportionality test. The Court of Appeal went on to apply that approach to the interpretation of the Rules concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, where the same phrase appears; and their approach was approved by this court, in that context, in  <i>Hesham Ali</i>.</p>  
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That approach is also appropriate when a court or tribunal is considering whether a refusal of leave to remain is compatible with article 8 in the context of precarious family life. Ultimately, it has to decide whether the refusal is proportionate in the particular case before it, balancing the strength of the public interest in the removal of the person in question against the impact on private and family life. In doing so, it should give appropriate weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in the Rules and the Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control can be outweighed, when considering an application for leave to remain brought by a person in the UK in breach of immigration laws, only where there are "insurmountable obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined. It must also consider all factors relevant to the specific case in question, including, where relevant, the matters discussed in paras 51-52 above. The critical issue will generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the public interest in the removal of the person in the case before it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general, in cases concerned with precarious family life, a very strong or compelling claim is required to outweigh the public interest in immigration control.</a></p><a name="para57">

Instead, the Secretary of State operated arrangements under which effect was given to article 8 outside the Rules. Lord Bingham, giving the opinion of the Committee, observed that the ultimate question for the appellate immigration authority was whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the life of the family could not reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account of all considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudiced the family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of article 8. If the answer to that question was affirmative, then the refusal was unlawful. He added:</a></p><a name="para59">  
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para59">"It is not necessary that the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along the lines indicated in this opinion, need ask in addition whether the case meets a test of exceptionality.

The Rules and Instructions in issue in the present case do not depart from that position. The Secretary of State has not imposed a test of exceptionality, in the sense which Lord Bingham had in mind: that is to say, a requirement that the case should exhibit some highly unusual feature, over and above the application of the test of proportionality. On the contrary, she has defined the word "exceptional", as already explained, as meaning "circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that the refusal of the application would not be proportionate". So understood, the provision in the Instructions that leave can be granted outside the Rules where exceptional circumstances apply involves the application of the test of proportionality to the circumstances of the individual case, and cannot be regarded as incompatible with article 8. That conclusion is fortified by the express statement in the Instructions that "exceptional" does not mean "unusual" or "unique": see para 19 above.</a></p><a name="para60">

On the other hand, the Treaty provisions on citizenship of the Union do not confer any autonomous right on third-country nationals. Any rights conferred on third-country nationals are derived from those enjoyed by the Union citizen.

The principle established in that case has been applied and developed in other cases concerned with third-country parents of minor dependent children, such as  <i>Alokpa and Moudoulou v Ministre du Travail, de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration </i>(Case C-86/12), judgment of 10 October 2013, and  <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v CS</i>.</a></p><a name="para64">

The case of  <i>Dereci v Bundesministerium für Inneres </i>(Case C-256/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C25611.html">[2011] ECR I-11315</a>, concerned the refusal of a residence permit to a third-country national who had entered Austria unlawfully, married an Austrian citizen, and had three minor children who were Austrian citizens. His challenge to the refusal of the residence permit on the basis of  <i>Ruiz Zambrano </i>was rejected by the Grand Chamber. It derived from  <i>Ruiz Zambrano </i>that "the criterion relating to the denial of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of EU citizen status refers to situations in which the Union citizen has, in fact, to leave not only the territory of the member state of which he is a national but also the territory of the Union as a whole" (para 66). That criterion was not satisfied on the facts of  <i>Dereci</i>, since the refusal of the residence permit to the third-country national would not necessitate the rest of the family leaving the EU: the children and their mother could remain in Austria without him. The Grand Chamber stated:</p>  
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">"Consequently, the mere fact that it might appear desirable to a national of a member state, for economic reasons or in order to keep his family together in the territory of the Union, for the members of his family who do not have the nationality of a member state to be able to reside with him in the territory of the Union, is not sufficient in itself to support the view that the Union citizen will be forced to leave Union territory if such a right is not granted."

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering first whether the decision in the case of Ms Agyarko was compatible with article 8, the court has to bear in mind that this was a case of precarious family life, and that therefore, having regard to the Strasbourg case law, a very strong or compelling claim was required to outweigh the public interest in immigration control. The court has also to give due weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in the Rules and the Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control can be outweighed, when considering an application for leave to remain under the partner route brought by a person in the UK in breach of immigration laws, only where there are "insurmountable obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined. There was no evidence placed before the Secretary of State on which a conclusion that there were insurmountable obstacles to relocation in Ghana could reasonably have been reached. There was nothing to suggest that there were "exceptional circumstances" as defined in the Instructions, that is to say, circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that the refusal of the application would not be proportionate. Considering all relevant factors, Ms Agyarko's claim could not be regarded as very strong or compelling. Nor was there anything to indicate that Ms Agyarko might come within the scope of  <i>Chikwamba</i>.</a></p><a name="para70">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel pointed out that some parts of Ms Agyarko's notice of decision were in similar terms to Ms Ikuga's, with only factual details differing from one to the other. The use of standard forms of words was criticised as formulaic, and as being inconsistent with "anxious scrutiny". It was also pointed out that the decision in relation to the issue of "exceptional circumstances" contained no reference to any specific aspects of Ms Agyarko's application. It is true that the decision was briefly expressed and, in relation to the issue of exceptional circumstances, did not discuss the matters raised in the application. The notice of decision nevertheless addressed the relevant issues in Ms Agyarko's case, demonstrated that the most important points put forward on her behalf (her length of residence in the UK, her weakened family ties to Ghana, her relationship with her husband, his British citizenship, his full-time employment in the UK, and the difficulties which he might encounter in relocating to Ghana) had been considered, and explained why, notwithstanding those points, her application was refused. The use of standardised reasons is characteristic of modern decision-making practices in fields of public administration where large numbers of applications can be processed more efficiently by employing information technology, using decision templates, drop-down menus and other software. It is also often designed to facilitate internal auditing and management processes. The potential implications of this development for the law relating to the giving of reasons have not been considered in these appeals; nor has the manner in which the decision notices in question were produced. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that the use of standard phrases is not in itself legally objectionable, provided the reasons given continue to explain adequately why the decision has been taken.</a></p><a name="para71">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms Ikuga's application under the partner route was refused on the ground that she had provided no evidence to show that she had been living at the same address as Mr Ijiekhuamhen. It is accepted that that decision was erroneous: Ms Ikuga had in fact provided evidence that she and Mr Ijiekhuamhen lived at the same address. It follows that the Secretary of State has not yet considered Ms Ikuga's case on a correct understanding of all the material facts. In those circumstances, it would usually follow that the Secretary of State's decision should be quashed, and the application re-considered. The court's jurisdiction to quash being discretionary, however, it is open to it to decline to quash if satisfied that the decision, if re-taken, would inevitably be the same. It was on that basis that the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal declined to grant permission to apply for judicial review.</a></p><a name="para72">  
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to this matter, this court has no basis for interfering with the decision of the specialist judge of the Upper Tribunal, affirmed by the Court of Appeal. So far as the application under the Rules was concerned, the judge correctly identified that Ms Ikuga would have to satisfy the "insurmountable obstacles" test in paragraph EX.1(b), and explained convincingly why she could not do so on the basis of the information which she had placed before the Secretary of State: see the summary of his reasoning at para 32 above, and the summary of the material which Ms Ikuga had provided, at paras 26-28 and 30 above. Nothing in the discussion of that test in this judgment places in question his conclusion, with which the Court of Appeal agreed, that the test could not possibly be met on the basis put forward on Ms Ikuga's behalf: in summary, that her partner was in full-time employment in the UK, and she was undergoing fertility treatment. So far as leave to remain was sought outside the Rules, there is similarly nothing in this judgment which undermines his conclusion, with which the Court of Appeal agreed, that Ms Ikuga had not put forward anything which might constitute "exceptional circumstances" as defined in the Instructions, that is to say, unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that the refusal of the application would not be proportionate.</a></p><a name="para73">
