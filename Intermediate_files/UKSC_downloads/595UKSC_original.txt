<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is concerned with the extent and consequences of duties of
“equal treatment” or “fairness”, said to have been owed by the Office of Fair
Trading (“OFT”) to those subject to investigation under the Competition Act
1998 (“the Act”). Since the events in question the OFT has been replaced by the
Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), but it will be convenient in this
judgment to refer throughout to the OFT.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The facts</b></p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The investigation</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In March 2003 the OFT began an investigation into alleged price-fixing
arrangements in the tobacco market, contrary to section 2(1) of the Act. On 24
April 2008, it issued a Statement of Objections (“SO”) under section 31 of the
Act, addressed to 13 parties, including two manufacturers and 11 retailers. The
first respondents (“Gallaher”) were involved as manufacturers; the second
respondents (“Somerfield”) as retailers. On 15 April 2010 the OFT issued its
decision (“the Tobacco decision”) upholding the finding of infringement against
both respondents, and all but one of the other parties. Six of those affected
appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The respondents did not appeal,
having each reached settlements with the OFT under the so-called “Early resolution
process” (or “ER process”).</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading">The ER process</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The letters accompanying the SOs sent to the parties in April 2008 had
offered the possibility of obtaining a reduction in the financial penalty
through co-operation with the OFT’s investigation. The parties were invited to
indicate by 9 May 2008 whether they wished to enter into without prejudice
discussion with the OFT for this purpose. Both the respondents responded
positively within the time-limit. Following negotiations they, along with four
other parties, entered into Early Resolution Agreements (“ERAs”).</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The ERAs required the signatories’ admission of involvement in the
infringements, set out a series of terms for further co-operation, and
indicated the penalties to be imposed subject to a possible reduction of up to
20% for procedural co-operation. Entry into an ERA did not prevent a party from
terminating that agreement at any time up to publication of the OFT’s final
decision. If a party did terminate an ERA, it would forgo any discounted
penalty negotiated as part of the ERA. In that event, the OFT would continue
with its case against that party in accordance with the usual administrative
procedure. A party to an ERA could also, upon receiving the final decision,
decide to appeal against it if it wished to do so, notwithstanding the
admissions in the ERA. In that event, the OFT reserved the right to make an
application to the Tribunal to increase the penalty and to require the party to
the ERA to pay the OFT’s full costs of the appeal regardless of the outcome.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The ER process was not subject to any statutory rules, nor at the
material time described in any published document. The clearest contemporary
description of the ER process (though not by that name) came in an internal
document of the OFT dated 28 January 2008, and entitled “A principled approach
to Settlements in Competition Act cases”. This paper was designed to draw out
“a number of principles from the OFT’s experience to date, and emerging
thinking, on settlements in Competition Act 1998 cases”, and to provide “a
policy framework for teams who may be considering the possibility of settlement”.
Ten principles were identified and discussed.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Particular attention in the present case has been directed to Principle
Three: “Fairness, transparency and consistency are integral to an effective
settlements process”. This was explained as follows:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overriding principles
of fairness, transparency and consistency must always be taken into account.
When engaged in settlement discussions, for example, it is important to ensure
that the process is consensual and as transparent as possible throughout, in
order to avoid any subsequent allegations of undue pressure having been applied
to force parties to ‘sign up’ to settlement.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistency is a particularly
key consideration, given parties’ sensitivity to equality of treatment issues.
Whether or not the details of an individual case have been made public,
particular approaches in one case will inevitably ‘leak out’ during the
settlement process (and be set out in the infringement decision) and inform
parties’ strategies in others. Consistency of approach (or, alternatively, the
formulation of strong arguments to justify taking a different approach in
similar circumstances) is therefore vital …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although this is useful as indicating the adopted policy approach of the
OFT itself, it is not suggested that the contents were known to or in terms
relied on by the respondents when entering into their agreements. However, the
OFT had a separate “speaking note” for use in discussions with parties. This
summarised the main features of the ER process, and ended with the following
commitment to “equal treatment”:</a></p><a name="para7">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Once first party signed up, the
OFT will inform other parties of the terms agreed in terms of the Step 1 to 5
penalty calculation - these terms will be the benchmark for dealing with other
parties (as the OFT will observe equal treatment principles).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both the respondents concluded ERAs with the OFT in early July 2008,
involving substantial reductions in the anticipated penalties. In due course,
when the OFT decision was issued in April 2010 the respondents did not appeal,
but instead elected to pay the penalties imposed in the ERAs, taking the
benefit of the reductions.</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="ParaHeading">TMR</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Martin McColl Retail Group Ltd and TM Retail Group Ltd (together, “TMR”)
was another party subject to the investigation, which also entered into an ERA.
In the course of the negotiations for the ERA, at a meeting on 8 July 2008,
TMR’s representatives asked about the OFT’s likely attitude to those who
entered ERAs in the event of a successful appeal by one of the other parties to
the investigation. The effect of the exchange was recorded in an email from TMR
to OFT after the meeting in the following terms (which were not contradicted):</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Should another manufacturer or
retailer appeal any OFT decision against that manufacturer or retailer to the
CAT (or subsequently appeal to a higher court) and overturn, on appeal, part or
all of the OFT’s decision against that manufacturer or retailer in relation to
either liability or fines, then, <i>to the extent the principles determined in
the appeal decision are contrary to or otherwise undermine the OFT's decision
against [TMR], the OFT will apply the same principles to [TMR]</i> (and
therefore presumably withdraw or vary its decision against [TMR] as required).”
(Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In the course of 2009 and 2010, and before the expiry of
the time for appealing the OFT decision, two other parties (“Party A” and Asda)
made similar inquiries about the effect of a successful appeal by other
parties, but received non-committal answers.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Tribunal’s decision and its aftermath</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 12 December 2011 the Tribunal gave judgment allowing all six appeals:
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/CAT/2011/41.html">[2011] CAT 41</a>. Following the Tribunal’s judgment, TMR wrote to the OFT inviting
it to withdraw the OFT’s decision as against it, and threatening legal action
if it failed to do so. In the course of further discussions TMR relied on the OFT’s
earlier assurances about its position in the event of a successful appeal by
another party, stating that this had been “a key factor” in its own
decision-making. As to what followed I take the following from the agreed
statement of facts (para 50):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The OFT considered that the
statements which it had made to TMR in 2008 might have given rise to an
understanding on the part of TMR that the OFT would withdraw or vary its
decision against TMR in the event of a successful third party appeal. In light
of this, the OFT considered that there was a real risk that TMR would, as a
result of this reliance on those statements, be permitted to appeal out of time
to the Tribunal and would succeed in that appeal. The OFT reached a settlement
agreement with TMR, by which the OFT agreed to pay to TMR an amount equal to
the penalty TMR had paid together with a contribution to interest and legal
costs. The Tobacco Decision was not withdrawn against TMR. The agreed terms
were set out in a settlement agreement dated 9 August 2012.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The OFT then published a statement about the TMR settlement
on its website, in which it said that “in the light of the particular
assurances provided to TM Retail” it had agreed to pay the amount of its
penalty (£2,668,991) and a contribution to costs.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, following the Tribunal’s decision, in February 2012
each of the respondents had written to the OFT calling upon it to withdraw the
decision as against them, and to refund the penalties. This was refused. In
August 2012, after the publication of the information about the settlement
between the OFT and TMR, they sent the OFT letters before claim, arguing that
they also should be given the benefit of the assurances made to TMR. In October
2012 they issued the present claims for judicial review.</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="ParaHeading">The out-of-time appeals</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claims were initially stayed by consent to allow the respondents to
pursue applications, made in July 2012, for permission to appeal the Tobacco
Decision out of time. By rule 8(2) of the Competition Appeal Tribunal Rules
2003 (SI 1372/2003), the Tribunal may not extend the time limit for appeal unless
satisfied that “the circumstances are exceptional”. The applications succeeded
before the Tribunal, but its decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal on 7
April 2014: <i>Office of Fair Trading v Somerfield Stores Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/400.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 400</a>. The court held that there were no exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the leading judgment Vos LJ referred (paras 35-36) to the principle
of finality, exemplified by the CJEU’s decision in <i>Commission of the
European Communities v AssiDoman Kraft Products AB</i> (Case C-310/97P) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1999/C31097P.html">[1999] All ER (EC) 737</a> (the “<i>Wood Pulp II</i>” case). That principle was said to be
based on the consideration that the purpose of such time-limits is “to ensure
legal certainty by preventing Community measures which produce legal effects
from being called in question indefinitely”. Although the <i>Wood Pulp II</i>
decision was “no more than analogous”, it pointed the way to “the need for
finality in competition cases”. In the present case, in Vos LJ’s view, the
respondents had entered the ERAs with their eyes open and made a deliberate
decision not to appeal. He added:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is true that the OFT has the
role of a prosecutor and has wide powers to impose penalties, and that those
powers must be exercised on a proper basis, but that does not stop commercial
parties from taking a commercial view as to whether or not to sign up to an ERA
after a long investigatory process and the publication of a lengthy Statement
of Objections. The addressee knows precisely the terms that are being offered.
It knows what it has done in relation to the alleged infringements, and what it
is being asked to admit, and the terms requiring its co-operation and the
fetters on its rights of defence to which it is being asked to agree. It can
take it or leave it …” (para 45)</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The courts below</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In a judgment dated 26 January 2015, Collins J rejected the claims:
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/84.html">[2015] EWHC 84 (Admin)</a>. He started from the proposition that the OFT’s powers
in relation to infringement of the 1998 Act were “subject to public law
requirements of fairness and equal treatment”, so that it was “essential that
in negotiations in relation to ERAs one party is not given an advantage denied
to another” (para 38). However, the assurance given to TMR had been given in
error, without regard to the finality principle. Citing <i>Customs and Excise
Comrs v National Westminster Bank plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2003/1822.html">[2003] STC 1072</a> para 66, he agreed
with Jacob J that “as a general rule a mistake should not be replicated where
public funds are concerned”. That consideration provided “an objective
justification” for the refusal by the OFT to make payment to the claimants
(para 50).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal took a different view </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/719.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 719</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/719.html">[2016] Bus LR 1200</a>. In the leading judgment, Lord Dyson MR (para 34) noted it as
common ground that (in the words of Cranston J, <i>Crest Nicholson plc v Office
of Fair Trading</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/1875.html">[2009] EWHC 1875 (Admin)</a>) “the OFT must comply with the
principle of equal treatment in all steps leading up to the imposition of a
penalty”. He agreed that the assurance given to TMR was a mistake: “a decision
which no-one who had the finality and legal certainty principles in mind could
reasonably have taken” (para 58). The failure to offer a similar assurance to
the claimants or others in the same position, or even to inform them, involved
unequal treatment which was “stark and manifest” (para 59). Under the heading
“Objective justification” (paras 53-54), he agreed with counsel for the OFT
that a mistake was not “a trump card which will always carry the day …” The
question as he saw it was -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… whether there has been
unfairness on the part of the authority having regard to all the circumstances.
The fact that there has been a mistake may be an important circumstance. It may
be decisive. It all depends.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He found assistance in the law relating to legitimate expectation,
citing <i>R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, Ex p Begbie</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/2100.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1115</a>, 1127B-D, per Peter Gibson LJ, to the effect that whether an
authority should be permitted to resile from a mistaken statement “depends on
whether that would give rise to unfairness amounting to an abuse of power”. In
the same way, as he saw it, the question in the present case was “whether the
OFT should be permitted to resile from a mistake where to do so results in
unfair and unequal treatment of the claimants”. He concluded that it should
not.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary to quote the concluding paragraph in full, to indicate
the sequence of events and combination of circumstances, which appear to have
led Lord Dyson MR ultimately to the view that the OFT’s action was unlawful:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the real focus must
be on the question whether the 2012 Decision was objectively justified. That is
when the OFT decided that it would act on the 2008 decision in relation to TMR
and honour the assurances that it had mistakenly given at that time, and to
treat the claimants differently. The result was that it agreed with TMR to
repay the whole of its penalty plus a contribution of £250,000 in relation to
costs and interest. But it refused to pay anything to the claimants. The only
difference between the positions of TMR on the one hand and that of the
claimants on the other hand was that the OFT had given the assurances to TMR in
2008, but not to the claimants. The effect of that manifestly unfair and
unequal treatment in 2008 could have been reversed after the issue had been
raised by Asda and party A and the OFT’s eyes had been opened to the
significance of its earlier mistake in giving the assurances to TMR. That would
have put all the companies which had been the subject of the Tobacco Decision
and to which the [Statement of Objections] has been addressed on an equal
footing. The OFT could have withdrawn the assurances. It would not have been
too late for TMR to appeal at that time. Even if TMR had been out of time, it
would have had a very powerful case for arguing that the withdrawal of the
assurances was an exceptional circumstance which justified an extension of time
for appealing. Instead, the OFT acted on the assurances it had given to TMR,
made the 2012 decision and repaid the penalty previously levied and made
further payments too. In all the circumstances, this was a plain breach of the
principle of equal treatment and unfair.”</p>

</span>It was central to the reasoning of both courts below that the OFT was
subject (as Collins J put it) to “public law requirements of fairness and equal
treatment”. That analysis was not seriously challenged by counsel for the
appellant in this court. They accepted that “the principle of equal treatment”
applied to the OFT, but submitted that it did not require it to replicate a
mistake, at least in the absence of “conspicuous unfairness”. They rely on the
approach of Lord Bingham in <i>R (O’Brien) v Independent Assessor</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/10.html">[2007] 2 AC 312</a>, para 30:</p>

decision-makers, whether administrative or judicial, should act in a broadly
consistent manner. If they do, reasonable hopes will not be disappointed. But
the assessor’s task in this case was to assess fair compensation for each of
the appellants. He was not entitled to award more or less than, in his
considered judgment, they deserved. He was not bound, and in my opinion was not
entitled, to follow a previous decision which he considered erroneous and which
would yield what he judged to be an excessive award.”</p>

</span>The respondents similarly adopt the language of equal treatment and
fairness. Thus Miss Jessica Boyd, counsel for the second respondent, formulated
the issue in these terms:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The issue before the Court is
whether it was conspicuously unfair and/or a breach of the principle of equal
treatment, amounting to a breach of public law, for the OFT, on the successful
appeal of its decision in the Tobacco Decision, to repay one non-appellant
addressee of that decision (namely, TM Retail) the penalty it had paid pursuant
to that decision, while refusing to do the same for the respondents.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para20">The “equal treatment principle” was said to be
well-established in domestic law, by reference for example to <i>R (Middlebrook

from the judgment of Simon Brown LJ in <i>R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p

12 paras 28 and 30 per Lord Dyson. He relied also on the formulation of the
“principle of equal treatment” in European Union law:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principle of equal treatment,
as a general principle of EU law, requires that comparable situations must not
be treated differently and that different situations must not be treated in the
same way, unless such treatment is objectively justified.” (<i>Case C-510/11,
Kone OYJ and others v European Commission (Elevators and Escalators Cartel
Appeal)</i> [2014] 4 CMLR 10, para 97).</p>

</span>This was said to apply to the relevant functions of the OFT, by virtue
of section 60(1) of the Competition Act 1998, the purpose of which is to ensure
that as far as possible “questions arising under this Part in relation to
competition within the United Kingdom” were dealt with in a manner “consistent
with the treatment of corresponding questions arising in Community law …”
However, I say at once that I find no assistance in this respect in section 60,
which seems to me directed to questions arising specifically under the statute,
rather than as here under general principles of administrative law.</a></p><a name="para22">

</span>Whatever the position in European law or under other constitutions or
jurisdictions, the domestic law of this country does not recognise equal
treatment as a distinct principle of administrative law. Consistency, as Lord
Bingham said in the passage relied on by the appellant (para 19 above), is a
“generally desirable” objective, but not an absolute rule.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>The need for clear dividing lines in this context has been highlighted
in the Privy Council’s consideration of various forms of equal treatment clauses
in common law constitutions. Thus for example in <i>Webster v Attorney General
of Trinidad and Tobago</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKPC/2015/10.html">[2015] UKPC 10</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2015/10.html">[2015] ICR 1048</a> the Board was
concerned with section 4(d) of the Constitution of that country, which
recognises “the right of the individual to equality of treatment from any public
authority in the exercise of any functions”. Lady Hale commented (para 14) that
“open-ended constitutional guarantees of equal treatment by public authorities,
such as that in section 4(d), are few and far between”. She contrasted such
provisions with the Constitution of Mauritius, section 16 of which “prohibits
discrimination both by the laws and by public authorities, but only on defined
grounds”, and under which, as the Board had held in <i>Matadeen v Pointu</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1998/9.html">[1999] 1 AC 98</a> “there was no general constitutional right to equal treatment by
the law or by the executive”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the latter case, in an important passage under the heading “Democracy
and Equality” (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1998/9.html">[1999] AC 98</a>, para 9), Lord Hoffmann had emphasised the need to
distinguish between equal treatment as a democratic principle and as a
justiciable rule of law:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … Their Lordships do not
doubt that such a principle is one of the building blocks of democracy and
necessarily permeates any democratic constitution. Indeed, their Lordships
would go further and say that treating like cases alike and unlike cases
differently is a general axiom of rational behaviour. It is, for example,
frequently invoked by the courts in proceedings for judicial review as a ground
for holding some administrative act to have been irrational: see Professor
Jeffrey Jowell QC, Is Equality a Constitutional Principle? (1994) 7 CLP 1,
12-14 and <i>de Smith, Woolf and Jowell,</i> <i>Judicial Review of
Administrative Action</i>, 5th ed (1995), pp 576-582, paras 13-036 to 13-045.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… Of course persons should be
uniformly treated, unless there is some valid reason to treat them differently.
But what counts as a valid reason for treating them differently? And, perhaps
more important, who is to decide whether the reason is valid or not? Must it
always be the courts? The reasons for not treating people uniformly often
involve, as they do in this case, questions of social policy on which views may
differ. These are questions which the elected representatives of the people
have some claim to decide for themselves. The fact that equality of treatment
is a general principle of rational behaviour does not entail that it should
necessarily be a justiciable principle - that it should always be the judges
who have the last word on whether the principle has been observed. In this, as
in other areas of constitutional law, sonorous judicial statements of
uncontroversial principle often conceal the real problem, which is to mark out
the boundary between the powers of the judiciary, the legislature and the
executive in deciding how that principle is to be applied.” (see now the
current edition of <i>De Smith’s Judicial Review</i> 8th ed (2018) paras 11.061ff)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">As that passage makes clear, in domestic administrative law
issues of consistency may arise, but generally as aspects of rationality, under
Lord Diplock’s familiar tripartite categorisation.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The authorities cited by the respondents provide illustrations. The
passage cited by Lord Pannick from Lord Sumption’s judgment in <i>Bank Mellat (No
2) </i>(above) at para 25 was concerned directly with the question of
proportionality under the European Convention on Human Rights, but it was
expressed in terms which could be applied equally to common law rationality.
Lord Sumption spoke of a measure which, while responding to a real problem, may
nevertheless be “irrational or disproportionate by reason of its being
discriminatory in some respect that is incapable of objective justification”.
He gave as the “classic” illustration <i>A v Secretary of State for the Home
Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/56.html">[2005] 2 AC 68</a>, in which it was held by the House of Lords that
a derogation from the Human Rights Convention permitting the detention of
non-nationals considered a risk to national security, was neither a
proportionate nor a rational response to the terrorist threat, because it
applied only to foreign nationals; it was not explained why, if the threat from
UK nationals could be adequately addressed without depriving them of their
liberty, the same should not be true of foreign nationals. He quoted Lord Hope
(para 132): “the distinction … raises an issue of discrimination. ... But, as
the distinction is irrational, it goes to the heart of the issue about
proportionality also.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At a more mundane level, <i>R (Middlebrook Mushrooms Ltd) v Agricultural
Wages Board of England and Wales</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/1447.html">[2004] EWHC 1447 (Admin)</a> (cited by Miss
Boyd) concerned a statutory order under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948, which
established a new category of worker, the Manual Harvest Worker (MHW), whose
minimum wage was lower than that of a Standard Worker, but the order uniquely
excluded mushrooms from the definition of produce the harvesters of which might
be paid at the lower rate. This was challenged successfully by the mushroom
growers. Having rejected as baseless the various reasons put forward for the
distinction, the judge (Stanley Burnton J) concluded that there was no lawful
justification for the exclusion of mushroom pickers from the lower rate. He
cited inter alia Lord Donaldson’s reference to the “cardinal principle of
public administration that all persons in a similar position should be treated
similarly” (para 74) (<i>R (Cheung) v Hertfordshire County Council</i>, The
Times, 4 April 1986). He concluded that the exclusion of manual harvesters of
mushrooms from the MHW category was “<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonable and
unlawful”, or in other words irrational.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present context, however, it is not necessary in my view to look
for some general public law principle of equal treatment. It is not difficult
to hold that the OFT owed a general duty during the negotiations in 2008 to
offer equal treatment to those subject to the Tobacco investigation. There was
no logical reason to do otherwise, since it was applying a single set of legal
and policy criteria to a limited group of parties within a single area of
business activity. In addition, its commitment to equal treatment had been expressed
in terms to those parties (assuming, as I do, that the speaking note fairly
reflects what they were told). To that extent, it may be said, they had in
public law terms a legitimate expectation that they would be treated equally.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, that in itself does not provide an answer to the present
problem. It tells one nothing about the legal consequences of such an
expectation, in terms of rights and remedies in public law, in the events as
they developed up to 2012. Before returning to that critical question, it is
necessary to consider what if anything is added by the concept of “fairness”,
as invoked by Lord Dyson in his concluding paragraph, albeit without direct
reference to authority. It is that gap which the respondents’ counsel have
sought to fill by the authorities noted above, in particular the <i>Unilever </i>case.</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="ParaHeading">Fairness</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fairness, like equal treatment, can readily be seen as a fundamental
principle of democratic society; but not necessarily one directly translatable
into a justiciable rule of law. Addition of the word “conspicuous” does not
obviously improve the precision of the concept. Legal rights and remedies are
not usually defined by reference to the visibility of the misconduct.</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>Simple unfairness as such is not a ground for judicial review. This was
made clear by Lord Diplock in <i>R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p National
Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/TC_55_133.html">[1982] AC 617</a>, 637:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“judicial review is available only
as a remedy for conduct of a public officer or authority which is ultra vires
or unlawful, but not for acts done lawfully in the exercise of an
administrative discretion which are complained of <i>only as being unfair</i>
or unwise, …” (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Procedural fairness or propriety is of course well-established within
Lord Diplock’s trilogy. <i>R v National Lottery Commission, Ex p Camelot Group
plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2000/391.html">[2001] EMLR 3</a>, relied on by the respondents, is a good example. It
concerned unequal treatment between two rival bidders for the lottery, one of
whom was given an unfair procedural advantage over the other. That was rightly
seen by Richards J as amounting to a breach of procedural fairness (see paras
69-70). Although he used the judgment to discuss principles of fairness in a
wider context, that was not essential to his decision, which ultimately turned
on the proposition that the Commission had “decided <i>on a procedure</i> that
results in conspicuous unfairness to Camelot - such unfairness as to render the
decision unlawful” (para 84, emphasis added).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A broader concept of “unfairness amounting to excess or abuse of power”
emerged in a series of cases in the 1980s, under the influence principally of
Lord Scarman. In the <i>National Federation </i>case (above at p 652) he had
been alone in holding that “a legal duty of fairness (was) owed by the revenue
to the general body of taxpayers”. However, in <i>R v Inland Revenue
Commission, Ex p Preston</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1984/5.html">[1985] AC 835</a>, in which he presided, he was able
with the support of Lord Templeman (who gave the leading speech) to develop the
same idea in terms of a duty of fairness to an individual taxpayer, arising
from a written assurance given by the Revenue as to his tax treatment.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Scarman himself said no more than that “unfairness in the purported
exercise of a power can be such that it is an abuse or excess of power”, but he
referred to Lord Templeman’s speech for illustrations (p 851H-852C). Lord
Templeman dealt with this subject in an extended passage, starting from a
citation of various statements in the <i>National Federation </i>case. In
particular he took the words of Lord Scarman about the Revenue’s general duty
of fairness (without noting that it had been a minority view) as supporting a
duty of fairness owed to each individual taxpayer; but subject to the caveat
that the court could not “in the absence of exceptional circumstances” decide
to be unfair that which the commissioners had determined to be fair. Judicial
review, he said, is only available if the court is satisfied that -</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“‘the unfairness’ of which the
applicant complains renders the insistence by the commissioners on performing
their duties or exercise of powers an abuse of power by the commissioners.” (p 864G)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There followed a passage citing various authorities, in which judicial
review was said to have been granted on the grounds of “‘unfairness’ amounting
to abuse of power”, either due to “some proven element of improper motive” (p
864H, citing <i>Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/1.html">[1968] AC 997</a>), or due to “an error of law whereby the Price Commission misconstrued
the code they were intending to enforce” (p 866F, citing <i>HTV Ltd v Price
Commission </i>[1976] ICR 170). These authorities, he thought, supported the
suggestion that the commissioners would be guilty of “‘unfairness’ amounting to
an abuse of power” if their conduct would in a private context entitle the
appellant to “an injunction or damages based on breach of contract or estoppel
by representation” (p 866H-867C).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This part of Lord Templeman’s speech was obiter, since the claim of
abuse of power failed on the facts. It is not without difficulty. It seems that
in all the examples given by Lord Templeman there was a conventional ground of
review, such as improper motive or illegality. It is not clear what he saw the
word “unfairness” (always in inverted commas) as adding to the legal reasoning.
With hindsight the case is best understood by reference to principles of
legitimate expectation derived from an express or implied promise (see <i>de
Smith op cit </i>para 12-019; <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex
p Coughlan </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1871.html">[2001] QB 213</a>, paras 61ff)). It had not been argued on that
basis, perhaps because of the uncertain application at that time of legitimate
expectation to substantive rather than procedural benefits (see <i>United
Policyholders Group v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2016/17.html">[2016] 1 WLR 3383</a> at paras 83ff). The authority is not relied on directly in the present
appeal, but is of some relevance as providing the background to the references
to “unfairness” or “conspicuous unfairness” in the judgments in the <i>Unilever
</i>case, on which the respondents rely, and to which I now turn.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Unilever </i>the Court of Appeal held that the Revenue should not
be permitted without warning to apply a strict time-limit for submission of
claims to loss relief, when to do so departed from a practice accepted by them
without objection for some 20 years. The judge (Macpherson of Cluny J) had held
that the Revenue’s conduct amounted to “a representation in <i>Preston </i>terms”,
or, if not, had led to “unfairness” and “an abuse of power” (p 689f). In the
Court of Appeal the main issue seems to have been whether the taxpayer could
succeed in the absence of a representation by the Revenue which was “clear,
unambiguous, and devoid of relevant qualification”, as stated in previous Court
of Appeal authority (p 690a). Sir Thomas Bingham MR held that, on “the unique
facts” of the case, to reject the claims was “so unfair as to amount to an
abuse of power” (p 691h), and “so unreasonable as to be, in public law terms,
irrational” (p 692f).</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In a concurring judgment, Simon Brown LJ, under the heading “Legitimate
expectation or nothing?” (pp 693-695), sought to relate the case more directly
to Lord Diplock’s famous definition of irrationality as a decision “so
outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no
sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could
have arrived at it” (<i>Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the
Civil Service</i> [1985] 1 AC 374, 410). It was in that context that he
introduced the idea of “conspicuous unfairness”: He said:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“‘Unfairness amounting to an abuse
of power’ as envisaged in <i>Preston</i> and the other Revenue cases is
unlawful not because it involves conduct such as would offend some equivalent
private law principle, not principally indeed because it breaches a legitimate
expectation that some different substantive decision will be taken, but rather
because either it is illogical or immoral or both for a public authority to act
with conspicuous unfairness and in that sense abuse its power.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">“In short”, he regarded the “<i>MFK </i>category of
legitimate expectation” as “essentially but a head of <i>Wednesbury </i>unreasonableness”
(p 695a-b). On the facts of the case, he held that the test was satisfied,
observing that he could think of “no surer guide than Macpherson of Cluny J” in
determining -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the border between on the one
hand mere unfairness -conduct which may be characterised as ‘a bit rich’ but
nevertheless understandable - and on the other hand a decision so outrageously
unfair that it should not be allowed to stand.” (p 697C)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have quoted at some length from these judgments to show how misleading
it can be to take out of context a single expression, such as “conspicuous
unfairness”, and attempt to elevate it into a free-standing principle of law.
The decision in <i>Unilever </i>was unremarkable on its unusual facts, but the
reasoning reflects the case law as it then stood. Surprisingly, it does not
seem to have been strongly argued (as it surely would be today) that a
sufficient representation could be implied from the Revenue’s consistent
practice over 20 years (see eg <i>de Smith </i>para 12-021). It seems clear in
any event from the context that Simon Brown LJ was not proposing “conspicuous
unfairness” as a definitive test of illegality, any more than his contrast with
conduct characterised as “a bit rich”. They were simply expressions used to
emphasise the extreme nature of the Revenue’s conduct, as related to Lord
Diplock’s test. In modern terms, and with respect to Lord Diplock,
“irrationality” as a ground of review can surely hold its own without the
underpinning of such elusive and subjective concepts as judicial “outrage”
(whether by reference to logical or moral standards).</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>In summary, procedural unfairness is well-established and
well-understood. Substantive unfairness on the other hand - or, in Lord Dyson’s
words at para 53, “whether there has been unfairness on the part of the
authority having regard to all the circumstances” - is not a distinct legal
criterion. Nor is it made so by the addition of terms such as “conspicuous” or
“abuse of power”. Such language adds nothing to the ordinary principles of
judicial review, notably in the present context irrationality and legitimate
expectation. It is by reference to those principles that cases such as the
present must be judged.</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The present case</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against that background I can turn to the analysis of the present case.
The respondents no doubt have grounds to complain of the administrative failure
to inform them of the assurance given to TMR in 2008. Had they known of it,
they might have sought similar assurances. We do not know whether, if the
request had been pressed, the assurance would have been replicated, or whether
(more probably) the OFT would have reviewed the assurance to TMR in time to
leave open the possibility of appeal. In any event, grounds for administrative
complaint do not necessarily add up to a cause of action in law. Even accepting
that there was a breach of a legitimate expectation of equal treatment in the
failure to replicate the assurances given to TMR in 2008, that would not in
itself provide a basis for financial remedy in relation to the events of 2012,
nor the reversal of financial penalties which had by then been lawfully imposed
on the respondents and accepted by them.</a></p><a name="para42">

</span>Lord Dyson identified the critical issue as whether the 2012 decision -
that is, to honour the assurances given to TMR but not to do likewise for the
respondents - was “objectively justified”. In my view it makes no difference to
the result whether one applies a test of objective justification or of
rationality. I see this question as depending, not so much on whether the
giving of the assurance to TMR had been a mistake, but on the reality of the
position as reasonably perceived by the OFT in 2012.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not entirely clear what it was about the combination of
circumstances, summarised in Lord Dyson’s concluding paragraph, which led the
court to the view that a critical boundary of “unfairness” had been crossed.
Lord Dyson noted that the “only difference” between the respective positions of
TMR and of the respondents was that the “OFT had given the assurances to TMR in
2008, but not to the (respondents)”. But that was a potentially crucial
difference. All those who entered ER agreements were aware of the possibility
that other parties would appeal and might be successful. That was a risk the
respondents took. As Vos LJ said, they knew what they were doing and accepted
it with their eyes open. TMR did not. They sought and obtained an assurance on
which they claimed to have relied. In 2012 the OFT could reasonably take the
view that, if the assurance were not honoured, TMR would have had a strong case
for permission to appeal out of time, whereas the respondents did not (as the
Court of Appeal has since held). If objective justification were needed for the
OFT taking a different approach to TMR, that in my view was sufficient; nor was
it irrational for them to do so.</a></p><a name="para44">

</span>Cartel investigations are notoriously difficult without inside
information or the active co-operation of at least one participant and are not
necessarily straightforward even then. Early Resolution Agreements are a
standard tool at the disposal of competition authorities for settling them by
consent at an early stage after the investigation has been notified to those
under investigation. A party under investigation is offered the prospect of
settling the allegation on the basis of a negotiated admission and a discount
on the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed. Properly used, they
enable an investigation to be conducted expeditiously, economically and fairly
and are in principle in the public interest. The practice, however, raises
questions of some delicacy. A competition authority is not an ordinary
litigant, but a public authority charged with enforcing the law. It therefore
has wider responsibilities than the extraction of the maximum of penalties for
the minimum of effort. A party under investigation must not be subjected to
undue pressure to make admissions. Nor can it be deprived of any statutory
right of appeal against the ultimate decision.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The terms of the Early Resolution Agreements made with TMR, Gallaher,
Somerfield and Asda in this case followed the internal procedures laid down
within the OFT. They sought to balance these considerations by providing (i)
that the party under investigation would be entitled to terminate the agreement
at any time before receipt of the final decision, in which case it would forgo
the discount; and (ii) that notwithstanding its admission it would be entitled
to exercise its statutory right of appeal against the decision to the
Competition Appeal Tribunal, in which case the OFT would be at liberty to apply
to the Tribunal to increase the penalty and order the party under investigation
to pay the costs of the appeal in any event. It is fundamental to the efficacy
of such an agreement that subject to its terms it cuts short the investigation
of the counterparty by finally resolving the issues as between it and the OFT.
Where an Early Resolution Agreement is made with one party but the
investigation proceeds against others, the former is entitled to the benefit of
the discount or to the benefit of the continuing investigation and/or an appeal.
He is not entitled to both.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This carefully drawn balance was disturbed by the oral assurance
unwisely given by the responsible OFT officer Ms Branch to TMR, but not Gallaher
or Somerfield. The assurance was that a successful appeal by other parties on
liability “would result in no finding against [TMR]” and that in the event of a
successful appeal on penalty, “then OFT would apply any reduction to TMR”.
There was a successful appeal to the CAT by the parties who had not entered
into Early Resolution Agreements, and also by Asda, which had entered into one
but exercised its right to appeal. The appeal succeeded on the ground that the
OFT decision did not show that there was any anti-competitive object or effect.
That is a ground on which TMR, Gallaher and Somerfield would also have been
entitled to succeed if they had appealed. Therefore the effect of the assurance
was that TMR obtained the benefit of a successful appeal without itself having
to appeal and therefore without being exposed to the risk of losing the
discount if the appeal failed. The result was to put them in a better position
than Gallaher or Somerfield. Moreover, although Gallaher and Somerfield were
notified of the Early Resolution Agreement with TMR they were not told about
the oral assurance. Consequently, they were not prompted to ask for a similar
assurance.</a></p><a name="para48">

</span>The Court of Appeal held that the OFT’s failure to repay the penalties
to Gallaher and Somerfield, as they had to TMR, was a breach of a public law
duty to treat all those under investigation equally in the absence of some
objective ground for treating them differently. They considered that there was
no such ground.</a></p><a name="para49">

</span>I agree with Lord Carnwath’s analysis of the relevant legal principles.
In public law, as in most other areas of law, it is important not unnecessarily
to multiply categories. It tends to undermine the coherence of the law by
generating a mass of disparate special rules distinct from those applying in
public law generally or those which apply to neighbouring categories. To say
that a decision-maker must treat persons equally unless there is a reason for
treating them differently begs the question what counts as a valid reason for
treating them differently. Consistency of treatment is, as Lord Hoffmann
observed in <i>Matedeen v Pointu</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1998/9.html">[1999] 1 AC 98</a>, at para 9 “a general axiom
of rational behaviour”. The common law principle of equality is usually no more
than a particular application of the ordinary requirement of rationality
imposed on public authorities. Likewise, to say that the result of the decision
must be substantively fair, or at least not “conspicuously” unfair, begs the
question by what legal standard the fairness of the decision is to be assessed.
Absent a legitimate expectation of a different result arising from the
decision-maker’s statements or conduct, a decision which is rationally based on
relevant considerations is most unlikely to be unfair in any legally cognisable
sense. In the present case nothing that the OFT said or did could have given
rise to any other expectation than that it would act rationally. The questions
which this appeal poses are (i) whether the OFT acted rationally in giving the
assurance to TMR alone in 2008 and in repaying the penalty to TMR alone in
2012; and (ii) if not what are the consequences for Gallaher and Somerfield.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>As a statement of the ordinary legal consequences of a successful appeal
by other parties, the assurance given by Ms Branch was wrong. An appeal by one
party from a decision of the OFT on a cartel investigation is a distinct legal
proceeding whose outcome affects that party only: <i>Deutsche Bahn AG v Morgan
Advanced Materials plc (formerly Morgan Crucible Co plc) (European Commission
intervening)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/24.html">[2014] 2 All ER 785</a>, para 21, <i>Commission of the European
Communities v Assidomän Kraft Products AB </i>(Case C-310/97P) at paras 2-14, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1999/C31097P.html">[1999] 5 CMLR 1253</a> (“<i>Wood Pulp II</i>”), para 63. The assurance could therefore be
relevant only as a collateral undertaking to TMR that they would be treated
otherwise than in accordance with the general law. This was a mistake, as both
courts below have recognised. It was a mistake not because Ms Branch did not
intend to give the assurance or did not know what she was doing. It was a
mistake because it was inconsistent with the OFT’s policy of non-discrimination,
as well as with the terms of the Early Resolution Agreement under discussion,
and more generally with the purpose of the early resolution procedure.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That, however, cannot affect the position of Gallaher or Somerfield, for
substantially the reason given by the Court of Appeal when they held that Gallaher
and Somerfield were not entitled to appeal the OFT’s decision out of time after
the other appeals had succeeded. Save in “exceptional circumstances”, such an
appeal must be brought within two months of the OFT’s final decision. The Court
of Appeal held that there were no exceptional circumstances. This was because
each of them had entered into a distinct agreement which was intended finally
to resolve the issues the subject of the appeals, subject only to the right
conferred by the agreement to terminate the agreement before a final decision
or to appeal afterwards. They had invoked neither condition, thus accepting the
risk that they would not benefit if the appeal succeeded but ensuring that they
would retain the benefit of the discount if it failed. Finality and certainty
required that they should live with the consequences: see <i>Office of</i> <i>Fair
Trading v Somerfield Stores Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/400.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 400</a>, esp at paras 33, 38,
41 and 45.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that no corresponding assurance was given to Gallaher or
Somerfield makes no difference to this analysis. This was not a zero sum game,
like the tender process considered in <i>R v National Lottery Commission, Ex p
Camelot Group Plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2000/391.html">[2001] EMLR 3</a>. The benefit to TMR was in no sense given
at their expense. Nor does it make any difference that the oral assurance was
not disclosed to them. If it had been, they might well have asked for a similar
assurance for themselves. But they would have had no right to one. As a matter
of principle, the OFT’s mistake was that they gave the assurance to TMR, not
that they failed to give it to Gallaher and Somerfield. As a matter of fact, if
Gallaher and Somerfield had asked for a similar assurance, there is no reason
to suppose that the OFT would have made the same mistake again. It is at least
as likely that such a request would have provoked a reassessment of the
assurance given to TMR, followed by its withdrawal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against that background, I turn to the 2012 decision which the Court of
Appeal, correctly as I think, regarded as the relevant one. Was it irrational
to repay the penalty to TMR after the appeal but not to Gallaher or Somerfield?
In my opinion it was not, because although the decision to repay TMR also was
discriminatory, the discrimination was objectively justified.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To see why this is so, it is necessary to look more carefully at the
basis on which the OFT agreed to repay the penalty to TMR in 2012. The OFT’s
assurance had been that in the event of a successful appeal by another party on
liability they would withdraw as against TMR the finding of unlawfulness made
in their decision. However, they refused to do that. It would have been
contrary to the terms of the Early Resolution Agreement. Instead, they recognised
that they had slipped up in giving the assurance. As a result, first, TMR would
be certain to get permission to appeal out of time, because the assurance had
made it unnecessary for them to appeal in time; and, secondly, their appeal
would have been bound to succeed, because the ground on which the other appeals
had succeeded applied equally to them. Accordingly, the OFT settled with TMR on
the only realistic basis. Gallaher and Somerfield were not in the same
position. The OFT had not slipped up in their case. They had no basis for a
late appeal, as indeed the Court of Appeal subsequently held. There was nothing
as between them and the OFT to be settled. Because TMR had received the oral
assurance and on that basis foregone an appeal which would certainly have
succeeded, the repayment of the penalty to them was in no sense a windfall. But
it would be a windfall if a corresponding repayment were now to be made to
Gallaher and Somerfield, who forewent their appeal by their own decision on an
entirely different basis.</a></p><a name="para56">

</span>I agree that this appeal should be allowed, and with Lord Carnwath’s
analysis of the relevant legal principles. As he concludes, the OFT’s decision
to honour the assurance given to TMR, but not to replicate it in favour of the
respondents, was both objectively justified and a rational response to the
predicament which it faced.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2008 the OFT gave an assurance to TMR about extending to it the
benefit of any successful appeal by another party which the evidence shows (and
the courts below rightly held) was the result of a mistake. It had been
intended as a statement of what the OFT then thought, without proper
consideration of the question, and in particular the finality principle, would
be the legal consequence for TMR of a successful appeal by another party. It
had not been intended to confer some special benefit upon TMR, and might have
been unthinkingly replicated in favour of other parties negotiating ERAs if any
had asked the same question, but none did.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2012, when the consequences of the mistaken assurance came home to
roost, the OFT was faced, at least in theory, with three unpalatable
alternatives:</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It could go back on the assurance to TMR, and refuse any similar benefit
to any other party.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It could honour the assurance to TMR, and extend it to the respondents
and any other party in a similar position.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It could honour all or part of the assurance to TMR but not extend it to
any other party.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Option (a) was unsatisfactory because it would almost certainly have led
to TMR (but not the respondents) obtaining permission to appeal out of time,
and to a wholly successful appeal. This would have been an even better outcome
for TMR than that which the OFT provided by agreement, because the agreement
did not abandon the finding of unlawfulness against TMR in the decision.
Furthermore the complaint by the respondents of having been treated differently
in 2008 would have remained. Option (b) would have involved the replication of
a mistake at very large cost to the public purse, in favour of parties who
neither received nor relied upon a similar assurance. Option (c) would involve
treating the respondents differently, but would at least not involve the
replication of a mistake.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These claims seek judicial review of the OFT’s choice of option (c).
Where a public authority has a choice of this kind, and one of the options
avoids replicating an earlier mistake, but at some cost to equal treatment, the
choice is one for the authority, not for the court, for the reasons which Lord
Carnwath gives, subject to the usual constraints of lawfulness and rationality.
If, but only if, the authority acts outside those constraints will its choice
be subject to judicial review.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case I do not consider that the OFT’s response to its
predicament transgressed those boundaries. The fact that the giving of the
assurance to TMR in 2008 was a mistake, that its withdrawal in 2012 would be
likely to leave TMR even better off than if the assurance was honoured, and
that the respondents had neither received or relied upon any similar assurance
seem to me, taken in combination, to amount to a powerful objective
justification for unequal treatment, as between TMR and the respondents. On any
view the OFT made a rational choice between unpalatable alternatives, with
which the court should not interfere.</a></p><a name="para63">
