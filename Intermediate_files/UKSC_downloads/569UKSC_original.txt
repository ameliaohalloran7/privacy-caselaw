<p class="NewSpeech">LORD CARNWATH: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom
Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd-Jones agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When a local planning authority against the advice of its own
professional advisers grants permission for a controversial development, what
legal duty, if any, does it have to state the reasons for its decision, and in
how much detail? Is such a duty to be found in statutory sources, European or
domestic, or in the common law? And what are the legal consequences of a breach
of the duty?</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Those issues are presented by this appeal in a particularly striking
form. The context is a proposal for major development to the west of Dover, on
two sites referred to as Western Heights and Farthingloe. The latter is within
the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Western Heights is a
prominent hilltop overlooking Dover, dominated by a series of fortifications
dating from the Napoleonic wars, including the so-called “Drop Redoubt”. The
site is a scheduled monument. Farthingloe is in a long valley between the A20
and the B2001 to the west of Western Heights, and comprises 155 hectares of
agricultural and scrubland.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The application</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The application for planning permission was submitted by the second
appellant (“CGI”) to the local planning authority, the Dover District Council
(“the Council”), on 13 May 2012. The principal elements were: 521 residential
units and a 90 apartment retirement “village” at Farthingloe; 31 residential
units and a hotel and conference centre at Western Heights; and conversion of
the Drop Redoubt into a visitor centre and museum. A payment of £5m for the
improvements to heritage assets, to be funded from the profits of the
residential development, was to be secured by a planning agreement. The development
was categorised as “EIA development” for the purpose of the relevant
regulations (Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment)
Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1824) regulation 2(1)), and was accordingly
accompanied by an environmental statement.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The proposal attracted strong support and strong opposition. Some saw it
as offering a much-needed boost to the local economy. Thus, for example, the South
East Local Enterprise Partnership commented:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The proposals represent a major
opportunity for both Dover and the wider tourism and visitor economy of East
Kent at a time of major challenges facing the local economy. In the absence of
likely public-sector funding to act as a catalyst for change it is essential
that the private sector is encouraged to move forward with confidence and
business can aid recovery. Approval of the application would be timely in
demonstrating that Dover is open for business and investment. Refusal would
send out all the wrong messages to investors.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Others (including the present respondents, CPRE Kent) saw
it as a serious and unjustified breach of national policy. Thus the AONB
Executive said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Farthingloe valley in the
Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is an enormous asset to Dover.
This dry chalk valley provides a memorable approach to the town, with glimpses
of Dover castle, as well as a green setting for both the town and the Western
Heights available for all to enjoy. The proposed development of over 500 houses
in a particularly prominent area of the valley would irreparably damage this
nationally protected landscape. It would cause significant harm to the special
character and the natural beauty of the AONB. No meaningful mitigation would be
possible. The scheme is wholly contrary to national and local policy and is a
major challenge to the Government’s purposes for AONB designation. We have
found no other housing development nationally on a similar scale which has been
approved in an AONB …”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The planning officers’ report</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These views along with many others on both sides were faithfully
summarised in the officers’ report to the Planning Committee, circulated on 7
June 2013. The report, under the name of the Head of Regeneration and
Development, is a remarkable document. It runs to some 135 pages with appendices.
It contains a comprehensive exposition of the various elements of the proposed
development, the responses to consultation public and private, and the
applicable national and local policies, followed by a detailed appraisal of the

</span>The principal change recommended by the officers was the exclusion from
the development at Farthingloe of a “safeguarded area” of some 2ha in the
south-west (in the more prominent sector known as FL-B), where “officers
consider the landscape harm … most acute”; and the consequent reduction of the
number of houses at Farthingloe from 521 to 365. The Council’s economic
advisers, Smiths Gore, had advised that the reduction would not jeopardise the
viability of the scheme or the intended financial contributions (officers’
report paras 2.216, 2.443, 2.445). One aspect of Smiths Gore’s advice was to
suggest a reduction in the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) rating from Code 4
to Code 3, which would not only deliver a viable development but would also
achieve “a more marketable and higher quality housing scheme … this being
important to help diversify and improve the Dover housing offer” (paras 2.217,
2.443). Among other recommended conditions, it was proposed that the provision
of the hotel should be secured by requiring it to be commenced before one of
the development phases (para 2.131(iii)).</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>In a section of the report headed “NPPF (para 116) review”, reference
was made to that paragraph of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF),
which indicates that major development in an AONB should be permitted “only in
exceptional circumstances and where a public interest can be demonstrated”. The
officers regarded the level of harm to the AONB as “significant”, particularly
to the south-west of sector FL-B where “built development on the elevated and
exposed terrain would seriously compromise the landscape character”. They
concluded:</a></p><a name="para7">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“2.447 Nevertheless it is your officers’ opinion
that offsetting the landscape harm by the modifications outlined in this report
would shift the planning balance in favour of the economic and other national
benefits of the application. The local economic issues and specific
circumstances of this case … are considered to provide a finely balanced
exceptional justification for this major AONB development, the benefits of
which would be in the public interest. Essential to this conclusion would be
seeking all the recommended conditions (changes) and ensuring (by condition /
section 106 agreement) the deliverability of all the relevant application
‘benefits’. The rationale for the application is as a composite package, and
any permission should therefore be framed to ensure the emergence of the proposals
in a structured and comprehensive fashion.”</p>

</span>It was noted that the applicant had not yet been given an opportunity to
comment on these proposed changes. If they were supported in principle by the
Committee, it was suggested that they might delegate to officers to discuss
with the applicant “any minor variation of the proposed residential quantum”,
and the precise boundaries of the safeguarded area, although it was “not
envisaged that this should lead to any notable change in the recommended
approach” (para 2.448). On balance their conclusion in this case was that the
application would, as “a single comprehensive scheme”, support rather than work
against the overall objectives of sustainable development as defined by the
NPPF (para 2.454).</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:25.45pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“… the officer position is that the conditions / changes
as set out in this report (informed by independent legal and financial
viability advice) are well founded and that all are necessary to deliver the
right composite package, including the economic benefits, so that an on balance
recommendation of approval can reasonably be made.” (para 2.457)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The report ended with a recommendation for the grant of
conditional planning permission (part outline, part full) for the various elements
of the proposal, but with a limit of 365 residential units at Farthingloe, and
subject to the completion of a planning agreement (under section 106 of the
Town and Country Planning Act 1990) to secure the proposed benefits including the
hotel and conference centre.</p>

</span>The report was shown to the applicants. Their consultants, BNP Paribas,
wrote on 11 September, expressing “fundamental” disagreement with Smiths Gore’s
appraisal of viability. They commented on the proposed reduction to 365 houses:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We have re-run our appraisals to
test the impact of the removal of 156 units, as suggested by Smiths Gore. The
result is to turn a positive land value of £5.85m to a negative land value of
-£3.03m. On the basis of this result, the scheme would not secure funding and
could not proceed.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:72.0pt">For the avoidance of doubt, we do not agree with the
planning officer’s assessment that the benefits provided by the Application
scheme could also be provided by the sensitivity analysis mooted by Smiths
Gore. Indeed, our view is that such a scheme would not be capable of providing
the benefits offered and could not proceed as it would be incapable of
providing a competitive return to the landowner and developers, as required by
the National Planning Policy Framework.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">They also disagreed with the suggestion that the proposed
changes would make the scheme more marketable. Although the letter was not seen
by the members of the committee (other than the chairman), its effect and
Smiths Gore’s response were summarised at the meeting (see below).</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The Committee meeting</b></p>

</span>The application was considered by the Planning Committee on 13 June
2013. The very full minutes record that the meeting started at 6.00 pm and
ended at 9.38 pm, with a short break at 9.00 pm following the main vote for the
officers to make amendments to their recommendation. (Also on the agenda was
one other minor planning application which was dealt with first.) On the
Farthingloe application there were contributions by four members of the public
(two for and two against). There was a detailed presentation by the officers of
the proposals and the issues, during which reference was made to the issue of
viability and the BNP Paribas letter, the effect of which was summarised. The
minute continued:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Principal Planner advised the
Committee that, having considered the further views of BNP Paribas, Smiths Gore
stood by their analysis that a lower density scheme would be viable and would
deliver the same monetary benefits as currently on offer. Officers therefore
recommended that a lower density scheme should be approved as it was viable,
not excessive for the site and would be compliant with the Core Strategy.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After the officers’ presentation, five members were recorded as speaking
in favour of the proposal, and one against. Another expressed concern about the
security of the proposed payment of £5m. The views of three named supporters
were expressed collectively; they saw it as “a rare opportunity for
regeneration and investment”, and a “courageous step … necessary to give Dover’s
young people a future”; of the proposed amendments they said:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“…, it was felt that the
application should not be restricted in the way proposed in the recommendation
as this could jeopardise the viability of the scheme, deter other developers
and be less effective in delivering the economic benefits. The Committee had to
assess whether the advantages outweighed the harm that would be caused to the
AONB. When seen from the ground and with effective screening, it was believed
that this could be minimised. In these exceptional circumstances it was
considered that the advantages did outweigh the harmful impact on the AONB.”</p>

</span>At the end of the discussion a motion was proposed that the officers’
recommendation be approved but subject to amendment of the number of houses
from 365 to 521 as proposed in the application. The motion was carried (the
voting is not recorded). The meeting was adjourned for 25 minutes to enable the
officers to re-word their recommendation with consequential amendments. A vote
was then taken on the amended recommendation, which was approved.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>On 18 December 2014 the application returned to the planning committee
with an updated officers’ report. The introduction to the report made clear
that its purpose was, not to revisit the decision to grant permission in the
previous year, but to update the committee on the section 106 agreement, and to
provide “an assessment of planning considerations which have emerged since the
resolution to grant planning permission” (para 3). The report on the section
106 agreement confirmed that, contrary to the officers’ recommendation in June
2013, there was no obligation linking the provision of the hotel to the phasing
of the residential development:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The section 106 is drafted in
accordance with the Committee resolution which places no obligation on the applicant
to provide the hotel at any point in time and there is no obligation to provide
the hotel at any stage during the build-out of other development proposed in
the application. Rather, the objective of the section 106 is to provide the
opportunity for a quality hotel to come forward.” (para 35)</p>

</span>Although Mr Cameron drew our attention to some aspects of this report,
it does not seem to have been relied on in the courts below. Mitting J (para 6)
merely noted that the revisions were not material to the issues which arose in
the case. The December meeting was not mentioned by the Court of Appeal. I can
find nothing in the report or minutes to suggest an intention to revisit the
substance of the decision of principle made in June 2013, nor which throws further
light on the reasons for that decision. The committee resolved to grant
permission subject to the completion of the section 106 agreement.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>The agreement was executed on 1 April 2015, and planning permission was
granted on the same day. The notification of grant is a substantial document,
running to more than 50 pages, including a long list of approved documents
supporting the application, and detailing 183 conditions. It concludes with a
note (“for the avoidance of doubt”) that the Environmental Statement
accompanying the application has been taken into account. But it contains no
reference to any obligation to give reasons under the EIA regulations (see
below), nor any formal statement of the reasons for the grant.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>The present proceedings for judicial review, on a number of grounds
including lack of reasons, were heard by Mitting J at a rolled-up hearing in
December 2015, and were dismissed by him on 16 December: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/3808.html">[2015] EWHC 3808 (Admin)</a>. Permission to appeal was granted solely on the issue of reasons. On 16
September 2016 the Court of Appeal (Laws and Simon LJJ) allowed the appeal and
quashed the permission: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/936.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 936</a>.</p>

</span>Laws LJ noted the controversy at the Bar as to the standard of reasons
required (para 18). He pointed to three particular factors as calling for clear
reasons in this case: the “pressing nature” of the AONB policy as expressed in
the NPPF para 115-6 (“the highest status of protection”); the departure from
the officers’ recommendation; and the specific duty imposed by the EIA
regulations (paras 21-23). Although he noted the relative “thinness” of the
material available to the committee on the viability issue, he relied
principally on the failure of the committee to assess and explain the degree of
harm to the AONB, having regard to the strictness of the policy and the strong
view of harm taken by the officers (paras 29-30). The only reference to this
issue in the minutes spoke of the need to assess whether the advantages
“outweighed” the harm to the AONB, wrongly implying that it was simply a
question of “striking a balance”. Further the reference to “minimising the
harm” by “effective screening” took no account of the officers’ view that the
change of levels to the east would mean that “over time, screening would be
largely ineffective”.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>In granting permission to appeal (on 2 March 2017), this court indicated
that it would wish to consider generally the sources, nature and extent of a

</span>The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 itself says nothing about the
giving of reasons for planning decisions. The 1990 Act requires the decision
(inter alia) to be made having regard to the development plan and other
material considerations (section 70(2)). The Planning and Compulsory Purchase
Act 2004 is more specific in requiring the decision to be made in accordance
with the development plan “unless material considerations indicate otherwise”
(section 38(6); see <i>Hopkins Homes Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/37.html">[2017] 1 WLR 1865</a>, para 7). But it does not in terms

justify such a departure.</p>

</span>The non-statutory National Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”) (itself
treated as a “material consideration” for these purposes: <i>ibid </i>paras
10-21) provides comprehensive guidance to local planning authorities on the
handling of individual planning applications. Paragraph 14 with footnote 9
notes, as an exception to the general presumption in favour of permission,
“specific policies” by which “development is restricted”; including those
relating to protected sites under the Birds and Habitats Directives, Green Belts,
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and National Parks. In practice such
policy designations are likely to be reflected also in the statutory
development plan, so that section 38(6) will come into play.</a></p><a name="para22">

</span>Local objectors have no right to call for a public inquiry into a
planning appeal. Section 79(2) provides that before determining an appeal the
Secretary of State shall “if either the appellant or the local planning
authority so wish” give them an opportunity of appearing before a person
appointed by the Secretary of State. If an inquiry is held the right of other
parties to appear is determined by the inquiries procedure rules (see, in
respect of Secretary of State decisions, the Town and Country Planning
(Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000 (SI 2000/1624) rule 11). Following
an inquiry, the Secretary of State must “notify his decision on an application
or an appeal and his reasons for it in writing” to “all persons entitled to
appear at the inquiry who did appear, ... and any other person who, having
appeared at the inquiry, has asked to be notified of the decision” (ibid rule
18(1)). Equivalent duties are applied under the separate rules dealing with
decisions by inspectors and decisions following hearings.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>In <i>Save Britain’s Heritage v Number 1 Poultry Ltd </i>[1991] 1 WLR
153, Lord Bridge said of the duty imposed by statute on the Secretary of State:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That they should be required to
state their reasons is a salutary safeguard to enable interested parties to
know that the decision has been taken on relevant and rational grounds and that
any applicable statutory criteria have been observed. It is the analogue in
administrative law of the common law’s requirement that justice should not only
be done, but also be seen to be done.” (p 170)</p>

</span>There is no corresponding statutory rule applying to decisions following
a written representations appeal. However, it is the practice for a fully
reasoned decision to be given. It has been accepted (on behalf of the Secretary
of State, and by the Administrative Court) that there is an enforceable duty,
said to arise “… either from the principles of procedural fairness … or from
the legitimate expectation generated by the Secretary of State’s long-established
practice …” (<i>Martin v Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/3435.html">[2015] EWHC 3435 (Admin)</a> para 51 per Lindblom LJ).</p>

</span><i>Refusals and conditions </i>It has long been the case that local
planning authorities must give reasons for refusing permission or imposing
conditions. Historically this appears to have been the corollary of the fact
that in those cases there is a statutory right of appeal against the refusal or
the conditions. The current order (Town and Country Planning (Development
Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (SI 2015/595) article 35(1))
provides that the authority in their decision notice must state “clearly and
precisely their full reasons”.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span><i>Grant of permission </i>Until 2003 there was no statutory duty on
local planning authorities to give reasons for the grant of permission as such.
There was then a change of thinking, as Sullivan J explained (<i>R (Wall) v
Brighton and Hove City Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/2582.html">[2004] EWHC 2582 (Admin)</a>, para 52):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Over the years the public was
first enabled and then encouraged to participate in the decision-making
process. The fact that, having participated, the public was not entitled to be
told what the local planning authority’s reasons were, if planning permission
was granted, was increasingly perceived as a justifiable source of grievance,
which undermined confidence in the planning system …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Accordingly, between 2003 and 2013, local planning
authorities were required to include in the notice of the decision “a summary
of their reasons for the grant of permission” and “a summary of the policies
and proposals in the development plan which are relevant to the decision” (see
Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (England) (Amendment)
Order 2003 (SI 2003/2047) article 5; Town and Country Planning (Development
Management Procedure) (England) Order 2010 (SI 2010/2184) article 31).</p>

</span>This duty was repealed as from 25 June 2013 (Town and Country Planning
(Development Management Procedure) (England) (Amendment) Order 2013 (SI
2013/1238) article 7). The Explanatory Memorandum (paras 7.17-20) indicated
that this was a response to suggestions that the duty had become “burdensome
and unnecessary”, and having regard to the fact that officer reports “typically
provide far more detail on the logic and reasoning behind a particular decision
than a decision notice”, so that the requirement to provide a summary “adds

development, at whatever level the decision is taken. EIA development is defined
as development listed in Schedule 1 or 2 to the Regulations, in the latter case
if the development is “likely to have significant effects on the environment by
virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location.” Decision-makers must
not grant planning permission “unless they have first taken the environmental
information into consideration”, and “they shall state in their decision that
they have done so” (EIA regulations regulation 3(4)). “Environmental
information” is defined as:</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the environmental statement,
including any further information and any other information, any
representations made by anybody required by these Regulations to be invited to

the consequent need for effective public participation, access to information,
transparency in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.</a></p><a name="para33">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The reasons for a decision must
be intelligible and they must be adequate. They must enable the reader to
understand why the matter was decided as it was and what conclusions were
reached on the ‘principal important controversial issues’, disclosing how any
issue of law or fact was resolved. Reasons can be briefly stated, the degree of
particularity required depending entirely on the nature of the issues falling
for decision. The reasoning must not give rise to a substantial doubt as to
whether the decision-maker erred in law, for example by misunderstanding some
relevant policy or some other important matter or by failing to reach a
rational decision on relevant grounds. But such adverse inference will not
readily be drawn. The reasons need refer only to the main issues in the
dispute, not to every material consideration. They should enable disappointed
developers to assess their prospects of obtaining some alternative development
permission, or, as the case may be, their unsuccessful opponents to understand
how the policy or approach underlying the grant of permission may impact upon
future such applications. Decision letters must be read in a straightforward
manner, recognising that they are addressed to parties well aware of the issues
involved and the arguments advanced. A reasons challenge will only succeed if
the party aggrieved can satisfy the court that he has genuinely been
substantially prejudiced by the failure to provide an adequately reasoned
decision.”</p>

</span>There has been some debate about whether Lord Brown’s words are
applicable to a decision by a local planning authority, rather than the
Secretary of State or an inspector. It is true that the case concerned a
statutory challenge to the decision of the Secretary of State on a planning appeal.
However, the authorities reviewed by Lord Brown were not confined to such
cases. They included, for example, the decision of the House of Lords upholding
the short reasons given by Westminster City Council explaining the office
policies in its development plan (<i>Westminster City Council v Great Portland
Estates plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1984/10.html">[1985] AC 661</a>, 671-673). Lord Scarman adopted the guidance of
earlier cases at first instance, not limited to planning cases (eg <i>In re
Poyser and Mills’ Arbitration</i> [1964] 2 QB 467, 478), that the reasons must
be “proper, adequate and intelligible” and can be “briefly stated” (p 673E-G).
Similarly local planning authorities are able to give relatively short reasons
for refusals of planning permission without any suggestion that they are
inadequate.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the context of the EIA regulations, Mr Reed QC (for CGI) relied on
the fact that under Regulation 24(1)(c)(ii) the duty is limited to the “main”
reasons. He drew an analogy with the former duty of local planning authorities
to provide “summary” reasons for the grant of permission, which was treated as
imposing a less onerous standard than that considered in <i>Porter</i>. Thus in
<i>R (Siraj) v Kirklees Metropolitan Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1286.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 1286</a>, Sullivan
LJ said “summary reasons” in that context could not be equated with reasons in
a Secretary of State’s decision-letter:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… a decision letter is intended
to be a ‘stand-alone’ document which contains a full explanation of the
Secretary of State’s reasons for allowing or dismissing an appeal. By their
very nature a local planning authority’s summary reasons for granting planning
permission do not present a full account of the local planning authority’s
decision making process.” (para 14)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Reed sought to apply this thinking to the duty to give the “main
reasons” under the EIA regulations. He referred to <i>R (Cherkley Campaign Ltd)
v Mole Valley District Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/567.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 567</a>, para 70, where counsel
was recorded as conceding (apparently without demur from the court) that the
duty under the EIA was no higher than the duty to give “summary” reasons under
domestic planning legislation. I am unable to accept the analogy. I do not read
the reference in the EIA regulations to the “main” reasons as materially
limiting the ordinary duty in such cases. It is no different in substance from
Lord Brown’s reference in <i>Porter </i>to the need to refer only to “the main
issues in the dispute”. To my mind the guidance in <i>Porter </i>is equally
relevant in the EIA context.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lang J in <i>R (Hawksworth Securities plc v Peterborough City Council</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1870.html">[2016] EWHC 1870 (Admin)</a> made a more general point about what she saw as the
difference between a planning inspector conducting an “adversarial procedure,
akin to court or tribunal proceedings”, contrasted with a local planning
authority as an administrative body, determining an individual application:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para87">“Its reasons ought
to state why planning permission was granted, usually by reference to the
relevant planning policies.</a> But it is not conducting a formal adjudication
in a dispute between the applicant for planning permission and objectors, and
so it is not required to give reasons for rejecting the representations made by
those who object to the grant of planning permission.” (para 87)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not persuaded that the difference between the two processes bears
such significance. In both the decision-maker may have to take into account and
deal fairly with a wide range of differing views and interests, and reach a
reasoned conclusion on them. Where there is a legal requirement to give
reasons, what is needed is an adequate explanation of the ultimate decision.
The content of that duty should not in principle turn on differences in the
procedures by which it is arrived at. Local planning authorities are under an
unqualified statutory duty to give reasons for refusing permission. There is no
reason in principle why the duty to give reasons for grant of permission should
become any more onerous.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is of course the important difference that, as Sullivan J pointed
out in <i>Siraj</i>, the decision-letter of the Secretary of State or a
planning inspector is designed as a stand-alone document setting out all the
relevant background material and policies, before reaching a reasoned
conclusion. In the case of a decision of the local planning authority that
function will normally be performed by the planning officers’ report. If their
recommendation is accepted by the members, no further reasons may be needed.
Even if it is not accepted, it may normally be enough for the committee’s
statement of reasons to be limited to the points of difference. However the
essence of the duty remains the same, as does the issue for the court: that is,
in the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR, whether the information so provided by
the authority leaves room for “genuine doubt … as to what (it) has decided and
why”.</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Legal remedies</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the case of a decision by the Secretary of State or a planning
inspector, the 1990 Act provides for a statutory challenge under section 288,
on the grounds that the decision was not within the powers of the Act, or that
a “relevant requirement” (which includes a requirement under the inquiries
procedure rules to give notice of the decision and the reasons for it) had not
been complied with. In the latter case the court must be satisfied also that “the
interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced” by the failure (section
288(5)(b)).</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I note that in the <i>Save </i>case, Lord Bridge identified a single
question:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There are in truth not two
separate questions: (1) were the reasons adequate? (2) if not, were the
interests of the applicant substantially prejudiced thereby? The single
indivisible question, in my opinion, which the court must ask itself whenever a
planning decision is challenged on the ground of a failure to give reasons is
whether the interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced by
the deficiency of the reasons given.” (p 167D-E)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">I am not convinced with respect that it is helpful so to
conflate the two parts of the statutory formula. Until one has decided on the
nature of the breach of the statutory requirements, it is difficult to
determine the nature and extent of any prejudice. However, that passage needs to
be read in the context of what follows (p 168), which makes clear that Lord
Bridge’s principal concern was to emphasise, contrary to the apparent
implication of the judgment of Woolf LJ in the Court of Appeal, that the burden
lay on the applicant to establish both parts of the statutory test.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Save </i>itself, the decision of the House ultimately turned on
the adequacy of the reasons for departing from the policy, rather than lack of
prejudice. Lord Bridge accepted that -</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… an opponent of development, whether
the local planning authority or some unofficial body like Save, may be
substantially prejudiced by a decision to grant permission in which the
planning considerations on which the decision is based, particularly if they
relate to planning policy, are not explained sufficiently clearly to indicate
what, if any, impact they may have in relation to the decision of future
applications.” (p 167H)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The same point is picked up in Lord Brown’s summary. Lord
Bridge did not, as I understand him, dissent from the view of the Court of
Appeal that, had Save been able to establish a material defect of reasoning,
the appropriate remedy was to quash the permission.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Cameron QC (for the Council) argued that a different approach should
apply to a breach of the EIA duty taken on its own. Relying on the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Richardson) v North Yorkshire County Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1860.html">[2004] 1 WLR 1920</a>, he argued that in that context a mere declaration of the breach was
sufficient. Indeed before Mitting J (para 22) this point was conceded by Mr
Westaway for CPRE Kent. Although the point was raised in argument in the Court
of Appeal, Laws LJ apparently found it unnecessary to address the issue,
perhaps because he saw the EIA duty, not as a free-standing duty, but as no more
than one of the factors relevant to the obligation to give reasons in this
case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Richardson</i>, notwithstanding a clear failure to provide a
statement of reasons as required by regulation 21 of the EIA regulations then
in force (</a><a name="para2">Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact
Assessment) (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 1999</a>), the Court of Appeal
held that the appropriate remedy was, not to quash the decision itself, but to
make a mandatory order for the required statement to be provided. In the
leading judgment, Simon Brown LJ (para 33) adopted the reasoning of Richards J
(at first instance), who had said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … the first and most
important point in the present case is that regulation 21(1) looks to the
position <i>after</i> the grant of planning permission. It is concerned with
making information available to the public as to what has been decided and why
it has been decided, rather than laying down requirements for the
decision-making process itself. It implements the obligation in article 9(1) of
the directive to make information available to the public ‘when a decision to
grant … development consent<i> has been taken</i>’ (emphasis added). That is to
be contrasted with article 2(1) of the Directive, which lays down requirements
as to what must be done <i>before</i> the grant of planning permission (which
may be granted only after a prior assessment of significant environmental
effects).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the
requirement focuses on the availability of information for public inspection
after the decision has been made, rather than on the decision-making process,
leads me to the view that a breach of regulation 21(1) ought not to lead
necessarily to the quashing of the decision itself. A breach should be capable
in principle of being remedied, and the legislative purpose achieved, by a
mandatory order requiring the authority to make available a statement at the
place, and containing the information, specified in the regulation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the judges concerned, I would decline to follow that
reasoning. I find the distinction drawn between notification of the decision,
and of the reasons on which it is based, artificial and unconvincing. In the
regulations (as in the Aarhus Convention, which is now expressly referred to in
the Directive) the provision of reasons is an intrinsic part of the procedure,
essential to ensure effective public participation. I would not necessarily
disagree with the court’s disposal of the appeal in <i>Richardson</i>.<i> </i>Although
the committee had not given its own reasons, it had granted permission in
accordance with the recommendation in the officer’s report, and could be taken
to have adopted its reasoning. Simon Brown LJ (para 35) referred with approval
to the comment of Sullivan J (<i>R v Mendip District Council, Ex p Fabre </i>(2000)
80 P &amp; CR 500, 511) that in such a case -</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the reasonable inference is
that the members did so for the reasons advanced by the officer, unless of
course there is some indication to the contrary.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is perhaps also relevant that the court was faced with a somewhat
extreme submission (based on observations of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Berkeley v
Secretary of State for the Environment</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/36.html">[2001] 2 AC 603</a>, 616-617), that in
respect of a breach of an EU directive the court had no choice in the matter;
it was -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… simply not permitted to regard
a breach of the implementing regulations as curable other than by the outright
quashing of the development permission granted.” (para 38)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Not surprisingly the court found that an unattractive
proposition. However, it is now clear, following recent judgments of this court,
that even in respect of a breach of an EU directive the powers of the court are
not so restricted:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the court retains a discretion
to refuse relief if the applicant has been able in practice to enjoy the rights
conferred by European legislation, and there has been no substantial prejudice
(per Lord Carnwath, (<i>R (Champion) v North Norfolk District Council &amp;
Anor</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/52.html">[2015] UKSC 52</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/52.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3710</a>, para 54, following <i>Walton v

<p class="ParaLevel1">In <i>Champion </i>itself it was held that this test was
met: given that the environmental issues were of no particular complexity or
novelty; there was only one issue of substance on which each of the statutory
agencies had satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the proposed measures;
the public had been fully involved; and Mr Champion himself having been given
the opportunity to raise any specific points of concern but having been unable
to do so (para 60).</p>

length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of
ascertaining whether this is an instance where the decision-making process has
gone astray. I think it important that there should be an effective means of
detecting the kind of error which would entitle the court to intervene, and in
practice I regard it as necessary for this purpose that the reasoning of the
Home Secretary should be disclosed. If there is any difference between the
penal element recommended by the judges and actually imposed by the Home Secretary,
this reasoning is bound to include, either explicitly or implicitly, a reason
why the Home Secretary has taken a different view …” (p 565G-H per Lord
Mustill)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">It is to be noted that a principal justification for
imposing the duty was seen as the need to reveal any such error as would
entitle the court to intervene, and so make effective the right to challenge
the decision by judicial review.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, in the planning context, the Court of Appeal has held that a
local planning authority generally is under no common law duty to give reasons
for the grant of planning permission (<i>R v Aylesbury Vale District Council,
Ex p Chaplin </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/2262.html">[1997] EWCA Civ 2262</a>, (1998) 76 P &amp; CR 207, 211-212 per Pill LJ). Although this
general principle was reaffirmed recently in <i>Oakley v South Cambridgeshire
District Council </i>[2017] 2 P &amp; CR 4, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/71.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 71</a>, the court held that a duty did
arise in the particular circumstances of that case: where the development <a name="para57">would have a “significant and lasting impact on the local community</a>”,
and involved a substantial departure from Green Belt and development plan
policies, and where the committee had disagreed with its officers’
recommendations. Of the last point, Elias LJ (giving the leading judgment, with
which Patten LJ agreed) said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The significance of that fact is
not simply that it will often leave the reasoning obscure. In addition, the
fact that the committee is disagreeing with a careful and clear recommendation
from a highly experienced officer on a matter of such potential significance to
very many people suggests that some explanation is required … the dictates of
good administration and the need for transparency are particularly strong here,
and they reinforce the justification for imposing the common law duty.” (para
61)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">His conclusion was reinforced by reference to the United
Kingdom’s obligations under the Aarhus Convention (para 62; see to similar
effect my own comments on the relevance of the Convention, in <i>Walton v
Scottish Ministers</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/44.html">[2012] UKSC 44</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/44.html">[2013] PTSR 51</a>, para 100). Sales LJ
agreed with the result, but expressed concern that the imposition of such
duties “might deter otherwise public-spirited volunteers” from council duties,
and might also introduce “an unwelcome element of delay into the planning
system” (para 76).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Cameron QC (for the Council) submitted that this decision should be
“treated with care”, against the background of the government’s decision in
2013 to abrogate the statutory duty to give reasons for grant of permission,
planning law being a creature of statute (see <i>Hopkins Homes Ltd v Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/37.html">[2017] 1 WLR 1865</a>, para 20).
The factors identified by Elias LJ could arise in many cases, and lead to the
common law duty becoming a general rule. He asked us to prefer the view of Lang
J (<i>R (Hawksworth Securities plc) v Peterborough City Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1870.html">[2016] EWHC 1870 (Admin)</a>, para 81) that a common law duty to give reasons would arise only
“exceptionally” and that “generally, the requirements of fairness will be met
by public access to the material available to the decision-maker”. The present
case, he submitted, was not exceptional in that sense, either in principle or
on its own facts.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view <i>Oakley </i>was rightly decided, and consistent with the
general law as established by the House of Lords in <i>Doody</i>. Although
planning law is a creature of statute, the proper interpretation of the statute
is underpinned by general principles, properly referred to as derived from the
common law. <i>Doody </i>itself involved such an application of the common law
principle of “fairness” in a statutory context, in which the giving of reasons
was seen as essential to allow effective supervision by the courts. Fairness
provided the link between the common law duty to give reasons for an
administrative decision, and the right of the individual affected to bring
proceedings to challenge the legality of that decision.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Doody </i>concerned fairness as between the state and an individual
citizen. The same principle is relevant also to planning decisions, the
legality of which may be of legitimate interest to a much wider range of
parties, private and public (see <i>Walton v Scottish Ministers</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/44.html">[2012] UKSC 44</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/44.html">[2013] PTSR 51</a>, paras 152-153 per Lord Hope). Here a further common law
principle is in play. Lord Bridge saw the statutory duty to give reasons as the
analogue of the common law principle that “justice should not only be done, but
also be seen to be done” (see para 25 above). That principle of open justice or
transparency extends as much to statutory inquiries and procedures as it does
to the courts (see <i>Kennedy v The Charity Commission</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/20.html">[2014] UKSC 20</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/20.html">[2015] AC 455</a>, para 47 per Lord Mance, para 127 per Lord Toulson). As applied
to the environment it also underpins the Aarhus Convention, and the relevant
parts of the EA Directive. In this respect the common law, and European law and
practice, march together (compare <a name="_Hlk496707751"><i>Kennedy </i></a>para
46 per Lord Mance). In the application of the principle to planning decisions,
I see no reason to distinguish between a Ministerial inquiry, and the less
formal, but equally public, decision-making process of a local planning
authority such as in this case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The existence of a common law duty to disclose the reasons for a
decision, supplementing the statutory rules, is not inconsistent with the
abrogation in 2013 of the specific duty imposed by the former rules to give
reasons for the grant of permission. As the explanatory memorandum made clear,
that was not intended to detract from the general principle of transparency
(which was affirmed), but was a practical acknowledgement of the different ways
in which that objective could normally be attained without adding unnecessarily
to the administrative burden. In circumstances where the objective is not
achieved by other means, there should be no objection to the common law filling
the gap.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus in <i>Oakley </i>the Court of Appeal were entitled in my view to
hold that, in the special circumstances of that case, openness and fairness to
objectors required the members’ reasons to be stated. Such circumstances were
found in the widespread public controversy surrounding the proposal, and the
departure from development plan and Green Belt policies; combined with the
members’ disagreement with the officers’ recommendation, which made it
impossible to infer the reasons from their report or other material available
to the public. The same combination is found in the present case, and, in my
view, would if necessary have justified the imposition of a common law duty to
provide reasons for the decision.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This endorsement of the Court of Appeal’s approach may be open to the
criticism that it leaves some uncertainty about what particular factors are
sufficient to trigger the common law duty, and indeed as to the justification
for limiting the duty at all (see the perceptive analysis by Dr Joanna Bell: <i>Kent
and Oakley: A Re-examination of the Common Law Duty to Give Reasons for Grants
of Planning Permission and Beyond </i>(2017) 22 Judicial Review 105-113). The
answer to the latter must lie in the relationship of the common law and the
statutory framework. The court should respect the exercise of Ministerial
discretion, in designating certain categories of decision for a formal
statement of reasons. But it may also take account of the fact that the present
system of rules has developed piecemeal and without any apparent pretence of
overall coherence. It is appropriate for the common law to fill the gaps, but
to limit that intervention to circumstances where the legal policy reasons are
particularly strong.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the charge of uncertainty, it would be wrong to be over-prescriptive,
in a judgment on a single case and a single set of policies. However it should
not be difficult for councils and their officers to identify cases which call
for a formulated statement of reasons, beyond the statutory requirements.
Typically they will be cases where, as in <i>Oakley </i>and the present case,
permission has been granted in the face of substantial public opposition and
against the advice of officers, for projects which involve major departures
from the development plan, or from other policies of recognised importance
(such as the “specific policies” identified in the NPPF - para 22 above). Such
decisions call for public explanation, not just because of their immediate
impact; but also because, as Lord Bridge pointed out (para 45 above), they are
likely to have lasting relevance for the application of policy in future cases.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, with regard to Sales LJ’s concerns about the burden on members,
it is important to recognise that the debate is not about the necessity for a
planning authority to make its decision on rational grounds, but about when it
is required to disclose the reasons for those decisions, going beyond the
documentation that already exists as part of the decision-making process.
Members are of course entitled to depart from their officers’ recommendation
for good reasons, but their reasons for doing so need to be capable of
articulation, and open to public scrutiny. There is nothing novel or unduly
burdensome about this. The Lawyers in Local Government Model Council Planning Code
and Protocol (2013 update) gives the following useful advice, under the heading
“Decision-making”:</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Do make sure that if you are
proposing, seconding or supporting a decision contrary to officer
recommendations or the development plan that you clearly identify and
understand the <u>planning reasons</u> leading to this conclusion / decision.
These reasons must be given prior to the vote and be recorded. Be aware that
you may have to justify the resulting decision by giving evidence in the event
of any challenge.” (their emphasis)</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The decision in this case</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The members of the Dover planning committee on 13 June 2013 had an
unenviable task. The meeting started at six in the evening, probably for most
of them at the end of a hard-working day. They were faced with probably the
most significant planning application for their area for many years. It was no
doubt seen as the culmination of an extended process of formal and informal
consultation, triggered by the submission of the application over a year
before, and they may have felt under some pressure to reach a conclusion. The
officers’ report, admirable though it was, had arrived on their desks only a
few days before the meeting. Not only was it long and detailed in itself, but
it introduced into the debate a new element of potentially critical
significance (the proposed reduction in the number of houses), on which there
was a sharp difference of view between the expert advisers.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Model Council Planning Code and Protocol, already referred to (para
60 above) contains under the same heading the following advice:</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Do come to your decision only
after due consideration of all of the information reasonably required upon
which to base a decision. If you feel there is insufficient time to digest new
information or that there is simply insufficient information before you,
request that further information. If necessary, defer or refuse.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para62">This passage not only offers sound practical advice. It
also reflects the important legal principle that a decision-maker must not only
ask himself the right question, but “take reasonable steps to acquaint himself
with the relevant information to enable him to answer it correctly” (<i>Secretary
of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1976/6.html">[1977] AC 1014</a>, 1065B). That obligation, which applies to a planning committee as much
as to the Secretary of State, includes the need to allow the time reasonably
necessary, not only to obtain the relevant information, but also to understand
and take it properly into account.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if there was pressure for a decision on the principle of the
development, it seems unfortunate that the members did not apparently consider
deferring detailed discussion of the officer’s proposed modifications,
including the contentious issue of viability. It is difficult to see how the
members could have expected to reach a properly considered decision on the
material then before them. With hindsight at least, given that the application
did not come back to the committee for more than a year, nothing would have
been lost.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue of timing is not directly relevant to the reasons challenge
before us, but it is an important part of the background. It is not in dispute
that the Council was in breach of a specific requirement under the EIA
regulations to make available a statement of “the main reasons and
considerations” on which the decision was based. The only issue is the nature
of the remedy. Mr Cameron submits that a declaration is sufficient and that the
reasons can be supplied retrospectively. In so far as this submission is
specific to the EIA duty, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Richardson</i>,
I cannot accept it for the reasons already given. The report of <i>Oakley </i>does
not indicate what order resulted in that case. In the present case, however, I
am satisfied that that is not an appropriate or sufficient remedy. Indeed it is
notable that in the three years since the permission was issued, no attempt has
been made to formulate the reasons so as to make good the admitted breach. This
perhaps underlines the difficulty of reconstructing the operative reasons of
the committee on the basis simply of what is in the minutes.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Cameron relies on the views attributed to the three members who were
recorded as supporting the proposal. That was against the background that the
officers had recommended approval for a departure from the AONB policies, for
reasons they had explained, and which the committee can be taken to have
accepted. The only substantial difference was as to whether a reduced dwelling
limit should be imposed. That was seen by the committee as turning on whether
the risk to the viability of the scheme outweighed the harm to the AONB. That
issue, he submits, was fully debated and the majority’s conclusion and
reasoning were clearly reflected in the minutes. The restrictions proposed by
the officers were not accepted because (in the words there recorded) -</a></p><a name="para65">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… this could jeopardise the
viability of the scheme, deter other developments and be less effective in
delivering the economic benefits.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This submission rests on the uncertain assumption that the views of the
three members quoted were shared by the majority. The required statement under
the regulations is of the reasoning of the committee as a whole. Even making
that assumption, there are serious gaps. There is no indication of how or why
the members felt able, without further investigation, to reject the view of
their own advisers that the viability of the scheme need not be threatened, and
indeed could be enhanced. It was not enough to rely on the possibility of the
scheme being jeopardised, simply on the say-so of the applicant’s advisers
without any reference to the expert view to the contrary. Another important
issue was the officers’ insistence on the need for implementation as “a single
comprehensive scheme” to secure the economic benefits, including in particular
the hotel and conference centre, and for conditions or planning obligations to
achieve that. Given that the members apparently shared their officers’ view of
the importance of those benefits, their omission of any legal mechanism to
secure it needed explanation.</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, as Laws LJ pointed out, the economic argument was only one
side of the picture. The other was the members’ view of the harm to the AONB.
Assuming that they accepted their officers’ view as to the seriousness of the
potential damage to the AONB, it became critical to understand the basis of
their belief that it could be “minimised” by “effective screening”. This was of
particular significance in the context of the EIA regulations which require the
statement to include a description of “the main measures to avoid, reduce and,
if possible, offset the major adverse effects of the development”. If the
committee had reason to think that landscaping measures could reduce or offset
the harm, they needed to be described. At the very least there needed to be an
explanation of how the members reconciled this assertion with the view of their
officers that landscaping would be “largely ineffective”. This point was left
without any explanation.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These points were not merely incidental, but were fundamental to the
officers’ support for the amended scheme. The committee’s failure to address
such points raises a “substantial doubt” (in Lord Brown’s words) as to whether they
had properly understood the key issues or reached “a rational conclusion on
them on relevant grounds”. This is a case where the defect in reasons goes to
the heart of the justification for the permission, and undermines its validity.
The only appropriate remedy is to quash the permission.</a></p><a name="para68">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

the order of the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para69">
