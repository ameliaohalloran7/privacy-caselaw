</span>On 9 November 2016, this Court handed down judgment in the series of
cases collectively reported as <i>R (Carmichael) v Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/58.html">[2016] UKSC 58</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/58.html">[2016] 1 WLR 4550</a> (“<i>Carmichael (SC)</i>”).
This was a judicial review of the regulations governing the removal of the
spare room subsidy, otherwise known as the “bedroom tax”. Regulation B13 of the
Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (first introduced in 2013) required a
percentage reduction in the eligible rent for social sector housing if the
number of bedrooms in the property exceeded the number defined by regulation
B13(5) and (6) as appropriate for the size of the household living there. This
Court held that where there was “a transparent medical need for an additional
bedroom” not catered for in regulation B13(5) and (6) there was unjustified
discrimination on the ground of disability and thus a violation of the
claimant’s rights under article 14 read with article 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights. Mrs Carmichael could not share a bedroom with her
husband because of her disabilities, but whereas the regulation catered for
children who could not share a bedroom for that reason, it did not cater for a
couple who could not do so. Mr and Mrs Rutherford cared for their grandson who
needed an overnight carer because of his disabilities, but whereas the
regulation catered for adults who needed an overnight carer, it did not cater
for children who did so. In both cases, the relief granted was a declaration
that the claimant had suffered discrimination contrary to article 14 of the
Convention: see <i>Carmichael (SC)</i> above and <i>R (Rutherford) v Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/29.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 29</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/29.html">[2016] HLR 8</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 2 March 2017, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions laid
before Parliament the Housing Benefit and Universal Credit (Size Criteria)
(Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/213) which were intended
to cater for the two instances in which this Court had held that the previous
version of regulation B13(5) and (6) led to violations of a Convention right.
They came into effect on 1 April 2017 and were not retrospective.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>The principal issue in this case is the effect of this Court’s decision
in <i>Carmichael (SC)</i> upon the decision-makers in the housing benefit
system - the local authorities, responsible for the payment of housing benefit,
and the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) and the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) hearing
appeals from local authority decisions - in claims relating to periods before
the regulations were amended. Do they have to carry on applying the regulation
in its original form? Or do they have to calculate housing benefit without
making the percentage deduction in cases where to do so will breach the
Convention rights of the claimants in the way determined in the <i>Carmichael</i>
and <i>Rutherford</i> cases? This is an important constitutional question.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>A secondary issue is whether, if the housing benefit is to be calculated
without the percentage deduction in such cases, account should be taken of any
discretionary housing payments (“DHPs”) received by the claimant during the
period in question.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant, RR, lives with his severely disabled partner in a two-bedroomed
rented social housing property for which he claims housing benefit. The
respondent local authority, Sefton Borough Council, applied regulation B13 and
decided that, because they were a couple, they were only entitled to one
bedroom and so applied the 14% discount required by regulation B13(3)(a) with
effect from 1 April 2013. RR appealed to the FTT. On 15 August 2014, the FTT
found as a fact that RR and his partner required separate bedrooms because of
her disabilities and her need to accommodate medical equipment and supplies.
Sefton accepted that, as her primary carer, RR needed to be able to get a
night’s sleep. The FTT further held that RR had suffered discrimination as
between a member of a couple with a disability and a member of a couple without
disability which could not be objectively and reasonably justified. To avoid
this discrimination, the FTT held, applying the interpretative obligation in
section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the HRA”), that regulation
B13(5)(a) should be read so as to apply either to a couple or to one member of

</span>Meanwhile, in parallel to the judicial review proceedings which
culminated in this Court’s decision in <i>Carmichael (SC)</i>, Mr Carmichael
had appealed to the FTT against the local authority’s decision that his housing
benefit entitlement should be reduced by 14%. The FTT allowed his appeal on a
similar basis to that on which it had allowed the appeal of RR. The Secretary
of State’s appeals against both decisions were stayed until the outcome of <i>Carmichael
(SC) </i>was known. Both stays were lifted in January 2017.</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>Mr Carmichael’s appeal was determined by the UT in April 2017: <i>Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions v Carmichael</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2017/174.html">[2017] UKUT 174 (AAC)</a> (“<i>Carmichael
(UT)</i>”). The UT held that the FTT’s reading of regulation B13(5)(a) was
impermissible but nevertheless reached the same result by holding that Mr
Carmichael’s housing benefit was to be calculated without making the 14%
deduction because to make it would be a clear breach of his Convention rights,
contrary to section 6(1) of the HRA.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State appealed the <i>Carmichael</i> <i>(UT)</i>
decision to the Court of Appeal and that Court stayed the appeal in <i>RR </i>and
some 130 other cases (referred to as the “Carmichael/Rutherford lookalike
cases”) pending the outcome of that appeal. The Court of Appeal gave judgment
on 20 March 2018: <i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Carmichael </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/548.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 548</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/548.html">[2018] 1 WLR 3429</a> (“<i>Carmichael (CA)</i>”). The appeal was
allowed. The majority (Sir Brian Leveson PQBD and Flaux LJ) held that the UT
did not have power to direct as it did, as this would amount to an
impermissible rewording of the regulation: any remedy for the violation of
Convention rights was to be found in an action for damages under section 8(2)
of the HRA. Leggatt LJ dissented: he would have held that the UT did have power
to do what it did. However, he also held that the UT had erred in not taking
into account the DHPs that Mr Carmichael had received. So the Court was
unanimous in allowing the Secretary of State’s appeal. Mr Carmichael has not
appealed to this Court. Nevertheless, this case is effectively a challenge to
that decision.</p>

</span>The stay on the Secretary of State’s appeal to the UT in the case of <i>RR
</i>(and another) was lifted on 4 May 2018. RR accepted that the UT was bound
by <i>Carmichael (CA) </i>to allow the appeal, which by a decision dated 28
August 2018, it duly did: <i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v RR and
Sefton Borough Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/AAC/2018/355.html">[2018] UKUT 355 (AAC)</a>. The UT also commented that it
seemed “eminently arguable” the problem of double payment, identified by
Leggatt LJ, could be overcome by reason of regulation 8(2)(b) of the
Discretionary Financial Assistance Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/1167).</p>

B13 read as follows:</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>The first amendment (made by SI 2013/665), which came into force on the
same day that the regulation came into force, 1 April 2013, repealed the tailpiece
to paragraph (5) and incorporated it in a new paragraph (6) as follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para12">A “person who requires overnight care” was defined in
regulation 2(1) in terms which had the effect of not including any child. The
inclusion of claimants or their partners who required overnight care in the
original and amended regulation was as a result of the decision of the Court of
Appeal in <i>Burnip v Birmingham City Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 629</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>.</p>

</span>The next amendment (made by SI 2013/2828 in December 2013) added to the
list in paragraph (5):</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(ba)&nbsp;&nbsp; a child who cannot share a

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This was as a result of the decision of the Court of
Appeal in <i>Gorry v Wiltshire County Council</i>, decided at the same time as <i>Burnip</i>
and reported with it. The category of adults whose disabilities might count for
the purpose of paragraph (6) was also expanded to include people responsible
for the rent and their partners.</p>

</span>Thus it will be seen that, by the time of <i>Carmichael (SC)</i>,<i> </i>the
regulation catered for children who could not share a bedroom but not for
members of a couple who could not do so. It also catered for adults who needed
overnight care but not for children who needed it. It was in those two respects
that the regulation was held discriminatory by this Court and the third
amendment (made by SI 2017/213) was designed to cure them. As the effect of
those amendments is not in issue in this appeal, and their wording is by no
means crystal clear, there is no need to prolong this judgment by quoting them.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="ParaHeading">The arguments on the principal issue</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Richard Drabble QC, who appears for the appellant, does not argue
that regulation B13 is ultra vires. Rather, he argues that it is unlawful for
the local authority, the FTT and the UT to apply the deduction mandated by
regulation B13(2)(b) and (3) in breach of the appellant’s Convention rights.
Under section 6(1) of the HRA, “It is unlawful for a public authority to act in
a way which is incompatible with a Convention right”. A local authority is
undoubtedly a public authority for this purpose. Further, by virtue of section
6(3)(a), a “public authority” includes a court or tribunal. It is therefore
unlawful for a local authority, the FTT, the UT, or indeed the Court of Appeal
or this Court, to make or uphold an award which is incompatible with the
claimant’s Convention rights.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This would not be the case if the decision were mandated by primary
legislation. Section 6(2)(a) of the HRA provides that subsection (1) does not
apply to an act if “as the result of one or more provisions of primary
legislation, the authority could not have acted differently”. But the
regulation is not primary legislation. Nor does primary legislation require
that the regulation take the form that it does: it has subsequently been
amended with a view to curing the incompatibility found in <i>Carmichael (SC)</i>.
Thus section 6(2)(b) is also inapplicable. This provides that subsection (1)
does not apply to an act if “in the case of one or more provisions of, or made
under, primary legislation which cannot be read and given effect in a way which
is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to
give effect to or enforce those provisions”. The regulation is not primary
legislation and, although made under primary legislation, the enabling Act does
not mandate a regulation which, in some respects, was incompatible with a
Convention right.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under section 7(1)(b) of the HRA, “A person who claims that a public
authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by
section 6(1), may rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal
proceedings”. Hence the appellant did not have to bring separate, free-standing
proceedings to claim a remedy for a breach of his Convention rights. He could
rely on it in the tribunal proceedings. The authority, and the tribunals,
should have made an award of housing benefit without the 14% reduction which,
in the light of the FTT’s findings of fact, was incompatible with the
appellant’s Convention rights.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>Mr Drabble is able to pray in aid at least two decisions at the level of
this Court which support that analysis. Closest to it is <i>Mathieson v
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/47.html">[2015] UKSC 47</a>;<i> </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/47.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3250</a>. The regulations governing entitlement to disability living allowance (“DLA”)
suspended the entitlement of a child under 16 after the first 84 days of free
in-patient treatment in an NHS hospital. This Court held that, in the
circumstances of that case, to suspend entitlement was a violation of the
child’s Convention rights under article 14 read with article 1 of the First
Protocol. The Secretary of State was not obliged by any provision of primary
legislation to suspend payment; thus he had acted unlawfully under section 6(1)
of the HRA in deciding to do so. The FTT should have allowed the child’s appeal
against that decision and substituted a decision that he was entitled to
continued payment of DLA from the date when it was suspended until the date
when it was reinstated. This Court allowed the child’s appeal and made the
order which the FTT should have made.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, the Court declined to make a declaration that the
Secretary of State had violated the child’s rights. In a statutory appeal such
as this, the FTT, UT and Court of Appeal had no power to make a formal
declaration: see sections 12(4) and 14(4) of the Tribunals, Courts and
Enforcement Act 2007. Even if the powers of this Court were wider, to make a
declaration would add nothing to the substantive order made by the Court.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court also declined to use the interpretative obligation in section
3(1) of the HRA, to read the regulations relating to suspension so as not to
apply to children. Section 3(1) requires that “So far as it is possible to do
so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given
effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights”. Lord Wilson
did not think that possible in that case. But in any event, the 84-day rule
would not always or inevitably be in breach of a child’s Convention rights:
much would depend upon the circumstances of the individual case.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <i>Mathieson</i> approach had previously been applied in a number of
other benefit cases. In <i>Francis v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1303.html">[2005] EWCA Civ 1303</a>;<i> </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1303.html">[2006] 1 WLR 3202</a>, the regulations governing entitlement
to a maternity grant were held incompatible with the Convention rights of a
woman who had obtained a residence order giving her parental responsibility for
her sister’s baby son, because they treated the holder of a residence order less
favourably that the holder of an adoption order. The remedy was not to construe
the regulations in her favour but to make a declaration that she was entitled
to the maternity grant. In <i>Burnip v Birmingham City Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 629</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/629.html">[2013] PTSR 117</a>, mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal remitted each
case where a violation had been found to the local authority for the decision
to be remade in accordance with the Court of Appeal’s judgment. Each claimant
was entitled to such further sum as was necessary to comply with the judgment
and article 14. As Leggatt LJ explained in <i>Carmichael (CA)</i>, at para 94,
“Thus, the Court of Appeal treated the Housing Benefit Regulations as having no
effect in the three individual cases before them insofar as applying the
Regulations in calculating the claimants’ entitlement to housing benefit
violated their Convention rights by treating them as under-occupying their
accommodation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A further example of the application of the same approach, albeit in a
rather different context, is the decision of the House of Lords in <i>In re G
(Adoption: Unmarried Couple) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2008] UKHL 38</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2009] AC 173</a>. Article 14 of
the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (SI 1987/2203) provided that an
adoption order could only be made in favour of more than one person if they
were married to one another. The House of Lords held that this discrimination
between married and unmarried couples was irrational and in breach of article
14 read with article 8 of the Convention. The remedy was a declaration that
this particular couple were entitled to apply to adopt the child. Had the Order
been primary legislation, the courts would have been bound to give effect to
it: the most they would have done was to make a declaration of incompatibility
under section 4 of the HRA. But, at para 116, it was explained that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The courts are free simply to
disregard subordinate legislation which cannot be interpreted or given effect
in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. Indeed, in my view,
this cannot be a matter of discretion. Section 6(1) requires the court to act
compatibly with the Convention rights if it is free to do so.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A more recent example of the same approach is <i>JT v First-tier
Tribunal </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1735.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 1735</a>;<i> </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1735.html">[2019] 1 WLR 1313</a>. This concerned a
rule in the criminal injuries compensation scheme which barred victims who had
suffered injury before 1979 from making a claim if at the time of the injury
they were living under the same roof as the perpetrator. The Court of Appeal
held that this was incompatible with article 14 read with article 1 of the First
Protocol and granted a declaration that the claimant was not prevented by the
rule from being paid an award of compensation under the scheme. As Leggatt LJ
explained, at para 122:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where, as here, a provision of
subordinate legislation cannot be given effect in a way which is compatible
with a Convention right and there is no primary legislation which prevents
removal of the incompatibility, the court’s duty under section 6(1) is to treat
the provision as having no effect, as to give effect to it would be unlawful.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against that, Sir James Eadie QC, for the Secretary of State, accepts
that the regulation was incompatible in the respects identified in <i>Carmichael
(SC)</i>, and that it could not be interpreted under section 3(1) of the HRA in
a way which avoided that incompatibility. No-one sought to defend the FTT’s
rewriting of the regulation so as to add words in. It was the size criteria
rather than the 14% deduction which gave rise to the incompatibility. Rectifying
that would require rewriting the regulation, which could be done in a variety
of ways. It was not for the local authority or the tribunals to redesign the
legislative scheme so as to render it compatible with the Convention rights.
That would be constitutionally inappropriate, usurping the role of the
legislator. It was also outside their statutory powers.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He did not accept that <i>Mathieson </i>represented a consistent line of
authority that incompatible provisions in subordinate legislation could simply
be ignored. It was a case in which a specific finding was made that could be
dealt with as an individual case, not a structural problem as in this case. The
court declined to go further and did not address the constitutional problems of
what it had done.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, he argues that to allow the tribunals to disapply the
regulation would be to cut across the provisions of the HRA relating to
damages. Section 8(1) of the HRA provides that “In relation to any act (or
proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be)
unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its
powers as it considers just and appropriate”. Section 8(2) provides that
“damages may be awarded only by a court which has power to award damages, or to
order payment of compensation, in civil proceedings”. Making an award of
housing benefit without the deduction would be tantamount to making an award of
damages or compensation which the tribunals have no power to do. Thus, if there
has been a violation of the Convention rights, the correct remedy is a
free-standing application, under section 7(1)(a) of the HRA, to a court which
does have power to award damages.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span>Although the majority of the Court of Appeal in <i>Carmichael (CA)</i> accepted
the arguments of the Secretary of State, in my view Leggatt LJ was entirely
right to accept the arguments of the appellant. There is nothing
unconstitutional about a public authority, court or tribunal disapplying a
provision of subordinate legislation which would otherwise result in their
acting incompatibly with a Convention right, where this is necessary in order
to comply with the HRA. Subordinate legislation is subordinate to the
requirements of an Act of Parliament. The HRA is an Act of Parliament and its
requirements are clear.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The HRA draws a clear and careful distinction between primary and
subordinate legislation. This is shown, not only by the provisions of section
6(1) and 6(2) which have already been referred to, but also by the provisions
of section 3(2). This provides that the interpretative obligation in section
3(1):</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applies to primary and
subordinate legislation whenever enacted;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not affect the
validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible primary
legislation; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not affect the
validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible subordinate
legislation if (disregarding any possibility of revocation) primary legislation
prevents the removal of the incompatibility.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Once again, a clear distinction is drawn between primary
and subordinate legislation.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The obligation in section 6(1), not to act in a way which is
incompatible with a Convention right, is subject to the exception in section
6(2). But this only applies to acts which are required by primary legislation.
If it had been intended to disapply the obligation in section 6(1) to acts
which are required by subordinate legislation, the HRA would have said so.
Again, under section 3(2), primary legislation which cannot be read or given
effect compatibly with the Convention rights must still be given effect, as
must subordinate legislation if primary legislation prevents removal of the
incompatibility. If it had been intended that the section would not affect the
validity, continuing operation or enforcement of incurably incompatible
subordinate legislation, where there was no primary legislation preventing
removal of the incompatibility, the HRA would have said so.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the Secretary of State’s argument, <i>Mathieson </i>was not
a “one off”. As shown by the authorities listed in paras 21 to 23 above, the
courts have consistently held that, where it is possible to do so, a provision
of subordinate legislation which results in a breach of a Convention right must
be disregarded. There may be cases where it is not possible to do so, because
it is not clear how the statutory scheme can be applied without the offending
provision. But that was not the case in <i>Francis</i>, where the maternity
grant could be paid to the holder of a residence order who qualified for it in
all other respects; nor was it the case in<i> In re G</i>, where the unmarried
couple could be allowed to apply to adopt (in reaching my Opinion, I satisfied
myself that this would not cause problems elsewhere in the statutory scheme);
nor was it the case in <i>Burnip </i>and <i>Gorry</i>, where housing benefit
could simply be calculated without making the deduction for under-occupation;
nor was it the case in <i>Mathieson</i>, where DLA could simply continue to be
paid during the whole period of hospitalisation; nor was it the case in <i>JT</i>,
where criminal injuries compensation could be paid without regard to the “same
roof” rule; and nor is it the case here, where the situation is on all fours
with <i>Burnip </i>and <i>Gorry</i>. There is no legislative choice to be exercised.
As Dan Squires QC, for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, put it, where
discrimination has been found, a legislator may choose between levelling up and
levelling down, but a decision-maker can only level up: if claimant A is
entitled to housing benefit of £X and claimant B is only entitled to housing
benefit of £X-Y, and the difference in treatment is unjustifiably
discriminatory, the decision-maker must find that claimant B is also entitled
to benefit of £X.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State did suggest that the incompatibility could not be
cured in the same way for houses rented in the private sector, because the
amount of housing benefit is calculated in a different way under regulation
13D, although the same size criteria are applied. That situation is not before
us and we have not heard proper argument upon it, but I would be surprised if
an equivalent calculation could not be made, so as to place <i>Carmichael </i>and
<i>Rutherford </i>type claimants in the same position as <i>Burnip </i>and <i>Gorry
</i>type claimants.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As that great judge, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, put it in <i>Attorney
General’s Reference (No 2 of 2001)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/68.html">[2003] UKHL 68</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/68.html">[2004] 2 AC 72</a>, 92, “I
cannot accept that it can ever be proper for a court, whose purpose is to
uphold, vindicate and apply the law, to act in a manner which a statute (here,
section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998) declares to be unlawful”.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The secondary issue</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question of whether any DHPs received by the appellant should be
deducted from the housing benefit to which he is entitled as a result of this
decision can be dealt with shortly, as the parties are agreed as to the
position. The initial decision which is under appeal to this Court was made by
the local authority on 5 March 2013, applying the size criteria which were to
come into force on 1 April 2013. At that stage no question of DHPs could have
arisen. The appeal against that decision was heard a year later. The task of
the FTT was to decide whether the local authority’s decision was correct. As a
Tribunal of Social Security Commissioners, presided over by His Honour Judge
Hickinbottom put it in <i>R (IB) 2/04</i> (unreported) 21 January 2004, at para
25:</a></p><a name="para33">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Taking the simple case of an
appeal against a decision on an initial claim, in<b> </b>our view the appeal
tribunal has power to consider any issue and make any decision on the claim
which the decision-maker could have considered and made. The appeal tribunal in
effect stands in the shoes of the decision-maker for the purpose of making a
decision on the claim.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In deciding a housing benefit appeal, the FTT is not
permitted to take into account any circumstances not obtaining at the time when
the decision appealed against was made: Child Support, Pensions and Social
Security Act 2000, Schedule 7, paragraph 6(9). The task of the UT was the same.
In remaking the decision having set aside the decision of the FTT, it has power
to make any decision which the FTT could make if the FTT were remaking the
decision: Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, section 12(4).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus, neither the initial decision-maker in the local authority, nor the
FTT on appeal, nor the UT on appeal, was concerned with anything other than
entitlement to housing benefit. They were not concerned with DHPs and had no
power to take them into account. Indeed, the Secretary of State relied upon
this fact to bolster the argument that an award of damages under section 8 of
the HRA was a more appropriate remedy than applying section 6, because such an
award could take DHPs into account. But we are concerned with whether the
initial decision was correct and in my view it was not. It is for the local
authority to consider whether there are any steps which they can take to
recover any DHPs and if there are whether they wish to take them.</a></p><a name="para34">

<p class="ParaHeading">Final conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would allow this appeal. I would make the same order as the UT made in
<i>Carmichael (UT) </i>that (1) the appeal against the local authority’s
decision of 5 March 2013 is allowed; and (2) that RR’s housing benefit
entitlement is to be recalculated without making the under-occupancy deduction
of 14%. The reason for doing so is the same as that which the UT gave: “if the tribunal
or the council were to apply this deduction there would be a clear breach of
[RR’s] Convention rights, contrary to section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998
(<i>R (Carmichael) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/58.html">[2016] UKSC 58</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/58.html">[2016] 1 WLR 4550</a>).”</p>
