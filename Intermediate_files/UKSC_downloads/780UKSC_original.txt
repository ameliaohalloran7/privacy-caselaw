He entered the UK illegally on his own and claimed asylum here as an unaccompanied child. There are significant differences in the legal regime applicable to an asylum seeker depending on whether he is a child aged less than 18 or an adult aged 18 or over. In particular, the rules applicable in respect of detention with a view to possible removal are different.</p>

Despite claiming to be a child aged 16, the respondent was assessed by immigration officers at the outset to be an adult and was treated accordingly. Later, when time permitted, more detailed age assessments (so-called <i>Merton</i> assessments: see <i>R (B) v Merton London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/1689.html">[2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/1689.html">[2003] 4 All ER 280</a>) were carried out and it was eventually decided that he was in fact aged less than 18.</p>

Various criteria are set out, of which the following (known as criterion C) is the relevant one:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Their physical appearance/demeanour very strongly suggests that they are <i>significantly</i> over 18 years of age and no other credible evidence exists to the contrary.” (Emphasis in original)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Criterion C applies where there is no other evidence of age available.</p>

The ground which is relevant on this appeal is that criterion C is said to be unlawful because when it is followed it does not remove the possibility that an asylum seeker who claims to be a child may in fact be one, even though he looks older, with the result that he may be subject to treatment which is unlawful in relation to a child.</p> 
</a><a name="para6">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BF’s claim was heard in the Upper Tribunal (Judge Storey), which dismissed it. However, his appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State was obliged to formulate her policy in respect of cases where no evidence of age other than appearance and demeanour is available in such a way that removed the risk that a child might be treated as an adult and detained accordingly, and indicated that the risk of mis-classification of an asylum seeker as an adult would only be removed in a satisfactory way if immigration officers were directed to assess a claimant to be aged 18 or more if they thought he looked about 23 (or possibly 25) or more. The Secretary of State amended criterion C in line with the court’s judgment but has also appealed to this court to contend that the decision of the Court of Appeal was wrong.</p>

He told them he had arrived in the UK earlier that day in the back of a lorry. He said his date of birth was 15 February 1998, in which case he would have been aged 16. The respondent said that he wanted to claim asylum. He had no passport or other papers. He was arrested as an illegal immigrant and served with relevant documentation.</p>

Applying criterion C, both officers assessed him to be significantly over 18. The chief immigration officer’s assessment was that his appearance was that of an adult in his mid-20s. BF was served with a form setting out the officers’ decision that he was an adult. His fingerprints were taken and his identity was checked. The checks revealed that he had been apprehended in Italy in June 2013 and had claimed asylum there.</p>

In April 2014 Italy confirmed its acceptance of the UK’s request that the respondent be returned there and indicated that his date of birth had been recorded as 15 February 1988, which would have made him aged 26 when he arrived in the UK. In response to inquiries, the Italian authorities stated that this date of birth was based on the respondent’s own statement.</p>

In both he was assessed to be an adult. Accordingly, Newport did not accept his claim that he was a child and refused to provide him with services under the Children Act 1989. BF commenced a further claim to challenge these age assessments on the grounds that they did not properly comply with the <i>Merton</i> principles and this claim was settled on the basis that Newport would commission an independent <i>Merton</i> assessment of his age. The social workers who carried out this third assessment decided that the respondent’s age and date of birth were as claimed by him on arrival in the UK, ie he was a child at that time. After that assessment BF issued a further claim against the Secretary of State for wrongful detention. In those proceedings the Secretary of State has disputed the correctness of that third assessment. For the purposes of the present appeal it is not necessary to say anything more about that claim.</p>

The first, “Individual found to be a child”, spelt out the consequence of such a finding (where the limited provisions authorising detention of a child did not apply), namely that the child “must not be detained or must be released from detention into the care of a local authority and treated as a child” (and reference was made to a separate asylum instruction about that). The fourth was headed “Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and the assessing age detention policy”. This stated:</a></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The assessing age detention policy has in-built protections to ensure it is compliant with the section 55 duty. The threshold that must be met for individuals to enter or remain in detention following a claim to be a child is a high one and is only met if the benefit of doubt afforded to all individuals prior to any assessment of their age is made is then displaced because the individual has met one or more of the categories listed at the start of section 55.9.3.1.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">As a general principle, even where one of the statutory powers to detain is available in a particular case, unaccompanied children must not be detained other than in the very exceptional circumstances specified in paragraph 18B of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (see Detention - general guidance). Failure to adhere to the legal powers and policy on detaining children can have very significant consequences, for example:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.4pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt; margin-left:126.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">•<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if they believe themselves to be a child, the effect of not being believed by the Home Office and, consequently, being detained, can be very stressful and demoralising.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Age assessments cannot always provide the same degree of confidence about treating an individual as an adult or a child as can be provided by reliable documents. To allow for this, the principle of ‘the benefit of the doubt’ is applied. This means that where there is still uncertainty about whether the individual is an adult or a child, the individual should be treated as a child and referred to a local authority, with a request for a <i>Merton</i> compliant age assessment. This would include cases where their physical appearance and demeanour does not very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The initial age assessment stage for cases where the claimed age is not accepted is intended to lead to a decision on how an individual should be treated and is divided into three possible outcomes with a number of reasons for arriving at them.

<p class="ParaNoNumber">After a description of the three possible outcomes, the guidance continued:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Further to the above brief outcome descriptions, if an asylum seeker or migrants [sic] claimed age is doubted and there is no reliable evidence to support that claim, you must conduct an initial age assessment in accordance with the more detailed guidance in the remainder of the Initial age assessment section.”</p>

It then turns to the question whether the young person’s “physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggests that they are significantly over 18” (criterion C). It reads:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“You must treat the claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour <b>very strongly suggests that they are significantly over 18 years of age</b> [emphasis in original]. You must give careful consideration when assessing whether a claimant falls into this category. Where they do, they will be considered under the adult processes and could, therefore, become liable for detention. Refer to the introduction of the Initial age assessment section for guidance on the significantly adverse consequences of unlawfully detaining children, on both the child themselves and the Home Office.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">If your assessment determines that the claimant's physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggests that they are significantly over 18, you must refer the case to another officer to act as a ‘second pair of eyes’.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The second officer must be at least either a:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The second officer must make their own independent assessment of the claimant’s age. Their assessment must be:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The age a person must exceed, to be regarded as significantly over 18, is not specified within this guidance document. This is consistent with the Upper Tribunal’s judgment [in the present case] which found that:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.4pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt; margin-left:108.0pt">‘… since the objective of the policy is to identify by way of initial “screening” assessment cases that are outside the category of “borderline cases” it is not apparent that there would be any value in greater precision than such an assessment can deliver’.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">There follow passages giving guidance on “Assessing physical appearance” and “Assessing demeanour” which have no counterpart in version 1. It is not necessary to reproduce them here. The section ends with a passage headed “The decision”, which states:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As shown in Assessing physical appearance and Assessing demeanour, although levels of maturity can be assessed, maturity is not an accurate reflection of chronological age and maturity itself can be variable. You must also keep in mind that young people may deliberately attempt to present as younger or older than their age.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The policy is specifically designed to allow a large margin of error in favour of the claimant’s claim to be a child. It achieves this by requiring Home Office staff to only treat them as an adult on the basis of their physical appearance and demeanour, where they conclude that these indicators very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age. This takes account of the challenges in assessing a claimant’s age in such circumstances.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Although each claimant’s circumstances are unique, when making decisions on age based on the claimant’s physical appearance and demeanour, you should utilise your experience of working with asylum seeking children and young people, particularly those:</p>

The Upper Tribunal rejected this submission on the basis that there was nothing in the guidance that suggests that immigration officers are permitted or encouraged to undertake unlawful acts: “[t]he policy does not assert that minors are to be detained contrary to any statutory provisions … the safeguards set out in the policy are surely designed to ensure that unlawful acts are avoided so far as is consistent with objective knowledge at the relevant time” (para 59).</p>

His contention was that this could be established in two ways: (i) it was clear from looking at the policy itself, and (ii) it was clear from an examination of empirical data about how the policy guidance operated in practice. The Upper Tribunal held that point (i) was essentially the same as the argument based on <i>Gillick</i> and rejected it for the same reasons (para 63). As to (ii), the Upper Tribunal judge analysed witness statements adduced by each side and conducted a review of such statistics as existed in relation to detention of immigrants in cases where there was a dispute regarding their age, reaching this conclusion (para 77): “[g]iven the evidential and methodological difficulties identified in both [sides’] data sets, I do not consider I have a sufficient evidential basis on which to draw any definite conclusions as regards whether there is a significant risk of error, let alone a risk that is systematic.”</p>

The challenge to criterion C was upheld by the court in relation to both these contexts, unanimously in relation to version 1 of the documents and by a majority (Simon LJ dissenting) in relation to version 2. The principal judgment was given by Underhill LJ.</p> 
</a><a name="para37">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underhill LJ referred to the evidence adduced in support of the claim in the Upper Tribunal from various witnesses to the effect that assessment of age on the basis of physical appearance is unreliable. In particular, he referred to a document published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health entitled <i>The Health of Refugee Children - Guidelines for Paediatricians</i>, which had been relied on by Stanley Burnton J in the <i>Merton</i> case and was referred to in <i>Assessing Age</i> (see above), which included this statement:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In practice, age determination is extremely difficult to do with certainty, and no single approach to this is [sic] can be relied on. Moreover, for young people aged 15-18, it is even less possible to be certain about age. There may also be difficulties in determining whether a young person who might be as old as 23 could, in fact, be under the age of 18. Age determination is an inexact science and the margin of error can sometimes be as much as five years either side.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The document explains in detail the difficulties associated with assessment of age, including the absence of any reliable anthropometric measure. A letter of July 2014 from the Registrar of the Royal College of Paediatricians confirmed that the views of the Royal College remained unchanged, that “assessment of age should only be made in the context of a holistic assessment of the child” and that in its view “the guidance to immigration staff that advises visual assessment of age is unsafe and unhelpful”.</p> 
</a><a name="para38">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underhill LJ observed that “[t]he law requires a wholly different treatment of young asylum seekers depending on whether they have passed their 18th birthday” and that, despite the difficulties this involves, “it has to be applied as best can be”. Where there is no objective way of establishing the age of a young asylum seeker, such as by reference to documents (and they may genuinely not know their true date of birth), “even if they do they have an obvious incentive to misrepresent it” (ie to avoid detention and to secure the provision of child services from a local authority), “[t]here are no medical or scientific means for establishing the age of a young person with any precision”. It followed that “[i]n such cases the necessary determination of whether he is over or under 18 will have to be made on the basis of a subjective assessment” (para 52). Although the most reliable means of assessing the age of a young person in the absence of objective evidence is by a <i>Merton</i>-compliant assessment involving experienced social workers, criterion C is concerned with the initial assessment of age by immigration officers who have to decide on first contact what to do with an asylum seeker, and it was common ground that it is not practicable for immigration officers to procure a <i>Merton</i> assessment when deciding whether to detain or not at that stage (para 53). The legal challenge was directed to the lawfulness of criterion C as applied at that initial stage (there being means for an asylum seeker to contest an assessment that he is an adult and not a child reasonably quickly thereafter, including by asking for a <i>Merton</i> assessment) (para 56). As Underhill LJ noted, “[a]ny such initial assessment will be bound in the typical case to depend primarily on what is described in criterion C as ‘physical appearance/demeanour’, assessed by immigration officers on the basis of contact which is far less substantial than in a <i>Merton</i>-compliant assessment. It will be correspondingly more unreliable” (para 54). On the evidence available, the margin of error is substantial and the best estimate appears to be about five years, by reference to the guidance from the Royal College of Paediatricians, though the Upper Tribunal thought it might be as much as seven years (para 54).</p>

Mr Hermer submitted that the guidance in <i>UNISON</i> was to the same effect as the test stated by Lord Mance (with the agreement of the majority of the court) in <i>In re Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission’s Application for Judicial Review</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/27.html">[2018] UKSC 27</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/27.html">[2019] 1 All ER 173</a>, para 82 (“<i>Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission</i>”), and argued that “the key question was whether the Secretary of State’s policy created a real risk that at least some children would be unlawfully detained” (para 60). He also submitted that the approach adopted in <i>R (Refugee Legal Centre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1481.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 1481</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1481.html">[2005] 1 WLR 2219</a> (“<i>Refugee Legal Centre</i>”) was consistent with both those decisions in this court.

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para63">“I do not think that it is necessary or useful to analyse the various cases referred to. In my view the correct approach in the circumstances of the present case is, straightforwardly, that the policy/guidance contained in paragraph 55.3.9.1 of the EIG and the relevant parts of <i>Assessing Age</i> will be unlawful, if but only if, the way that they are framed creates a real risk of a more than minimal number of children being detained. I should emphasise, however, that the policy should not be held to be unlawful only because there are liable, as in any system which necessarily depends on the exercise of subjective judgment, to be particular ‘aberrant’ decisions - that is, individual mistakes or misjudgments made in the pursuit of a proper policy. The issue is whether the terms of the policy themselves create a risk which could be avoided if they were better formulated.</a>”</p> 
<a name="para41">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying that test, Underhill LJ held that criterion C, as it appeared in both versions of the EIG and both versions of <i>Assessing Age</i>, was unlawful, in that the EIG and <i>Assessing Age</i> “contain no recognition of just how unreliable the exercise of assessing age on the basis of appearance and demeanour is and, in consequence, how wide a margin of error is required” (para 65, also paras 67 and 73-75). The guidance should have indicated that the margin of error for an age assessment of a young person was of the order of about five years or more. This defect in the guidance gave rise to a real risk of children being unlawfully detained (para 68). In substance, therefore, Underhill LJ was of the opinion that the guidance should direct immigration officers that, in cases where objective evidence was not available, they could only treat an asylum seeker as an adult for the purposes of deciding to detain him if they believed him to be aged 23 or more. He reached this conclusion without needing to rely on an analysis of statistics placed before the court by both sides, although he noted that there had been numerous cases where an initial assessment that a young person was an adult had subsequently turned out to be wrong and this lent “weight to the probability that some immigration officers have failed to appreciate the width of the margin of error that needs to be applied” (para 69).</p>

Simon LJ agreed with Underhill LJ regarding the test to be applied and with his conclusion that criterion C was unlawful in version 1 of the EIG and version 1 of <i>Assessing Age</i>, in that it created a risk of more than a minimal number of children being detained. However, Simon LJ considered that criterion C was lawful in the context of version 2 of the EIG and version 2 of <i>Assessing Age.</i> In his view the amplified guidance in version 2 of <i>Assessing Age</i> regarding the risks associated with judging age from physical appearance and demeanour alone, the emphasis in criterion C and the guidance generally that it was intended to provide a margin against error in assessing age based on those factors and the fact that two immigration officers of suitable seniority separately had to make the assessment in accordance with those criteria, had the effect that the risk of mis-assessment was sufficiently reduced as to make the guidance in its second version lawful.</p>

Criterion C currently requires immigration officers to base their decision regarding whether an asylum seeker is aged 18 or over on an assessment of whether “their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggests that they are 25 years of age or over”.

As we explain in our judgment in the <i>A</i> case, the meaning of the formula used by Lord Scarman is much narrower than suggested by Mr Hermer. It involves comparing two normative statements, one being the underlying legal position and the other being the direction in the policy guidance, to see if the latter contradicts the former. Mr Hermer’s submission as to the effect of <i>Gillick</i> distorts this test by comparing a normative statement with a factual prediction, ie comparing the underlying legal position with what might happen in fact if the persons to whom the policy guidance is directed are given no further information. If correct, this would involve imposing on the person promulgating the guidance a very different, and far more extensive, obligation than that discussed in <i>Gillick</i>. It would transform the obligation from one not to give a direction which conflicts with the legal duty of the addressee into an obligation to promulgate a policy which removes the risk of possible misapplication of the law on the part of those who are subject to a legal duty. There is no general duty of that kind at common law.</p>

That is inherent in the nature of law, and the remedy is to have access to the courts to compel that person to act in accordance with their duty. An asylum seeker has the same right to apply to the courts as anyone else. Save in specific contexts of a kind discussed below and in our judgment in the <i>A</i> case, there is no obligation for a Minister or anyone else to issue policy guidance in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty in relation to the application of a stipulated legal rule. Any such obligation would be extremely far-reaching and difficult (if not impossible in many cases) to comply with. It would also conflict with fundamental features of the separation of powers. It would require Ministers to take action to amplify and to some degree restate rules laid down in legislation, whereas it is for Parliament to choose the rules which it wishes to have applied. And it would inevitably involve the courts in assessing whether Ministers had done so sufficiently, thereby requiring courts to intervene to an unprecedented degree in the area of legislative choice and to an unprecedented degree in the area of executive decision-making in terms of control of the administrative apparatus through the promulgation of policy.</p>

When the legislation was changed with effect from that date, that became the legal rule laid down in primary legislation. The fact that it may be difficult in marginal cases to tell which category a particular individual falls into does not indicate that there is a problem with the rule itself. The Secretary of State, in the first place, and then Parliament were clearly entitled to state the rule to be applied as they did. In neither case was the Secretary of State under any obligation to correct or qualify the rule by issuing policy guidance.</p>

As was accepted on all sides in the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal and was acknowledged by Underhill LJ (para 55), there are sound policy reasons why adults should be treated as such and not as children:</p> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">“[Counsel for the respondent and for the intervener] [b]oth accepted, as had also been accepted before the tribunal … that there would be cases where it is so obvious, even on an initial assessment of appearance and demeanour, that a person was over 18 that to treat them as a child would be unjustified. That is of course also in line with the observations of Stanley Burnton J in <i>Merton</i> [at para 27]. It must be borne in mind that to treat an adult migrant as a child is itself not a problem-free course. It is a considerable burden on local authorities to have to find appropriate accommodation for [unaccompanied asylum-seeking children], and that resource should not be wasted on those who obviously do not qualify for it. It would bring the system into disrepute with local authorities and their staff and others involved (such as those providing foster care) if people who were obviously adults were accorded treatment and benefits intended for children. It is also of course easier for migrants with no genuine claim for asylum to abscond from a foster home or supported independent accommodation than from immigration detention.</a>”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Although a local authority, when deciding whether its obligations under the Children Act 1989 to provide child services are engaged, is not obliged to accept the assessment of immigration officers that a person is a child, it may be expected that under pressure of time before it is possible to arrange a <i>Merton</i> assessment for itself it is likely to do so on an interim basis. <i>Assessing Age</i> contemplates that there will be co-operation between immigration officers and the local authority at the initial stage of dealing with an asylum seeker who may be a child.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Of course, there may be cases where it is very obvious that a person is under or over 18. In such cases there is normally no need for prolonged inquiry; indeed, if the person is obviously a child, no inquiry at all is called for. The present is not such a case. The difficulty normally only arises in cases, such as the present, where the person concerned is approaching 18 or is only a few years over 18. But the possibility of obvious cases means that it is not possible to prescribe the level or manner of inquiry so as sensibly to cover all cases.”</p>

The policy guidance in criterion C falls to be applied at the initial stage when immigration officers first encounter immigrants, when the only evidence available from which to make an assessment of their age may be their appearance and demeanour. The position is that Parliament intends that they should be able to detain the immigrant with a view to possible removal if it turns out that their immigration status warrants this and they do not have a good claim to asylum. Detention may in practice be important to ensure the effective application of immigration controls if, upon investigation, it transpires the immigrant has no good claim to remain in the UK. Where the immigrant is an unaccompanied child, this policy is adjusted to take account of their greater vulnerability, and this means that it is incumbent on immigration officers to assess whether they are dealing with a child or an adult. However, this involves no derogation from the general object of the legislation that immigration controls should be effective and that to this end adults should be subject to immigration detention in appropriate cases.</p>

The officers are required to apply the statutory regime as Parliament intended it should be applied (as supplemented prior to 28 July 2014 by the approach set out in the Secretary of State’s policy), and this means they must distinguish adults and children as best they can according to the evidence available to them. If immigration officers conclude that they are dealing with an adult, their duty is to apply the regime which is appropriate for an adult.</p>

The wider discussion in both versions of the EIG and <i>Assessing Age</i> stresses the same point, with the emphasis becoming stronger in the second version, as pointed out by Simon LJ. There is also an important safeguard built in, that two immigration officers of specified seniority should separately reach the same conclusion.</p> 
</a><a name="para59">
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is possible that these aspects of the policy, or something similar, were required by section 55(1)(a) of the 2009 Act, but it is not necessary to form any final view about that. It is sufficient to observe that the policy in criterion C has been formulated “having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom”, so that the Secretary of State has properly complied with her duty under section 55: see <i>R (AA (Afghanistan)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/49.html">[2013] UKSC 49</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/49.html">[2013] 1 WLR 2224</a>, paras 47-49 per Lord Toulson (“<i>AA (Afghanistan)</i>”). He held that by issuing the equivalent of version 1 of the EIG and of <i>Assessing Age</i>, including criterion C, the Secretary of State had complied with her duty under section 55 and that by acting in compliance with that policy guidance immigration officers also complied with that duty. Mr Hermer accepts that this is so and does not contend that section 55 imposes any obligation on the Secretary of State to go further than she has done in stating the policy to be applied. As Lord Toulson observed (para 49), “[t]he risk of an erroneous assessment can never be entirely eliminated but it can be minimised by a careful process and there are appropriate safeguards”, as were provided for in the EIG and <i>Assessing Age</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in her policy the Secretary of State has set out in a lawful way, so far as section 55 is concerned, the relatively generous degree to which the benefit of the doubt should be allowed to an immigrant who claims to be a child. As Mr Strachan points out, the policy, in particular as set out in criterion C, instructs immigration officers how they should proceed if they are <i>not</i> in doubt according to that standard. Where, after making due allowance for doubt to the degree instructed by the Secretary of State, immigration officers believe they are dealing with an adult, their duty is to treat the person as an adult so as to comply with the rule set by the Secretary of State and then by Parliament and to achieve the objectives which that rule is supposed to promote.</p> 
</a><a name="para61">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle in <i>Gillick</i> does not require anything different from this. The policy guidance given by the Secretary of State, in particular in criterion C, plainly does not direct immigration officers to act in a way which is in conflict with their legal duty. On the contrary, the policy recognises and reinforces the legal duties to which they are subject under the statutory regime, having regard to the limited evidence available to them when they are required to act. It directs them to treat immigrants they believe are children as children and to treat immigrants they believe are adults as adults.</p> 
</a><a name="para62">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two additional points may be made here. First, it might be thought that the outcome proposed by the majority in the Court of Appeal - according to which, in effect, the Secretary of State was required to direct immigration officers to treat a person as a child aged less than 18 only if they believe them to be aged less than 23 (or 25, depending on how one sets the margin of error) - itself risked being unlawful according to the <i>Gillick</i> principle, in the sense that it would appear to contradict the rule laid down by Parliament for immigration officers to apply, namely that they should treat a person who according to their judgment is 18 or over under the adult immigration regime. We do not need to decide whether section 55 might provide a legal justification for the Secretary of State to go so far, since it is conceded that it certainly imposes no obligation on her to do so. We do not consider that there is any other warrant for the Secretary of State to seek to displace the rule laid down by Parliament in this manner.</p> 
</a><a name="para63">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, leaving aside the issue of whether section 55 requires the Secretary of State to say anything about the application of the statutory rule, we do not consider that there is any obligation under the common law for her to have any policy at all in place to supplement what is said in the relevant statutory provisions. Those provisions lay down a clear rule that persons aged less than 18 should be treated as children, while those aged 18 or over should be treated as adults for the purposes of the legislative regime. The provisions do not confer any discretion on immigration officers on this point, though obviously they have to make an evaluative judgment on the basis of such evidence as is available to them whether a person is aged under 18 or not.</p>

We do not agree. The relevant part of the judgment of Lord Dyson in <i>Lumba</i>, at paras 20-39, was concerned with circumstances in which there may be an obligation to promulgate a policy to explain how a general statutory discretion might be exercised and the circumstances in which a policy should be made public. The judgment does not support the submission made by Mr Hermer that the Secretary of State was under an obligation in this case to state a policy in relation to what is a clear statutory rule.</p> 
<a name="para65">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This point serves to show, from another perspective, that there was no breach of obligation on the part of the Secretary of State in promulgating the policy in this case, in particular in the form of criterion C. The Secretary of State would have been entitled to have no policy at all as regards the application of paragraph 16(2A) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, or a policy which simply directed attention to the rule in that provision. It would be odd to conclude that, although the Secretary of State was under no obligation to say anything at all about the statutory rule, if she did promulgate a policy in relation to it she suddenly came under an obligation to specify in her policy that the rule should only be applied if any margin of error had been eliminated, by using 23 (or 25) as the relevant cut-off age to identify a person as a child instead of 18.</p> 
</a><a name="para66">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Hermer submitted that the Secretary of State was obliged to issue such a policy in place of criterion C because the new statutory provision, particularly as interpreted by the Court of Appeal in the <i>Ali</i> case, made it clear that it was unlawful to detain someone as an adult (even if reasonably believed to be an adult) when in fact they are a child. According to Mr Hermer, since it is clear that immigration officers would act unlawfully in such a case, the Secretary of State was under a duty to issue a policy which eliminated that possibility.</p> 
</a><a name="para67">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. As we have explained above, immigration officers would also act unlawfully, in the sense that they would defeat the purpose of the statutory regime, if they treated a person as a child when in fact they are an adult. Their obligation is to apply the statute in accordance with its terms according to their best judgment, formed in the light of the available evidence. The fact that they may make mistakes and that those mistakes may lead to unlawfulness of different kinds depending on whether they wrongly conclude a person is an adult or wrongly conclude they are a child does not affect the nature of their duty. Clearly, given the difficulties of assessment in marginal cases, if the Secretary of State issued a policy requiring immigration officers always to conclude that a person is a child unless they seem to be aged 23 (or 25) or over, that would produce a large number of erroneous identifications of adults as children, thereby undermining the purpose of the statute. The fact that damages for false imprisonment would be payable if immigration officers make an opposite error, concluding that a person is an adult and accordingly detaining them whereas it is ultimately established in court proceedings that they are a child does not change this. It simply means that a child who is wrongly treated as an adult may have a range of legal remedies available to them, and their interest may to that extent be better protected. The public interest to have immigration rules properly applied and illegal immigrants removed is not affected by this.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle in UNISON</p> 
</a><a name="para68">

But in the present case, nothing in the policy promulgated by the Secretary of State creates any impediment for an immigrant in gaining access to the courts for the determination of their rights.</p> 
</a><a name="para69">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have sought to explain in the <i>A</i> case (paras 73, 75 and 80), we respectfully consider that the Court of Appeal erred in the present case by mixing together the principle with which <i>UNISON</i> is concerned and the distinct jurisprudence on inherent systemic unfairness in cases such as <i>Refugee Legal Centre</i> in order to arrive at the test which it applied in relation to criterion C. As we have mentioned, Mr Hermer did not seek to support the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in so far as it rested on the latter cases.</p> 
</a><a name="para70">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, we consider that, contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the judgment of Lord Mance in the <i>Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission</i> case, at para 82, provides no support for the test applied in this case: see our judgment in the <i>A</i> case, para 78. When reviewing, on a prospective basis, the compatibility of domestic legislation with one of the Convention rights set out in the Human Rights Act 1998, Lord Mance said that “[t]he relevant question is whether the legislation itself is capable of being operated in a manner which is compatible with that right, or, putting the same point the other way around, whether it is bound in a legally significant number of cases to lead to unjustified infringement of the right”. This is a test which is similar to that in <i>Gillick</i>, in that it involves comparison of two normative statements, by looking to see if action as directed by the legislation will necessarily involve a violation of the Convention right in a significant number of cases.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obligations derived from Convention rights</p>

However, Ms Christie for the intervener referred to several. In our view, however, they do not provide support for the decision of the Court of Appeal and do not provide relevant guidance applicable in this case. We refer to our judgment in the <i>A</i> case at paras 49-53 and 76-79.</p> 
</a><a name="para72">

No such obligation is engaged in the context of the present case.</p> 
</a><a name="para73">
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73">73.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms Christie relied on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Storck</i>. This was a case involving the detention of an individual by a private person. The issue arose whether the state could incur liability under article 5 of the ECHR in respect of the detention. Ms Christie relied on a passage at paras 101-102 in which the court held that article 5 lays down a positive obligation on the state to protect the liberty of individuals, so the state’s responsibility was engaged. However, the present case is concerned with detention by the state and it is not in doubt that the state has responsibility in relation to that, nor that article 5 is applicable in such cases. Article 5(1)(f) permits “the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition”. Article 5 includes a requirement that detention according to national law must not be arbitrary: <i>Saadi v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/80.html">(2008) 47 EHRR 17</a>, GC, paras 61-74. It is not suggested that the detention of the respondent was arbitrary. It arose from the application of a rule which drew a clear and legitimate distinction between the treatment of adults and children and was based on a genuine and considered assessment by two immigration officers that he was an adult. More germanely, it cannot be said that article 5 imposes any obligation on the Secretary of State to put in place a policy of the kind discussed by the Court of Appeal. As this court held in <i>AA (Afghanistan)</i>, paras 44-49, section 55 is compatible with article 5 and detention in accordance with the policy guidance in the EIG and <i>Assessing Age</i> will be compliant with article 5.</p>

At all material times, the relevant parts of the policy she maintained in place, and criterion C in particular, were lawful.</p> </a></div><a name="para74">
