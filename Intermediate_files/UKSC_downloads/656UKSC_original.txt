</span>The financial problems of Mrs Takhar arose mainly from the condition of
the properties which she had acquired from her husband. Some were in a
dilapidated condition. Payment for rates were in arrears. Bankruptcy for Mrs
Takhar was in prospect.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Krishans provided financial help to Mrs Takhar. Dr Krishan, the
second respondent and the third respondent’s husband, took on responsibility for
negotiating with Coventry City Council over the rates arrears and the
dilapidated state of some of the buildings. Then, in November 2005 it was agreed
that the legal title to the properties would be transferred to Gracefield Developments
Ltd, a newly formed company, of which Mrs Takhar and the Krishans were to be
the shareholders and directors.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mrs Takhar claims that it had been agreed between her and the Krishans
that the properties would be renovated and then let. The rent would be used to
defray the cost of the renovation, which, in the short term, would be met by
the Krishans. Mrs Takhar would remain the beneficial owner of the properties.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Krishans present a very different account. They claim that
Gracefield was set up as a joint venture company. The properties were to be
sold after they had been renovated. They were to be given an agreed value and
this would be paid to Mrs Takhar after they had been sold. Any profit over
would be divided equally between Mrs Takhar and the Krishans. They explain that
Mrs Takhar agreed to these arrangements because planning permission for
development had to be obtained in order to realise the value of the properties
and this was an area in which Dr Krishan had experience, having already successfully
developed his own medical centre.</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="ParaHeading">The proceedings</p>

</span>On 24 October 2008, Mrs Takhar, issued proceedings in the Birmingham
District Registry of the Chancery Division. She claimed that the properties had
been transferred to Gracefield as a result of undue influence or other unconscionable
conduct on the part of Dr and Mrs Krishan. In a judgment delivered on 28 July
2010 [2010] EWHC 2872 (Ch), His Honour Judge Purle QC rejected that claim.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A significant item of evidence in the hearing before Judge Purle was a written
profit share agreement dated 1 April 2006. It provided for an initial purchase
price of £100,000 for the properties. This was to be placed on a loan account
with Gracefield. Further sums totalling £200,000 as deferred consideration were
also provided for. The total of £300,000 was to be paid to Mrs Takhar on
completion of the sale of the properties. She was also to receive 50% of the
profits on the sale of each property.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The circumstances in which this written agreement was discovered and Mrs
Takhar’s evidence about it were described by Judge Purle in paras 21 and 22 of
his judgment:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… no case of forgery is advanced.
Only the last page of the version of the agreement signed by Mrs Takhar appears
to have survived and that is in the form of a scanned copy, which has emerged
in the files of Sue Bowdler’s firm [the Krishans’ solicitors]. It was misfiled,
apparently. Sue Bowdler had not seen the copy with Mrs Takhar’s signature on it
before until it was found, misfiled. However, there is no doubt that the
agreement was prepared for signature. There is no doubt also that the agreement
was prepared for signature in or around April 2006 and there is no doubt, in my
mind, that it faithfully reflects the oral agreement that had been made<span style="font-size:11.5pt">.</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> of </span>Mrs Takhar giving a coherent explanation as
to how her signature came to be on the scanned copy, I conclude that the
Krishans’ evidence, which I believe anyway, should be accepted and that Mrs
Takhar took the copy of the agreement that she was to sign away, which was
returned, probably by her in some way, duly executed to Sue Bowdler’s firm,
which then ended up misfiled. At all events, I am satisfied that that was the
agreement that was made. The properties were transferred by Mrs Takhar in to
Gracefield’s name before the written joint venture agreement was prepared, and
the only credible explanation that I have heard is that they were so
transferred on the terms subsequently set out in the joint venture agreement,
which were previously agreed orally.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This was, therefore, powerful evidence in support of the Krishans’ case.
And it is unsurprising that it was heavily relied on by the judge. As the
quoted passage shows, he found that the written agreement represented what had
earlier been agreed orally between Mrs Takhar and the Krishans. The judge
therefore held that Mrs Takhar had transferred the properties to Gracefield for
the sum of £300,000 and that she was to receive 50% of the profits when the
properties were sold. He dismissed Mrs Takhar’s claim based on undue influence
or unconscionable bargain and held that the properties had been transferred to
Gracefield both legally and beneficially. That transfer was, he held, subject
to the terms of the oral agreement made between the parties, as reflected in
the written profit share agreement.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The original of the profit share agreement said to have been signed by
Mrs Takhar has not been found. The Krishans claim that it was prepared by
accountants at a time when Mrs Takhar was in India and then handed to her when
she returned. She was asked to consider it and return it to the accountants.
Mrs Takhar’s case is that she did not sign the document and had never seen it
until the dispute arose. The authenticity of the document and whether it had
been signed by Mrs Takhar are central issues in the dispute between the
parties, therefore.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In advance of the trial before Judge Purle, Mrs Takhar had sought
permission to obtain evidence from a handwriting expert to examine the
signature on the profit share agreement which had been attributed to her. That
application was refused because it had not been made until the trial was
imminent. On the trial, Mrs Takhar gave evidence that she could not say that
the signature on the profit share agreement was not hers, but she was unable to
explain how it had got there.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After the trial Mrs Takhar instructed new solicitors and asked them to
obtain a report from a handwriting expert. Robert Radley is such an expert and
he was engaged to inspect and report on various documents. His subsequent
report stated conclusively that the signature on the profit share agreement
which purported to be that of Mrs Takhar had been transposed from a letter of
24 March 2006 which she had sent to the Krishans’ solicitors. He was also of
the opinion that there was strong evidence that Mrs Takhar did not sign a 2006
bank inquiry form and that the signatures of both the Krishans and Mrs Takhar
on later 2011 bank inquiry forms had also been transposed from previous forms.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On foot of this report, Mrs Takhar claims that she can now advance a
case of fraud against the Krishans. She also claims that she was not in a
position to do so until she had received Mr Radley’s report. The Krishans
dispute both claims.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After receiving Mr Radley’s report, Mrs Takhar issued proceedings in
which she sought to have Judge Purle’s judgment and order set aside. She
claimed that she was entitled to this relief on the ground that it was obtained
by fraud, the principal forgery relied upon being that of the copy of the
profit share agreement. (Later Mrs Takhar applied for permission to amend her
claim to allege an unlawful means conspiracy and deceit. That application was
refused and no longer features in the appeal.)</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents served defences in which they pleaded that Mrs Takhar’s
claim is an abuse of process, inter alia because the documents on which Mr
Radley’s report was based were available to Mrs Takhar and her legal team since
at least 12 July 2009 (approximately 12 months earlier than the trial before
Judge Purle).</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was ordered that the question whether Mrs Takhar’s claim amounted to
an abuse of process be tried as a preliminary issue. That trial took place
before Newey J in February 2015. In his judgment, (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2015/1276.html">[2015] EWHC 1276 (Ch)</a>),
Newey J held that a party who seeks to set aside a judgment on the basis that
it was obtained by fraud did not have to demonstrate that he could not have
discovered the fraud by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The present claim
was therefore not an abuse of process.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents appealed. The Court of Appeal (Patten, King and Simon LJJ)
allowed the appeal in its judgment delivered on 21 March 2017 (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/147.html">[2018] Ch 1</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/147.html">[2017] 3 WLR 853</a>; [2017] CP Rep 23). Patten LJ, delivering the leading
judgment, said at para 30 that the appeal turned on whether Newey J was correct
in holding that a due diligence condition did not need to be satisfied.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ began his examination of that issue by a reference to the
judgment of Wigram V-C in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>. In
that case the Vice Chancellor had said that where a matter had been the subject
of litigation and adjudication by a court, it was required of the parties that
they “bring forward their whole case” (at p 115). When litigation had taken
place, it would only be in exceptional circumstances that parties could “open
the same subject of litigation in respect of matter[s] which might have been
brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which [had not been] …
brought forward” because of “negligence, inadvertence, or even accident”. This
applied to “every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation,
and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought
forward at the time”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Henderson</i> is certainly authority for the general principle that
parties must normally advance the totality of their case on the first bout of
litigation. It is not open to them, save in exceptional circumstances, to bring
up a point which should have been raised in that litigation and which could,
with reasonable diligence, have been discovered and canvassed on the first
trial. <i>Henderson</i> does not speak, however, on two subjects which are
critical in the present case. The first of these is whether the rule applies where
the new point was not in issue between the parties on the first trial and
where, if it had been and evidence on the point had been led, a different
outcome might have ensued. The second subject concerns the question whether the
rule in <i>Henderson</i> requires modification or disapplication where the new
issue raises an allegation of fraud by which, it is claimed, the original
judgment was obtained.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second case on this subject referred to by Patten LJ was <i>Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd (formerly Contour Aerospace Ltd)</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/46.html">[2014] AC 160</a>. In his judgment in that case, Lord Sumption rejected the
suggestion that the principle propounded in <i>Henderson</i> should be treated
as applying only to the law governing abuse of process and not as an application
of the doctrine of res judicata. At para 26, Lord Sumption had said that, “[w]here
the existence or non-existence of a cause of action has been decided in earlier
proceedings, to allow a direct challenge to the outcome, even in changed
circumstances and with material not available before, offends the core policy
against the re-litigation of identical claims.” I do not consider that Lord
Sumption’s statement in this passage has any bearing on the issues which arise
on this appeal. The “existence or non-existence” of fraud has not been decided
in the proceedings before Judge Purle. It is a new issue. It does not involve
the re-litigation of an identical claim.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <i>Virgin Atlantic</i> case, Lord Sumption had considered the
House of Lords decision in <i>Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</i> [1991]
2 AC 93. In that case, Lord Keith had drawn a distinction between cause of
action estoppel and issue estoppel. At p 104, Lord Keith had described cause of
action estoppel in this way:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Cause of action estoppel arises
where the cause of action in the later proceedings is identical to that in the
earlier proceedings, the latter having been between the same parties or their
privies and having involved the same subject matter. In such a case the bar is
absolute in relation to all points decided unless fraud or collusion is
alleged, such as to justify setting aside the earlier judgment.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He considered that a distinction between this and issue estoppel should
be recognised and said, at p 109:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my opinion your Lordships
should affirm it to be the law that there may be an exception to issue estoppel
in the special circumstance that there has become available to a party further
material relevant to the correct determination of a point involved in the
earlier proceedings, whether or not that point was specifically raised and
decided, being material which could not by reasonable diligence have been
adduced in those proceedings.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 35 of the judgment in the present appeal, Patten LJ said this
about Lord Keith’s speech in <i>Arnold</i>:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“These passages in Lord Keith’s
speech in <i>Arnold</i> were affirmed by the Supreme Court in <i>Virgin
Atlantic</i> and have to be treated as settled law so far as this court is
concerned. It is therefore clear that even in a case of issue estoppel the
point cannot be re-litigated unless the new material could not with due
diligence have been produced at the earlier hearing: see Lord Sumption at para
22. It follows that Mrs Takhar would not be able to re-litigate the issue of
the terms of the November 2005 agreement unless she can rely on evidence that
she could not with due diligence have produced at the trial.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is important to note that Lord Keith, in the first passage quoted, at
para 22 above, (dealing with cause of action estoppel), does not suggest that
there is a reasonable diligence requirement in cases of fraud or collusion. And
in the second passage, at para 23 above, (which concerns issue estoppel) he
does not mention fraud at all. In my opinion, it is not to be assumed that Lord
Keith was suggesting that due diligence was a prerequisite in cases of fraud.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ had referred to Lord Sumption’s judgment in <i>Virgin</i> <i>Atlantic</i>,
para 22, as supporting the proposition that a fresh point could not be
relitigated unless the new material could not with reasonable diligence have
been produced at the earlier hearing. It is important to note exactly what Lord
Sumption said at para 22 in <i>Virgin Atlantic</i>:</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<i>Arnold v National Westminster
Bank plc</i> [1991] 2 AC 93 is accordingly authority for the following
propositions. (1) Cause of action estoppel is absolute in relation to all
points which had to be and were decided in order to establish the existence or
non-existence of a cause of action. (2) Cause of action estoppel also bars the
raising in subsequent proceedings of points essential to the existence or
non-existence of a cause of action which were not decided because they were not
raised in the earlier proceedings, if they could with reasonable diligence and
should in all the circumstances have been raised. (3) Except in special
circumstances where this would cause injustice, issue estoppel bars the raising
in subsequent proceedings of points which (i) were not raised in the earlier
proceedings or (ii) were raised but unsuccessfully. If the relevant point was
not raised, the bar will usually be absolute if it could with reasonable
diligence and should in all the circumstances have been raised.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The significance of this paragraph, so far as concerns the present case,
lies in what it does not assert and the qualifications which it contains. It
does not address the question of fraud at all. Moreover, the first proposition
which Lord Sumption makes, that cause of action estoppel is an absolute bar in
relation to such points as had to be and were decided in order to establish the
existence or non-existence of a cause of action, is of no relevance at all in
the present appeal. The case before Judge Purle did not involve an allegation
of fraud on the part of the Krishans. The points which “had to be or were
decided” in Mrs Takhar’s case before Judge Purle were not concerned with
possible fraud.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second proposition in Lord Sumption’s para 22, that cause of action
estoppel prohibits the raising of points in subsequent proceedings which had
not been decided because they were not raised in the earlier proceedings, must
be read in context. Again, the issue of fraud is not mentioned. And Lord
Sumption has expressly espoused the reasoning of Lord Keith in <i>Arnold</i>
where reasonable diligence is not said to be a requirement in cases of fraud or
collusion. Given that, I do not consider that the second proposition in para 22
of <i>Virgin Atlantic</i> should be interpreted as covering cases of fraud.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to issue estoppel and the third proposition in para 22, it is clear
that Lord Sumption did not prescribe a universally applicable rule. He was
careful to qualify his statement (that issue estoppel bars the raising in
subsequent proceedings of points which were not raised in the earlier
proceedings or were raised but unsuccessfully), by saying that the bar will <i>usually</i>
be absolute if it could with reasonable diligence and should in all the
circumstances have been raised. And, of course, there is again no mention of
fraud in this context. I do not consider, therefore, that <i>Virgin Atlantic </i>is
authority for the proposition expressed by Patten LJ.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, at para 37, Patten LJ accepted the submission of Mr
Wardell QC (who appeared on behalf of Mrs Takhar before the Court of Appeal and
this court) that the “obstacle faced by Mrs Takhar was not one of issue
estoppel”. He also accepted that she was not challenging an earlier decision of
the judge about the authenticity of the profit share agreement. As Patten LJ
observed, “[t]he allegation about her signature being forged was not raised or
decided at the trial of the 2008 action.”</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the Court of Appeal considered that, although it was not concerned
with a question of res judicata in the strict sense of issue or cause of action
estoppel, it had to deal with what it described, at para 37, as “the wider
policy considerations embodied in the rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>”.<i>
</i>Those policy considerations were engaged, Patten LJ said, “whenever a litigant
seeks to challenge an earlier decision of a competent court, whether directly
or indirectly, by commencing new proceedings in which the same issues arise or
seeks directly by way of appeal to challenge the judge’s decision on the basis
of new evidence.”. On that account, Patten LJ concluded, “If the challenge … is
by way of an action seeking to set the judge’s order aside on the ground that
it was obtained by fraud the real question … is whether this amounts to an
abuse of process if the success of the action depends upon evidence which could
with reasonable diligence have been produced at the earlier trial.”</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not agree with this conclusion. In the first instance, this is not
a case of commencing new proceedings where the same issues arise. As Patten LJ
had earlier said, the question of Mrs Takhar’s signature having been forged had
not been raised or decided in the trial before Judge Purle. The appellant does
not seek to set aside Judge Purle’s decision on any of the issues decided by
him. Secondly, for the reasons that I have given, I do not consider that in <i>Arnold
</i>or <i>Virgin Atlantic </i>there has been an unequivocal judicial statement
that seeking to set aside a judgment on the basis that it was obtained by fraud
constitutes an abuse of process, if evidence of the fraud could, with
reasonable diligence, have been obtained and produced at the earlier trial.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>I accept, however, that the question whether fraud should “unravel all”
even where discovery of its existence was possible before the original trial
does give rise to intensely relevant policy considerations. These are
considered in the next section of this judgment.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 38 Patten LJ referred to the case of <i>Phosphate Sewage Co Ltd
v Molleson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/1879/16SLR0822.html">(1879) 4 App Cas 801</a>. It had been argued in that case that
evidence of fraud other than that presented at the original trial should be
allowed to enable a company to claim repayment of a sum which it had paid to a
bankrupt. The company had subsequently obtained further evidence of the fraud. It
sought to advance a new case founded on that evidence. The House of Lords held
that the new allegations of fraud were based on facts within the company’s
knowledge at the time of the first trial. The plea of res judicata succeeded,
therefore. Importantly, Earl Cairns LC said, at p 814, that it would be
“intolerable” if a party who had been unsuccessful in litigation could re-open
it merely because,</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… since the former litigation
there is another fact going exactly in the same direction with the facts stated
before, leading up to the same relief [as had been] asked for before, but it being
in addition to the facts [in the previous litigation], it ought now to be
allowed to be the foundation of a new litigation, and [he] should be allowed to
commence a new litigation merely upon the allegation of this additional fact.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The contrast with the present case is immediately obvious. This is not
an instance of the appellant seeking to adduce evidence of facts “going in the
same direction” as facts previously stated, because Mrs Takhar had not asserted
that the Krishans had been guilty of fraud, merely that she had no recollection
of having signed the profit share agreement. The relief that she seeks now is
quite different from that which she had earlier claimed. Previously, she sought
to avoid the effect of the agreement because of undue influence and
unconscionability on the part of the Krishans. Now she claims that the
agreement on which they rely was, in its written form, a forgery.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now, it is true that Earl Cairns had also said in the <i>Phosphate
Sewage </i>case, at p 814, that “the only way in which [new evidence] could
possibly be admitted would be if the litigant were prepared to say, I will shew
you that this is a fact which entirely changes the aspect of the case, and I
will shew you further that it was not, and could not by reasonable diligence
have been, ascertained by me before.” But the essential context of this
observation is set by the earlier passage quoted above. It is where precisely
the same relief as had previously been claimed is sought again. In my view, it
is not appropriate to lift the requirement of reasonable diligence out of the
context in which it appears and to import it into a different scenario, namely,
where a changed basis for success for the appellant is advanced.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ acknowledged that Earl Cairns’ statement of principle was
expressed in relation to a plea of res judicata and that that was how it had
been treated by Lord Keith in <i>Arnold </i>(para 39, per Patten LJ). But he
suggested that the rule expressed by Earl Cairns was said by Lord Diplock in <i>Hunter
v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html">[1982] AC 529</a> to be “relevant
more generally as a statement of the conditions which must be satisfied to justify
a departure from the policy of not permitting a party to challenge prior
decisions by a court of competent jurisdiction in which case it is relevant to
whether it would be an abuse of process to seek to set a judgment aside without
satisfying the reasonable diligence condition.” (Patten LJ, also at para 39.)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Again, it is important to recognise the context in which Lord Diplock
made his remarks about the application of the rule. <i>Hunter </i>was a case in
which those who had been convicted of planting bombs in Birmingham sought to
establish, by civil action, that they had been subjected to ill-treatment
before they confessed to involvement in the bombings. This was described as a
collateral attack on the correctness of their convictions. At p 545 Lord Diplock
said:</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There remains to be considered
the circumstances in which the existence at the commencement of the civil
action of ‘fresh evidence’ obtained since the criminal trial and the probative
weight of such evidence justify making an exception to the general rule of public
policy that the use of civil actions to initiate collateral attacks on final decisions
against the intending plaintiff by criminal courts of competent jurisdiction
should be treated as an abuse of the process of the court.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The context of the issue in <i>Hunter </i>is therefore firmly set. It is
whether a challenge to the correctness of a criminal conviction amounts to an
abuse of process. This is, self-evidently, an entirely different situation from
that which arises in the present case. And it immediately gives rise to concern
about whether it is acceptable to apply a test fashioned for the circumstances
of collateral challenge to a criminal conviction to the markedly dissimilar
setting of seeking to set aside a civil judgment because it was obtained by a
fraud which had not been alleged or adjudicated on at the original trial.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ referred to the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Owens Bank
Ltd v Etoile Commerciale SA </i>[1995] 1 WLR 44, (“<i>Etoile</i>”) where Lord
Templeman had said:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An English judgment is
impeachable in an English court on the ground that the first judgment was
obtained by fraud but only by the production and establishment of evidence
newly discovered since the trial and not reasonably discoverable before the
trial: see <i>Boswell v Coaks (No 2) </i>(1894) 86 LT 365n.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As Newey J observed in his judgment in the present case,
the reasonable diligence test is not to be found in <i>Boswell v Coaks </i>(which
Lord Templeman had cited as authority that it was required). Moreover, the <i>Etoile
</i>case involved a decision by the Court of Appeal of St Vincent and the
Grenadines that an action claiming damages for fraud should be struck out as an
abuse of process in circumstances where in earlier proceedings in France it had
been alleged that the date on a critical document had been forged - in effect,
an allegation of fraud. That case had been rejected by the French court, so
that the position in the <i>Etoile </i>case was that the bank sought to rely
for a second time on fraud. This distinguishes it from the present appeal. In
any event, the Board dismissed the appeal on the basis that it was for the St
Vincent courts to control their own process and to decide whether the bank’s
attempt to re-open the issue of fraud was an abuse of it. Lord Templeman’s
remarks were therefore obiter.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Newey J’s criticism of Lord Templeman’s statement of principle was
rejected by Patten LJ. He suggested that this was consistent with the earlier
decision of the House of Lords in <i>Owens Bank Ltd v Bracco </i>[1992] 2 AC
443 (<i>Bracco</i>). In that case Lord Bridge, at p 483, had articulated “the
common law rule” in this area as being:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… that the unsuccessful party who
has been sued to judgment is not permitted to challenge that judgment on the
ground that it was obtained by fraud unless he is able to prove that fraud by
fresh evidence which was not available to him and could not have been
discovered with reasonable diligence before the judgment was delivered.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is important to be mindful of the rider which Lord
Bridge added to this exposition, however. Later, in the same passage he said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The rule rests on the principle
that there must be finality in litigation which would be defeated if it were
open to the unsuccessful party in one action to bring a second action <i>to
relitigate the issue determined against him</i> simply on the ground that the opposing
party had obtained judgment in the first action by perjured evidence.”
(Emphasis added)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The rule is therefore expressed to apply when there is a proposed re-litigation
of the issue of fraud which had been determined in the earlier litigation. That
is not the position here. Mrs Takhar seeks to raise the fraud of the Krishans
for the first time. It should be noted that Lord Bridge referred to re-litigation
of <i>the issue</i> which had been determined against the party seeking to
reopen the case. The issue of the Krishans’ alleged fraud has not been
determined. I do not consider, therefore, that <i>Bracco </i>forbids a
challenge to a judgment which, it is claimed, was obtained by fraud, where that
issue was not canvassed at the first trial. Likewise, it does not prohibit Mrs
Takhar from pursuing her present action.</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="ParaHeading">Is fraud “a thing apart”; does it “unravel all”?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/6.html">[2003] 2 Lloyds Rep 61</a>, para 15, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… fraud is a thing apart. This is
not a mere slogan. It also reflects an old legal rule that fraud unravels all …
once fraud is proved, ‘it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions
whatsoever’: <i>Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley </i>[1956] 1 All ER 341 at 345,
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1956/6.html">[1956] 1 QB 702</a> at 712 per Denning LJ. Parties entering into a commercial
contract will no doubt recognise and accept the risk of errors and omissions in
the preceding negotiations, even negligent errors and omissions. But each party
will assume the honesty and good faith of the other; absent such an assumption
they would not deal.”</p>

</span>This reflects the basic principle that the law does not expect people to
arrange their affairs on the basis that others may commit fraud. It also
carries echoes of what Lord Wilberforce said in <i>The</i> <i>Ampthill Peerage</i>
[1977] AC 547, 569:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… any determination of disputable
fact may, the law recognises, be imperfect: the law aims at providing the best
and safest solution ... and having reached that solution it closes the book ...
in the interest of peace, certainty and security it prevents further inquiry
... there are cases where the certainty of justice prevails over the
possibility of truth ... and these are cases where the law insists on finality.
For a policy of closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended with
safeguards: so the law allows appeals: so the law, exceptionally, allows
appeals out of time: so the law still more exceptionally allows judgments to be
attacked on the ground of fraud.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This passage from Lord Wilberforce’s speech resonates with earlier
authority. In <i>Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia &amp; Co </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1918/1918_65.html">[1918] AC 888</a>, 894, Lord
Buckmaster said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In all applications for a new
trial the fundamental ground must be that there has been a miscarriage of
justice. If no charge of fraud or surprise is brought forward, it is not
sufficient to show that there was further evidence that could have been adduced
to support the claim of the losing parties; the applicant must go further and
show that the evidence was of such a character that it would, so far as can be
foreseen, have formed a determining factor in the result. Such considerations
do not apply to questions of surprise, and still less to questions of fraud. A judgment
that is tainted and affected by fraudulent conduct is tainted throughout, and
the whole must fail …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The clear implication from this statement is that in cases of fraud,
unlike other instances of claimed miscarriages of justice, it is not necessary
to show that the further evidence would have been a determining factor in the
result. And, if it was not necessary to show that, it could hardly be said that
it would have to be shown that evidence of the fraud could not have been
obtained before the first trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence (a more
rigorous requirement, by any standard).</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A need to show reasonable diligence did not feature in <i>Jonesco v
Beard </i>[1930] AC 298, where an application was made to set aside a judgment
obtained by fraud. At p 300, Lord Buckmaster said</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the proper method of impeaching a
completed judgment on the ground of fraud is by action in which, as in any
other action based on fraud, the particulars of the fraud must be exactly given
and the allegations established by the strict proof such a charge requires.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">No mention was made of a need to show that evidence of
the fraud could not have been uncovered by reasonable diligence. If that was
deemed to be a requirement, it would surely have been mentioned at this point.
This is particularly so because affidavits relating to evidence other than
fraud, which had not been produced at the trial, were said by Lord Buckmaster
not to be capable of sustaining the case for setting aside the judgment because
“there was no sufficient explanation of why the evidence had not been made
available at the trial” (at p 300). The same stricture was not applied to the
argument in relation to fraud.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The special place occupied by fraud in the setting aside of judgments
obtained by its use has been recognised in Australia and Canada. In <i>McDonald
v McDonald </i>(1965) 113 CLR 529 the High Court of Australia applied <i>Hip
Foong Hong </i>and <i>Jonesco v Beard </i>and rejected the notion that, to set
aside a judgment obtained by fraud, it had to be shown that evidence of the
fraud could not have been obtained by reasonable diligence before the trial
which led to the judgment sought to be set aside. Barwick CJ contrasted the
position where a verdict was impeached on the basis of fresh evidence with that
where it was obtained by fraud. At p 533 he said:</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But if the fresh evidence does
not satisfy all these requirements so that a new trial could not be ordered on
the basis of the discovery of fresh evidence, but does tend to establish that
the verdict was obtained by fraud ... the court may grant a new trial ... if
the court ... finds the fact of the fraud ... to be proved …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">At p 542, Menzies J discussed the grounds on which a new
trial can be ordered on the basis of fresh evidence and then observed, “[t]his
leaves untouched the rule that, if by any means it be proved affirmatively that
the earlier judgment was tainted by fraud, <i>it will, without more, </i>be set
aside.” (Emphasis added)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This decision was followed in <i>Toubia v Schwenke </i>[2002] NSWCA 34;
(2002) 54 NSWLR 46. As Newey J stated in para 33 of his judgment in this case,
in <i>Toubia </i>Handley JA, with whom Heydon JA and Hodgson JA agreed,
concluded (in para 41) that “[i]n an action for fraud, a plaintiff must prove
that he was deceived but need not prove that he was diligent.” Handley JA
continued:</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para49">“Where the action seeks the
judicial rescission of a judgment, the plaintiff must prove that he and the court
were deceived and he can only do this by showing that he has discovered the truth
since the trial. Where this is done, and the fresh facts are material, fraud is
established. Lord Buckmaster [in <i>Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia and Co </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1918/1918_65.html">[1918] AC 888</a>] said that if fraud was proved the judgment was vitiated, and he can
only have meant that nothing else had to be proved apart from fraud. That means
there is no need to prove due diligence as well.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50">50.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Handley JA, in an earlier passage of his judgment, gave a powerful
defence of this principle. Referring to the argument that the dicta in <i>Owens
Bank Ltd v</i> <i>Bracco </i>[1992] AC 443 were to the effect that, if fraud
was alleged (even for the first time) in an application to set aside a
judgment, it had to be shown that it could not have been discovered with
reasonable diligence, at paras 37 and 38 he said:</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para50">“37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not follow the dicta
in <i>Owens Bank Ltd v Bracco, Owens Bank Ltd v Etoile Commerciale SA</i>, …
even if there was no High Court decision [in <i>McDonald v McDonald</i>] on the
point because, with respect, the dicta are contrary to principle and earlier
authority. The assumption is that the court and the losing party were successfully
imposed on by the fraud of the successful party, but relief should nevertheless
be denied and the judgment allowed to stand because the defrauded party was
careless or lacked diligence in the preparation of his case. … Contributory
negligence is not a defence to an action for fraud whether the relief claimed
is rescission or damages. As Brennan J said in <i>Gould v Vaggelas</i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/68.html ">(1984)
157 CLR 215</a>, 252:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘A knave does not escape
liability because he is dealing with a fool.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Means of knowledge of
the falsity of the representation without actual knowledge is no defence and a representee
has no duty to make inquiries to ascertain the truth.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Canada v Granitile Inc </i></a><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/21rph">(2008) 302 DLR (4th) 40</a>, the Ontario
Superior Court of Justice reached the same conclusion. At para 299, Lederer J
said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A failure to exercise due
diligence, where fraud might otherwise have been discovered, is not enough to
sustain a judgment which resulted from that fraud.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He developed that theme at para 303 where he said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“All of this is consistent with
and in furtherance of the fundamental proposition that ‘Fraud unravels
everything’ ... We are not required to be ‘perpetually on guard’ so that we are
looking to discover the fraud of another party ... Where fraud is present,
finality will give way to the responsibility of the court to protect its
process ‘so as to ensure that litigants do not profit from their improper
conduct’ ...”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Newey J found the reasoning in the Australian and Canadian cases
compelling. I also. The idea that a fraudulent individual should profit from
passivity or lack of reasonable diligence on the part of his or her opponent
seems antithetical to any notion of justice. Quite apart from this, the
defrauder, in obtaining a judgment, has perpetrated a deception not only on
their opponent and the court but on the rule of law. Newey J put it well when
he said, at para 37 of his judgment:</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Supposing that a party to a case
in which judgment had been given against him could show that his opponent had
obtained the judgment entirely on the strength of, say, concocted documentation
and perjured evidence, it would strike me as wrong if he could not challenge
the judgment even if the fraud could reasonably have been discovered. Were it
impossible to impugn the judgment, the winner could presumably have been sent
to prison for his fraudulent conduct and yet able to enforce the judgment he
had procured by means of it: the judgment could still, in effect, be used to
further the fraud.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with all of that. It appears to me that the policy arguments for
permitting a litigant to apply to have judgment set aside where it can be shown
that it has been obtained by fraud are overwhelming.</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons that I have given, I do not consider that the <i>Etoile </i>and
<i>Bracco </i>cases are authority for the proposition that, in cases where it
is alleged that a judgment was obtained by fraud, it may only be set aside
where the party who makes that application can demonstrate that the fraud could
not have been uncovered with reasonable diligence in advance of the obtaining
of the judgment. If, however, they have that effect, I consider that they
should not be followed. In my view, it ought now to be recognised that where it
can be shown that a judgment has been obtained by fraud, and where no
allegation of fraud had been raised at the trial which led to that judgment, a
requirement of reasonable diligence should not be imposed on the party seeking
to set aside the judgment.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Two qualifications to that general conclusion should be made. Where
fraud has been raised at the original trial and new evidence as to the
existence of the fraud is prayed in aid to advance a case for setting aside the
judgment, it seems to me that it can be argued that the court having to deal
with that application should have a discretion as to whether to entertain the
application. Since that question does not arise in the present appeal, I do not
express any final view on it. The second relates to the possibility that, in
some circumstances, a deliberate decision may have been taken not to
investigate the possibility of fraud in advance of the first trial, even if
that had been suspected. If that could be established, again, I believe that a
discretion whether to allow an application to set aside the judgment would be
appropriate but, once more, I express no final view on the question. In Mrs
Takhar’s case, she did suspect that there may have been fraud but it is clear
that she did not make a conscious decision not to investigate it. To the
contrary, she sought permission to engage an expert but, as already explained,
this application was refused.</a></p><a name="para55">

</span>At para 26 of his judgment, Newey J said that the principles which
govern applications to set aside judgments for fraud had been summarised by
Aikens LJ in <i>Royal Bank of Scotland plc v</i> <i>Highland Financial Partners
lp</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/328.html">[2013] 1 CLC 596</a>, para 106. There, Aikens LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principles are, briefly:
first, there has to be a ‘conscious and deliberate dishonesty’ in relation to
the relevant evidence given, or action taken, statement made or matter concealed,
which is relevant to the judgment now sought to be impugned. Secondly, the
relevant evidence, action, statement or concealment (performed with conscious
and deliberate dishonesty) must be ‘material’. ‘Material’ means that the fresh evidence
that is adduced after the first judgment has been given is such that it
demonstrates that the previous relevant evidence, action, statement or
concealment was an operative cause of the court’s decision to give judgment in
the way it did. Put another way, it must be shown that the fresh evidence would
have entirely changed the way in which the first court approached and came to
its decision. Thus the relevant conscious and deliberate dishonesty must be
causative of the impugned judgment being obtained in the terms it was. Thirdly,
the question of materiality of the fresh evidence is to be assessed by
reference to its impact on the evidence supporting the original decision, not
by reference to its impact on what decision might be made if the claim were to
be retried on honest evidence.”</p>

</span>I agree that these are the relevant principles to be applied. I also
agree with Newey J’s view (expressed at para 47 of his judgment) that Mrs
Takhar’s application to set aside the judgment of Judge Purle has the potential
to meet the requirements which Aikens LJ outlined. She should not be fixed with
a further obligation to show that the fraud which she now alleges could not
have been discovered before the original trial by reasonable diligence on her
part.</a></p><a name="para57">

</span>An action to set aside an earlier judgment for fraud is not a procedural
application but a cause of action. As applied to judgments obtained by fraud,
the historical background was explained by Sir George Jessell MR in <i>Flower v
Lloyd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1877/173.html">(1877) 6 Ch D 297</a>, 299-300. Equity has always exercised a special
jurisdiction to reverse transactions procured by fraud. A party to earlier
litigation was entitled to bring an original bill in equity to set aside the
judgment given in that litigation on the ground that it was obtained by fraud.
Such a bill could be brought without leave, because it was brought in support
of a substantive right. If the fact and materiality of the fraud were
established, the party bringing the bill was absolutely entitled to have the
earlier judgment set aside. In this respect, an original bill differed from a
bill of review on the basis of further evidence, which was essentially
procedural and did require leave. After the fusion of law and equity in the
1870, the procedure by way of original bill was superseded by a procedure by
action on the same juridical basis.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cause of action to set aside a judgment in earlier proceedings for
fraud is independent of the cause of action asserted in the earlier
proceedings. It relates to the conduct of the earlier proceedings, and not to
the underlying dispute. There can therefore be no question of cause of action
estoppel. Nor can there be any question of issue estoppel, because the basis of
the action is that the decision of the issue in the earlier proceedings is
vitiated by the fraud and cannot bind the parties: <i>Director of Public
Prosecutions v Humphrys</i> [1977] AC 1, 21 (Viscount Dilhorne). If the
claimant establishes his right to have the earlier judgment set aside, it will
be of no further legal relevance qua judgment. It follows that res judicata
cannot therefore arise in either of its classic forms.</a></p><a name="para61">

</span>The rule, originally stated by Wigram V-C in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>
</a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>, 115, that a party is precluded from raising in subsequent
proceedings matters which were not, but could and should have been raised in
the earlier ones, is commonly treated as a branch of the law of res judicata.
It has the same policy objective and the same preclusive effect. But, it is
better analysed as part of the juridically distinct but overlapping principle
which empowers the court to restrain abuses of its process. The relationship
between the two concepts was examined by this court in <i>Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/46.html">[2014] AC 160</a>, paras 22-25. Whereas res
judicata is a rule of substantive law, abuse of process is a concept which
informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers. These are part of the
wider jurisdiction of the court to protect its process from wasteful and
potentially oppressive duplicative litigation even in cases where the relevant
question was not raised or decided on the earlier occasion. Since the decisions
of the House of Lords in <i>Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</i> [1991] 2
AC 93 and <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/65.html">[2002] 2 AC 1</a> it has been
recognised that where a question was not raised or decided in the earlier
proceedings but could have been, the jurisdiction to restrain abusive re-litigation
is subject to a degree of flexibility which reflects its procedural character.
This allows the court to give effect to the wider interests of justice raised
by the circumstances of each case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is this flexibility which supplies the sole juridical basis on which the
respondents can argue that the evidence of fraud must not only be new but such
as could not with reasonable diligence have been deployed in the earlier
proceedings. It is also the basis on which Lord Briggs, in his judgment on the
present appeal, suggests a less absolute rule than that proposed by Lord Kerr.
I cannot accept either the respondents’ argument, or Lord Briggs’ more moderate
variant of it. The reason is that proceedings of this kind are abusive only
where the point at issue and the evidence deployed in support of it not only could
have been raised in the earlier proceedings but should have been: see <i>Johnson
v Gore-Wood &amp; Co</i>, at p 31 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill) and <i>Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd</i>, para 22 (Lord Sumption). As
Lord Bingham observed in the former case, it is “wrong to hold that because a
matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as
to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.” The
“should” in this formulation refers to something which the law would expect a
reasonable person to do in his own interest and in that of the efficient
conduct of litigation. However, the basis on which the law unmakes
transactions, including judgments, which have been procured by fraud is that a
reasonable person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom he deals. He
is not expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing that other
persons are dishonest unless he knows that they are. That is why it is not a
defence to an action in deceit to say that the victim of the deceit was foolish
or negligent to allow himself to be taken in: <i>Central Railway Company of
Venezuela v Kisch</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1865/695.pdf">(1867) LR 2 HL 99</a>, 120 (Lord Chelmsford); <i>Redgrave v
Hurd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1881/251.html">(1881) 20 Ch D 1</a>, 13-17 (Jessell MR). It follows that unless on the
earlier occasion the claimant deliberately decided not to investigate a
suspected fraud or rely on a known one, it cannot be said that he “should” have
raised it.</p>

</span>Nor do I accept Lord Briggs’ view that a more flexible and
fact-sensitive approach may be required in order to distinguish between degrees
of dishonesty. I think that this would introduce an unacceptable element of
discretion into the enforcement of a substantive right. The standard of proof
for fraud is high, and rightly so. But once it is satisfied, there are no
degrees of fraud which can affect the right to have the judgment set aside.</a></p><a name="para64">

</span>Dicta apart, the only direct authority for a requirement that the new
evidence should be such as could not with reasonable diligence have been
deployed in the earlier proceedings is <i>McIlkenny v Chief Constable of the
West Midlands</i> [1980] 1 QB 283, affirmed sub nom. <i>Hunter v Chief
Constable of the West Midlands Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html">[1982] AC 529</a>. This was an action for
damages for assault committed in the course of a police investigation into the Birmingham
bombing of November 1974, which had ultimately led to the plaintiffs’
prosecution and conviction for murder. The same allegation of assault had been
made at the criminal trial as an objection to the admission of a confession.
The trial judge had rejected it on a voir dire. The subsequent civil action was
struck out as an abuse of process, because it was a collateral attack on the trial
judge’s ruling on the admissibility of the confession and thus on the
conviction. The actual decision is distinguishable on a number of counts. The
earlier proceedings were criminal. Moreover, the result of the civil action, if
it had succeeded, would have been to discredit a subsisting conviction without
setting it aside. The reasoning, however, is not so readily distinguishable. In
the Court of Appeal Goff LJ, at pp 333-335, relied on the authorities on
setting aside civil judgments for fraud. These supported the proposition that
decisive new evidence must be available in the later proceedings, but in
summarising them Goff LJ added a requirement, which they did not support, that
the evidence could not with reasonable diligence have been deployed in the
earlier proceedings. The sole authority for that refinement was Goff LJ
himself. His formulation of the test was endorsed by Lord Diplock, delivering
the only reasoned speech in the House of Lords, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html">[1982] AC 529</a>, 545. There are
dicta to the same effect in cases arising out of actions to set aside judgments
in civil proceedings: see Lord Bridge in <i>Owens Bank Ltd v Bracco</i> [1992]
2 AC 443, 483 and Lord Templeman in <i>Owens Bank Ltd v Etoile Commerciale SA</i>
[1995] 1 WLR 44, 48. It may well be that policy considerations justify such a
principle where a collateral attack is mounted on a criminal conviction
following a trial in which the same issue was decided. There are other
procedures for reopening unsafe criminal convictions in such cases. As is well
known, these were ultimately invoked and resulted in the convictions of the plaintiffs
and McIlkenny and Hunter being quashed. I would respectfully decline to treat
the statements in those cases as applying to proceedings to set aside a civil
judgment and would hold that the dicta in the two <i>Owens Bank</i> cases were
mistaken. None of these judicial statements sufficiently distinguishes between
(i) the proposition that an action to set aside a civil judgment must be based
on new evidence not before the court in the earlier proceedings, and (ii) the
proposition that that evidence must not have been obtainable by reasonable
diligence for the earlier proceedings. The first proposition is well
established. The second is not supported by any authority earlier than <i>McIlkenny</i>
and appears to me to be an insufficient answer to an allegation that a civil
judgment has been obtained against the claimant by the deliberate fraud of
another party. This is the effect of the decision of the High Court of
Australia in <i>McDonald v McDonald</i> (1965) 13 CLR 529, in which the two
propositions were carefully and separately considered. It was also the reason
why in <i>Toubia v Schwenke</i> (2002) NSWLR 46 the New South Wales Court of
Appeal observed that even in the absence of binding Australian authority they
would have regarded the dicta in the two <i>Owens Bank</i> cases as being
contrary to principle and declined to follow them. In my opinion the Australian
cases on this point are correct.</p>

</span>I would leave open the question whether the position as I have summarised
it is any different where the fraud was raised in the earlier proceedings but
unsuccessfully. My provisional view is that the position is the same, for the
same reasons. If decisive new evidence is deployed to establish the fraud, an
action to set aside the judgment will lie irrespective of whether it could
reasonably have been deployed on the earlier occasion unless a deliberate
decision was then taken not to investigate or rely on the material.</a></p><a name="para66">

</span>I recognise the risk of frivolous or extravagant litigation to set aside
judgments on the ground of fraud, but like other members of the court, I think
that the stringent conditions set out by Aikens LJ in <i>Royal Bank of Scotland
plc v Highland Financial Partners lp</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/328.html">[2013] 1 CLC 596</a>, para 106, combined
with the professional duties of counsel, are enough keep it within acceptable
limits. I do not think that the imposition of further conditions would be
consistent with the long-standing policy of equity of reversing transactions
procured by fraud.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">LORD BRIGGS:</span></b></p>

</span>This appeal turns on the outcome of a bare-knuckle fight between two
important and long-established principles of public policy. The first is that
fraud unravels all. The second is that there must come an end to litigation. I
will call them the fraud principle and the finality principle. On the facts of
this case I agree with Lord Kerr that the fraud principle should prevail. As
will appear I also agree with most of his reasoning. But I have been unable to
follow him all the way down a path which seeks to erect a reliable bright-line
boundary between types of case where one principle or the other should clearly
prevail. There will be too many cases where that supposed bright line is either
invisible, or so technical that it fails to afford a basis for choosing between
the two principles which accords with justice, common sense or the duty of the
court to retain control over its own process, and thereby protect it from
abuse. I would have preferred a more flexible basis upon which, recognising
that many cases will straddle any bright line, the court can apply a
fact-intensive evaluative approach to the question whether lack of diligence in
pursuing a case in fraud during the first proceedings ought to render a
particular claim to set aside the judgment in those proceedings for fraud an
abuse of process. This approach would in particular seek to weigh the gravity
of the alleged fraud against the seriousness of the lack of due diligence,
always mindful of the principle that victims of a fraud should not be deprived
of a remedy merely because they are careless.</a></p><a name="para68">

<p class="ParaHeading">The problems with a bright-line rule</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Basing himself on that obvious principle of justice, Lord Kerr proposes
a clear rule that a judgment may always be set aside for fraud without regard
either to the gravity of the fraud or to any lack of reasonable diligence by
the alleged victim, unless either (i) fraud was actually alleged in the earlier
proceedings, or (ii) there was a deliberate decision not to investigate a
suspected fraud. Only in those cases should the finality principle either
prevail, or at least give rise to a judicial discretion to apply it.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As will appear I agree that there should be such a power (although I
doubt whether discretion is the right word) in those two types of case, but
there will be numerous other types where the absence of any such power will in
my view be an unacceptable fetter upon the court’s duty to control its own
process, and to protect itself and the parties from abuse. The problems arise
mainly from the wide range in the gravity of the alleged frauds, the low
threshold of the summary judgment test which the fraud allegation must pass to
enable the allegation to be tried, and the almost infinite levels of
seriousness of the shortfall in the victim’s application of reasonable diligence.
It makes no sense to me either that a serious, pre-meditated, skilfully
executed and successful fraud should go without remedy merely because the
victim fell short of reasonable diligence by a narrow margin (as the rule
propounded by the Court of Appeal would ensure) or that something falling just
on the wrong side of honesty should expose the successful litigant to the full
rigour of a second trial, where the fraud allegation itself was only just
arguable, and the alleged victim was guilty of the most basic failure to test
the other party’s case (as I fear that Lord Kerr’s proposed rule would permit).</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The allegation of fraud in the present case is a telling example of a
grave fraud, at the most serious end of the range. I emphasise that it is at this
stage only an untested allegation. It is said that the Krishans planned and
implemented a clever forgery of a document vital (if genuine) to their case,
and that it was instrumental in their victory. By using a genuine signature of
Mrs Takhar, superimposing it on the joint venture agreement, disposing of the
original and using a copy to conceal the superimposition, they made it as hard
as they possibly could to prevent Mrs Takhar from dealing with it. On looking
at the copy document it appeared to her to be, and indeed it was, her
signature. Furthermore the alleged forgery was designed from the outset to
deceive not only Mrs Takhar but also the court, in litigation which must have
been pending when the forgery was planned and committed. By contrast the failure
in reasonable diligence may be said to have been at the less serious end of the
range. Although the relevant facts have not yet been investigated, it appears
likely that Mrs Takhar and her then legal team did take steps to investigate a
forgery which they suspected, but they left it too late.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A much more familiar example might go like this. Party A tells a spur of
the moment deliberate half-truth (ie a lie) about a fact in issue when cornered
during cross-examination at trial, and the advocate for party B fails to put it
to A that the statement was a lie (ie dishonest) rather than merely a mistaken
recollection, when there were disclosed documents which plainly justified
putting it as a lie, absent from the trial bundle due to a serious failure in
preparation for trial. Let it be supposed that the deliberate concealment of
the whole truth was just on the wrong side of honesty. The trial judge gives
credit to A’s evidence, in particular because the offending half-truth was not
challenged as a deliberate lie, and this materially contributed to A’s success.
A new legal team then does the necessary work on the disclosed documents and B
seeks to set aside the judgment for fraud. Neither of Lord Kerr’s exceptions
would apply. B would be able to seek a retrial of substantially the same case,
if successful in getting the judgment set aside. The court would be powerless
to stop the process as an abuse. Strictly B would be entitled to say that the
judgment had been obtained by fraud, but a retrial in such circumstances would
strike at the heart of the finality principle. On the other hand, if B’s
advocate had just said “that’s a lie Mr A”, the court would, on Lord Kerr’s analysis,
although not on Lord Sumption’s, have the requisite discretion because fraud
would have been put in issue at the trial.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest that, standing back from the legal technicalities, the
real reason why most reasonable observers would say that the application to set
aside the judgment in the first example should not be stayed as an abuse, but
that in the second example it should, is not because of the brief putting of
fraud in issue (if it had been) in the second, but because of the obvious
disparity between them, when weighing the gravity of the fraud against the
extent of the failure in due diligence. Both examples plainly engage both the
fraud and the finality principles. In both of them judgment is alleged to have
been obtained by fraud but, equally, in both examples the applicant is seeking,
as the overall objective, completely to re-litigate the first case, albeit as
the second stage in a two-stage process.</a></p><a name="para73">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The low level of the summary judgment threshold contributes to the
problem in this way. Applications to set aside a judgment for fraud present a
potential double whammy to the finality principle. Subject of course to
appeals, the first judgment should ordinarily be the end of the matter. But an
application to set it aside for fraud will itself involve a trial which,
because of the seriousness of the allegation, will be likely to be litigated
with bell, book and candle, no stone being left unturned. If the application
succeeds, there will then be a third trial, namely the re-trial of the original
claim. Of course the third trial will be avoided if the application to set
aside fails on the merits, but the only protection against the multiple
litigation constituted by the trial of the fraud allegation will be if it fails
to raise a triable issue.</a></p><a name="para74">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor therefore is it appropriate to address the extent to which the fraud
principle should prevail as against the finality principle on the basis that
the fraud has actually occurred. In particular cases the fraud allegation may
be a weak one, just passing the summary judgment test, whereas the invasion of
the finality principle in such a case will not merely be a risk but an
expensive and time-consuming actuality. If these considerations can be weighed
in an evaluative balance wherever the two principles are at loggerheads, well
and good, but they would only feature in the regime proposed by Lord Kerr if
one or the other of his two exceptions applied.</a></p><a name="para75">

<i>Highland Financial Partners lp</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/328.html">[2013] 1 CLC 596</a>, para 106, cited by Lord
Kerr, provide some protection against the abusive use of fraud allegations as a
way of re-opening decided cases. But they would be unlikely to prevent the AB
example from withstanding an application for defendant’s summary judgment. A
deliberate lie in the witness box is no less fraudulent because it is committed
on the spur of the moment. If it contributed materially to the outcome, then
the requirement for causation is likely to be satisfied, at least at the level
necessary to give rise to a triable issue. But those dicta are concerned with
delimiting the cause of action, not the varied circumstances in which its
pursuit may amount to an abuse.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77">77.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have already described by example the way in which there can be a wide
range of seriousness in a failure to conduct litigation with reasonable
diligence. An important part of the finality principle is that a party is
expected to bring his whole case about the relevant dispute to bear when it is
first litigated. That is the foundation of what used to be called the rule in <i>Henderson
v Henderson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>.<i> </i>If a matter relevant to a dispute
could have been raised in the earlier case, then it should have been, and to
litigate it even for the first time in a second case used automatically to be
prohibited. But the rigour and inflexibility of the old rule has been completely
transformed by its re-evaluation in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/65.html">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>. Now, even if the new matter could have been raised in the earlier
proceedings, it no longer follows that it necessarily should have been. Rather,
the court conducts an open-ended fact intensive evaluation of the question
whether to raise the new matter in a second claim is or is not an abuse. Lord
Bingham said, at p 31:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is, however, wrong to hold
that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should
have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily
abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion
be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private
interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case,
focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a
party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise
before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot
comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any
hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found
or not.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As will appear, although neither of those cases was
concerned with fraud, or with setting aside an earlier judgment, I consider
that the sea-change which was introduced by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v
Gore Wood </i>presents the correct way out of the problems thrown up by this
appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The authorities</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Like Lord Kerr I do not consider that these problems are satisfactorily
resolved by the existing authorities. My main reason is that the question
whether the making of a particular type of application to a court does or does
not involve an abuse of process is not one which is to be regarded as set in
stone for all time, once resolved (if it has been) by the highest court. The
abuse of process doctrine is one which both needs to be, and has conspicuously
been, adaptive to changes in litigation culture over time, during which the
pressures upon the courts and the readiness of the courts to conduct evaluative
assessments in place of the mechanical application of bright-line rules is
constantly changing. <i>Johnson v Gore Wood </i>is a prime but not sole example<i>
</i>of the courts’ capacity to adapt to changing circumstances, in an area
which is at least in part concerned with procedure.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event I agree with Lord Kerr, Lady Arden and Newey J that the
existing authorities do not upon analysis provide a reliable guide, even though
there are statements in some of them which, taken on their own, do appear to
suggest that it is settled law that a lack of reasonable diligence will always
be fatal to an application to set aside a judgment for fraud, as the Court of
Appeal held. They do not, either because the foundations of earlier authority
upon which they are expressed to be based prove upon minute analysis to be much
less clear than the later dicta which rely upon them suggest, or because there
are factors about the context in which the statements are made which are
clearly distinguishable from the present context. <i>Owens Bank v Etoile</i> is
an example of the first, while <i>Hunter v Chief Constable</i> is a clear
example of the second. To the extent that the English authorities do appear at
least superficially to espouse the rule that lack of reasonable diligence will
always defeat an application to set aside a judgment for fraud, they simply
fail to face up to the invasion thereby caused into the principle that a knave
should not escape liability because he is dealing with a fool, as powerfully
explained in the Australian and Canadian cases referred to by Lord Kerr.</a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is, therefore, an opportunity for this court to put upon a proper
modern basis the principles which ought to regulate the court’s power to give
full effect to the right of victims of fraud to obtain relief while at the same
time exercising an evaluative power to recognise the abuse of that right, and
to deal with it where it occurs. This would have enabled the courts to maintain
supervision of a type of claim which, if uncontrolled, could turn into a flood
of attempts by dissatisfied court users aimed at re-litigation of their
disputes, based upon merely arguable assertions that they lost because an
opposing party lied in the witness box, or even encouraged a witness to do so.</a></p><a name="para80">

<p class="ParaHeading">The principles</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point is clearly to recognise that the right to have a
judgment set aside for fraud is a distinct cause of action recognised by the
common law, like a right to set aside a contract obtained by fraud, which is
not inherently conditional upon any requirement for the exercise of reasonable
diligence in the proceedings leading to the impugned judgment or, for that
matter, the making of the impugned contract. In short, the exercise of
reasonable diligence is not in any way part of the cause of action. It is for
example fully applicable to a case in which judgment followed upon a defendant
simply letting the case go by default, if fraud was involved in the obtaining
of the judgment. It is a claim for relief obtainable as of right (ex debito
justitiae), rather than only by the invocation of a judicial discretion. Nor
does the right depend upon the seriousness of the fraud.</a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81"></a><a name="para82">82.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Two consequences flow from that starting point. The first is that, if no
allegation of fraud was made in the proceedings leading to the impugned
judgment, there is no question of cause of action or issue estoppel, for the
reasons given by Lord Kerr and Lord Sumption. The second is that the absence of
reasonable diligence is not of itself a reason for staying the claim to set
aside the judgment. This would be to deny relief to foolish victims of a knave,
merely because of their foolishness. The only reason to stay the application to
set aside is if the lack of reasonable diligence is so serious, in the context
of all other relevant factors, that the application can really be categorised
as abusive.</a></p><a name="para82">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But by contrast with claims to set aside agreements for fraud,
applications to set aside a judgment for fraud will usually engage the finality
principle, because of the re-litigation objective which normally lies at the
heart of them. Leaving aside default judgments (where there has as yet been
little real litigation), the objective of the applicant is not merely to have
the impugned judgment set aside, but also to clear the way to have the original
dispute relitigated. This may be thought to be obvious where the applicant is
(like Mrs Takhar) the unsuccessful claimant in the earlier case, but it is in
substance also true of a defendant’s application. Defendants will not of course
wish thereby to bring the same claim again, but their objective is to keep the
fraudulent claimant away from their door unless the claimant undertakes the
burden of a completely new case, all the way to trial.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is in my view no answer to this analysis to say that the application
to set aside a judgment for a fraud not previously alleged will not of itself
re-litigate anything, so that the finality principle is not thereby really
engaged at all. The overall objective is re-litigation. The forensic pursuit
and defence of the fraud allegation may well travel over, or at least overlap
with, ground trampled on in the original proceedings. The present case is an
obvious example, since the question whether Mrs Takhar made the agreement in
issue was central to the original trial, and would plainly be relevant to the
issue whether the document apparently recording the agreement was a forgery.
Even if it does not, the application will inevitably involve at least the risk
of further expensive and time-consuming proceedings about the entitlement of
the opposing party to relief already obtained by a judgment which, subject to
appeal, ought (in the public interest) to have put an end to the underlying
dispute. To that extent I respectfully disagree with the thrust of this part of
Lord Kerr’s analysis about the separateness of the original proceedings and the
application to set aside. In my view the contest between the fraud and finality
principles is inherent in applications of this kind, rather than only in Lord
Kerr’s two exceptions, where fraud was either alleged, or suspected but
deliberately not investigated, although it is of course present a fortiori in
such cases.</a></p><a name="para84">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84"></a><a name="para85">85.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That being so, it is in my view wrong in principle to say that the
generality of applications to set aside judgments for fraud are entirely
unaffected by questions about lack of reasonable diligence (or other factors
pointing towards abuse) subject only to the identification of specific
exceptional types where a judicial discretion may be engaged. The true
principle should be to recognise that such applications constitute the
assertion of a legal right with which the court will only interfere if
satisfied that the exercise of the right is abusive, but that all such
applications by their nature give rise to a risk of abuse with which the court
is duty bound to engage, because they undermine finality by their mere pursuit,
regardless of outcome. Re-litigation is always unfortunate, but it by no means
follows that the reason for it is an abuse of process by the applicant. It may
well be the respondent who is the real culprit.</a></p><a name="para85">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would not describe the court’s exercise of this duty to guard against
abuse as a discretion. There should be no judicial interference with the
exercise of the right to set aside a judgment for fraud unless the court is
satisfied that it involves an abuse of process. If it does, then the
proceedings should be stayed. That will not be discretionary, but it will involve
the evaluation of a potentially wide range of factors. I have already mentioned
the gravity of the fraud and the extent of the shortfall from the exercise of
reasonable diligence. Those would almost always be relevant. But the categories
of potentially relevant factors are in principle unlimited. They might include,
in particular cases, the centrality (or otherwise) of the fraudulent conduct to
the outcome of the case, the extent to which (as here) the alleged fraud was
specifically aimed at taking advantage of a lack of care in the preparation of
the case by the alleged victim, the resources of the alleged victim during the
first proceedings, the amount of toil, treasure and court time which would be
thrown away by the setting aside of the judgment, the amount of the same which
would be likely to be consumed by the trial of the fraud allegation and, if
successful, the re-trial of the original claim, and even the apparent strength
(or otherwise) of the allegation of fraud. But from start to finish, the
question is whether the application really is an abuse of process.</a></p><a name="para86">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor would I expect this evaluative approach frequently to come down in
favour of a stay. The principle that fraud unravels all is deeply rooted in the
common law, and its continued application is an important contributor to
honesty within society, to the rule of law and to the ability of the courts to
adjudicate disputes justly. Fraud of this kind is all the more serious because
it is aimed at deceiving the court itself. But the court must arm itself
against always having to allow re-litigation, and potentially two further
trials between the same parties, wherever the unsuccessful party wants to
allege, for the first time, that the case was lost because an opposing party
was lying about, rather than just mis-recalling, the facts in issue, and can
demonstrate an arguable case that this is what happened at trial.</a></p><a name="para87">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Sumption equates the setting aside a judgment for fraud with the
setting aside of any transaction for fraud on the basis that a reasonable
person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom he deals, and is not
expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing that other persons
are dishonest unless he knows that they are. I fully agree with that approach
to ordinary transactions out of court such as the making of a contract. But I
cannot agree that it is reasonable for a litigant always to assume that an
opponent’s case (and evidence in support of it) is honest, with a concomitant
right to conduct litigation on that basis, and to re-litigate the same dispute
whenever he can show, after judgment, an arguable case that his assumption was
wrong.</a></p><a name="para88">

<p class="ParaHeading">Application of the principles to this case</p>

</span>It will be apparent from the foregoing why I regard the present case as
lying very clearly on the non-abusive side of the line, without forming any
view at all about whether the allegation of this fraud will in fact be proved.
If proven it was a very serious, pre-meditated, carefully planned and executed
fraud which was instrumental in the defeat of Mrs Takhar’s claim, and plainly
aimed from start to finish at deceiving the court about the central issue in
the case. For the reasons given Mrs Takhar’s failure to use reasonable
diligence was by no means at the more serious end of the scale. The expert
evidence which she has now obtained, although thus far untested or opposed,
plainly gives her a real (rather than merely arguable) prospect of success. Her
application comes nowhere near being categorised as an abuse. I would therefore
allow the appeal.</a></p><a name="para89">

</span>This appeal concerns Mrs Takhar, who has brought an action (“a
rescission action”) to rescind a judgment against her and made available to the
court fresh evidence which, if proved at the trial of the rescission action,
will demonstrate that the winning party obtained judgment against her by fraud.
Preventing a person from prosecuting a rescission action in these circumstances
amounts to restricting her right to pursue her cause of action in fraud, and to
have access to justice for that cause of action. Therefore, the law should only
impose a restriction on such a claimant in a rescission action where there is
justification for doing so.</a></p><a name="para90">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Lord Kerr that there is no authority which binds this court
to hold that failure to act diligently in searching for this evidence before
the original trial is, of itself, a bar. It is easy to see how it came to be
thought that reasonable diligence in this regard had to be shown as in <i>Boswell
v Coaks (No 2)</i> (1894) 86 LT 356n (using the fuller report in the footnotes
to <i>Birch v Birch</i> (1902) 86 LT 364, which is also the report used by Lord
Templeman in the passage cited by Lord Kerr at para 40 above), the Earl of
Selborne, giving the judgment of the House of Lords, held obiter, having
emphasised the importance of the finality of judgments, that the rules which
applied to a bill of review before 1875 should continue to apply “in their full
force, and even with greater freedom than before”. Those rules included a
threshold condition in a rescission action that the fresh evidence “could not
possibly have been used when the decree was made” (see <i>Thomas v Rawlings</i>
(1865) 11 LT NS 721, 722, a decision of the Court of Appeal in Chancery).
Moreover, the Court of Appeal in <i>Birch v Birch</i> appears obiter to have
concluded that this earlier rule continued to apply (see (1902) 86 LT 367).
This may have been the reason why Goff LJ held in <i>McIlkenny v Chief
Constable of the West Midlands </i>[1980] QB 283, 335 that there was such a
rule. In the House of Lords, in the same case but under the name of <i>Hunter v
Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html">[1982] AC 529</a>, Lord Diplock
approved Goff LJ’s holding, but, as Lord Kerr has explained, in a different
context. Furthermore, it may be, as the Federal Court of Australia suggested in
<i>Monroe Schneider Associates Inc v No 1 Raberem Pty Ltd (No 2)</i> (1992) 37
FCR 234, 239, that prior to 1875 the Chancery Court had to be somewhat
circumspect when asked to rescind a judgment given in a common law court: this
might explain such threshold conditions.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92">92.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is only right that in the generality of cases a judgment obtained by
the fraud of the winning party should be rescinded because it is wrong in
principle that a person who is proved to be a fraudster should obtain and
retain the fruits of his fraud. Clearly, however, a restriction can be
justified in some special situations. In other words, there are occasionally
exceptions to the principle that “fraud unravels all”. There are cases where
both parties have colluded to deceive the court - in those cases it would be an
abuse of process to ask the court later to rescind the judgment. As Lord
Mansfield held in <i>Montefiori v Montefiori</i> (1762) 1 Black W 363, 96 ER
203 “no man shall set up his own iniquity as a defence, any more than as a
cause of action”.</a></p><a name="para92">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are other situations: for instance, where the fraud is not
material to the outcome: see, for example, <i>Boswell v Coaks</i>. Likewise, a
claim to set aside a decree absolute made on divorce, which is equivalent to an
order in rem, was not set aside in <i>Callaghan v Hanson-Fox</i> [1992] Fam 1
because the parties knew about the evidence and its significance. There must be
actual fraud: constructive fraud is not enough. The fraud must be one for which
the defendant is responsible. There may well be other situations which I have
not mentioned. There may for instance (I express no view) be exceptions where
the judgment in the original action was obtained by perjury during the trial or
where the fraud was in fact pleaded in the first action.</a></p><a name="para93">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Greater difficulty lies in situations where at the time of the original
action a party suspects a fraud but does not investigate it or decides not to
investigate it. The justice in this situation may not be so easily answered by
allowing an unfettered right to bring a rescission action. I would treat this
as a case where the <i>Ashingdane </i>principles found in the jurisprudence of
the European Court of Human Rights apply (see <i>Ashingdane v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1985/8.html">(1985) 7 EHRR 528</a>). Any restriction would have to be derived from a rule which serves
the legitimate aim of proving a just solution, thus striking a fair balance
between the relevant considerations and going no further than necessary, and
which does not defeat the core right of access to court.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95">95.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are factors which favour some restriction on the victim’s right in
this situation. The judgment in the original action will be final and
conclusive (subject to any appeal, and it is to be noted that on any appeal
lack of reasonable diligence in obtaining the new evidence for the trial would
be relevant). Finality in judgments leads to certainty, and hopefully to the
social benefits of dispute resolution. Where property is in issue (eg the
ownership of a business), the owner following a final judgment can develop it,
invest in it and use it as security to raise money to develop other businesses
free from the risk that it might be claimed by someone else. That also is for
the economic and social benefit of the community, and there is a social and
economic cost if that process is delayed.</a></p><a name="para95">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, a litigant has plenty of opportunities to challenge the
other party’s case under the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”). Mrs Takhar could
have served notice on the respondents to prove the disputed agreement, sought
further information about it from the respondents and appealed from the denial
of permission to adduce expert handwriting evidence. A party is expected to
co-operate with the court and the other parties in ensuring that so far as possible
all issues are dealt with efficiently at a single trial. Under the overriding
objective in CPR rule 1.1(1), the court must deal with cases just and
proportionately and this includes allotting to each case “an appropriate share
of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources
to other cases”. Litigation resulting in rescission actions may involve not
just one but three actions in all. There is also always the risk that the
defendant if successful will incur costs which he cannot recover. In assessing
reasonable diligence, however, it must be recalled that some litigants do not
have legal representation and also that a party is entitled to conduct herself
on the basis that the other side is not fraudulent, and that no investigations
are needed, until she has real grounds for suspecting fraud.</a></p><a name="para96">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para96"></a><a name="para97">97.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is of course important for the efficient despatch of litigation that
a court insists on compliance with its procedural rules: failure to do so in
appropriate cases would provide an incentive to non-compliance.</a></p><a name="para97">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97"></a><a name="para98">98.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The rule in contention on this appeal, however, held by the Court of
Appeal to be derived from case law, selects just one consideration - and one
based on the victim’s conduct. It is illogical to the extent that it
automatically imposes a sanction (a ban on bringing the second action) that may
be wholly disproportionate to the lack of diligence. Moreover, it would leave
all other factors out of account, including the defendant’s allegedly
fraudulent conduct. In any event, a restriction on a person pursuing a cause of
action should in principle only be imposed where it is necessary to do so to
protect the rights and freedoms of others.</a></p><a name="para98">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para98"></a><a name="para99">99.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addition, such a rule would take no account of the protections that
can be provided to the defendant in appropriate cases by the exercise of other
procedural powers, such as the power to strike out actions which had no real
prospect of success. Where the defendant to the rescission action considers
that it is clearly not well-founded, he can apply to strike out the action on
the grounds of abuse of process or obtain summary judgment in his favour. He
can be protected in costs and also by the strict rule of procedure that a fraud
must be particularised with exactitude: see <i>Jonesco v Beard</i> [1930] AC 298.</a></p><a name="para99">

</span>Where the defendant is prejudiced, and his position cannot for some
reason be safeguarded, or the rights of innocent third parties have intervened,
it may be relevant to take into account any remedies that the victim may have
against her professional advisers in the original action. Where innocent third
parties have obtained rights, there may indeed be no point in rescission of the
original judgment and the victim may have to resort to other remedies.</a></p><a name="para100">

</span>Too robust a rule favouring finality might encourage litigants to
attempt to deceive the other parties or the court. Where deceit is practised on
the court, the integrity of the legal system is put at risk and that is an
important consideration against the rule contended for.</a></p><a name="para101">

</span>But the short point is that there is as of now at least no procedural
rule about any restriction on a person bringing a rescission action in the CPR.
The drafters of those rules may wish to consider whether the position should be
changed following these judgments. The jurisprudence of the courts of Australia
and Canada cited by Lord Kerr is instructive. It is worth noting that in <i>Clone
Pty Ltd v Players Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (Receivers &amp; Managers Appointed)</i>
[2018] HCA 12 the High Court of Australia was only dealing with lack of reasonable
diligence before the fraud was discovered, but the position reached in these
cases is not universal in common law jurisdictions. For instance, a rule
requiring the claimant in the rescission action to show that he made a
“reasonable effort in the original trial to ascertain the truth of the matter”
can be found in the <i>Restatement of Judgments (Second)</i> (1982), para 70
(American Law Institute). There is also legislative precedent for the loss of a
right of action as a result of a failure to exercise reasonable diligence in
discovering fraud in Limitation Act 1980, section 32.</a></p><a name="para102">

</span>It might be salutary if the CPR were to require a party bringing a
rescission action to provide an explanation as to his state of knowledge at the
time of the first action in his pleading in the second action, or if they
enabled the court to award some security for costs or impose other conditions
if reasonable diligence was not taken in the first action. I agree with much
that Lord Sumption has said in his judgment, but the question whether
conditions should be imposed in this context may involve considerations apart
from the imperative of reopening judgments procured by fraud and fall well
short of preventing actions for that purpose being brought. The Civil Procedure
Rule Committee is empowered to introduce changes to the CPR, and importantly
the process involves consultation.</a></p><a name="para103">

</span>The statement of principles set out by Aikens LJ in <i>Royal Bank of
Scotland plc v</i> <i>Highland Financial Partners lp</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/328.html">[2013] 1 CLC 596</a> at
para 106 approved by Lord Kerr deals with the position at the trial of a
rescission action, not with threshold conditions on bringing such an action.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para105">105.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of any special provision in the CPR, and assuming the
claim is properly pleaded, the only remedy available to the defendant in a
rescission action is to apply to the court for an order barring the claim as an
abuse of process. It must be a matter for the respondents in this case whether
to pursue that course. They may wish to bring an application or even to contend
that some exception to the general rule which this court has found applies.
There are matters which cause me some concern on the limited evidence before
this court: the fact that Mrs Takhar had concerns about the authenticity of her
signature on the agreement from 2008 (two years before the trial), the fact
that she had no other explanation in the original trial for the fact that the
agreement appeared to bear her signature, her failure to challenge the
authenticity of the agreement or to appeal the judge’s order denying permission
to adduce handwriting evidence, the fact that she has received a settlement
already from her solicitors suggesting that there was a lack of reasonable
diligence (and clearly it cannot matter that it was the solicitors and not the
client who showed lack of diligence), and the fact that two years passed
between obtaining the report of the handwriting expert and bringing these
proceedings.</a></p><a name="para105">

</span>I do not consider that it is for this court to determine the precise
state of knowledge at any time of Mrs Takhar or those representing her. It is
enough to say that in my judgment, there is not, and should not be, a rule that
want of reasonable diligence in the first action of itself leads to a blanket
ban on bringing an action to rescind a judgment which the claimant can properly
allege the respondents obtained by fraud. This appeal should be allowed and the
order of Newey J restored.</a></p><a name="para106">
