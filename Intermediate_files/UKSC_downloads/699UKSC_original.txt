The directive was required to be transposed into domestic law by 7 April 2000.</a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are four judges, each of whom has held one or more appointments as fee-paid part-time judges, in some cases moving between such part-time and full-time salaried appointments. They are illustrative of the different ways in which such part-time (PT) and full-time (FT) appointments may be combined in a single career, as Mr Allen QC (for the appellants) explains in his printed case:</a></p><a name="para2"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The careers of Mr Haworth and Mr Sprack illustrate the common situation of a judge moving from PT to FT in the same jurisdictions: Mr Haworth as a Costs Judge, and Mr Sprack as an Employment Judge. Mr Sprack also reverted to working PT before finally retiring.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The careers of Mr Fox and Mr Wain illustrate the kinds of judicial careers that are based on a portfolio of PT judicial appointments which can change over time prior to retirement. Additionally, Mr Wain also held a FT appointment as a District Judge between May 2004 and January 2011, though even then he also held a PT appointment as a Mental Health Tribunal judge.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each appellant lodged a claim with the Employment Tribunal more than three months after the end of a part­time appointment, and therefore out of time if that is the relevant date; but within time, if the relevant date is the date of retirement. In a decision given on 2 January 2014 EJ Macmillan held that the period of three months started to run from the end of any part-time appointment, and that the claims were accordingly out of time. He declined to exercise the discretion (under PTWR para 8(3)) to extend time as being “just and equitable”; that part of his decision is no longer in issue. Since then there has been no substantive judicial consideration of these issues at higher levels, the issues being treated as in substance turning on decisions, domestic and European, in the related case of <i>O’Brien v Ministry of Justice </i>(see below).</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Domestic legislation provides for the payment of judicial pensions under two statutes, the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 and the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993. The 1981 Act applies to persons appointed prior to 31 March 1995, unless they elect to have their pension paid under the 1993 Act. The 1993 Act applies to persons appointed on or after 31 March 1995. Under the Acts, a pension is payable to any person retiring from ‘qualifying judicial office’, subject to their having attained the age of 65 and, under the 1993 Act, subject also to their having completed at least five years’ service in such office. At the material time, full-time judges and salaried part-time judges held a qualifying judicial office, but fee-paid part-time judges, such as recorders, did not. Under both schemes, the amount of pension payable to a full-time judge is based on his or her final year’s salary and on his or her number of years’ service in a qualifying judicial office by the date of retirement. Under the 1981 Act, circuit judges must have served for 15 years in order to qualify for a full pension of one half of their last annual salary. The corresponding period under the 1993 Act is 20 years. Under both schemes, judges who have served for shorter periods receive a proportion of the full pension corresponding to the length of their service. There is also a lump sum payable on retirement, the sum being based on the amount of the annual pension. Judicial pensions were at the material time non-contributory. Since 2012, judges have had to pay a contribution.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the provisions of the 1993 Act, which applied to those appointed on or after 31 March 1995. The basic concept in the 1993 Act is “qualifying judicial office” (1993 Act section 1(1)). By section 1(6):</a></p><a name="para5"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be regarded as holding, or serving in, qualifying judicial office at any time when he holds, on a salaried basis, any one or more of the offices specified in Schedule 1 to this Act; …”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1">Schedule 1 is a list of offices ranging from court judges at different levels, through “court officers” (such as Queen Bench Masters), to “members of tribunals” in a range of specified jurisdictions. It is to be noted that the focus (under section 1(6)) is not on individual offices or appointments, but on “qualifying judicial office” - a composite term which may comprise any one or more of the listed offices.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Any person to whom this Part applies -</p>

Although his terms of service gave no right to a pension, he claimed to be entitled under the PTWR to a pension on terms equivalent to those applying to a circuit judge. Following a reference to the CJEU, in February 2013 his claim in principle was upheld by the Supreme Court (<i>O’Brien v Ministry of Justice </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] UKSC 6</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] 1 WLR 522</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] ICR 499</a>).</p>

The question was whether, in calculating the amount of his pension, account should be taken of the whole of his service since the beginning of his appointment on 1 March 1978 (a period of 27 years), or only his service since the deadline for transposing the directive expired (a period of less than five years). Following conflicting decisions of the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal, on 6 October 2015 the Court of Appeal held that only the shorter period should be taken into account (<i>O’Brien v Ministry of Justice</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1000.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 1000</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1000.html">[2016] ICR 182</a>).

In his judgment explaining the reference, Lord Reed (paras 15-20) cited <i>Ten Oever v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds voor het Glazenwassers en Schoonmaakbedrijf</i> (Case C-109/91) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1993/C10991.html">[1995] ICR 74</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1993/C10991.html">[1993] ECR I-4879</a>) (“<i>Ten Oever</i>”), as showing that the CJEU had treated occupational pensions “as a form of pay, the entitlement to which accrues over the length of the employee’s service.” Mr O’Brien had argued that, consistently with the future effects principle, earlier periods of employment were to be taken into account when applying the directive in situations which arose after it should have been transposed. In contrast the Ministry had argued that, since (under <i>Ten Oever</i>) the entitlement to an occupational pension accrued at the time of the work, his non-entitlement to pension in respect of his first 22 years of service must, in line with the non-retroactivity principle, be left out of account having been definitively established before the directive entered into force.</p>

The CJEU, in effect upholding the majority view, held that periods of service prior to the deadline for transposing the directive must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the retirement pension entitlement. As the court explained, while a new legal rule does not apply to legal situations that “arose and became definitive” prior to its entry into force, it does apply to “the future effects of a situation which arose under the old law” (para 27). It was accordingly necessary to examine whether -</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the gradual acquisition of pension entitlements over the period preceding the deadline [for transposition of the directive] has the effect that the legal situation of the claimant must be considered to have become definitive at that date.” (para 29)</p>

However, (in a passage relied on by both parties in the present appeal) the court observed:</a></p><a name="para14"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para14">“… with regard to the argument of the United Kingdom Government that the calculation of the period of service required to qualify for a retirement pension should be distinguished from the rights to a pension, </a><a name="_Hlk24960565">it must be noted that it cannot be concluded from the fact that a right to a pension is definitively acquired at the end of a corresponding period of service that the legal situation of the worker must be considered definitive.

The issue in <i>Walker</i> in short was whether the civil partner of Mr Walker (under a partnership registered in January 2006) was entitled to be paid a survivor’s pension calculated by reference to Mr Walker’s service, both before and after the transposition date of Directive 2000/78/EC (the Framework Equality Directive), which outlawed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Consistently with its view in <i>O’Brien</i>, applying the <i>Ten Oever </i>principle, the Court of Appeal had held that only Mr Walker’s service after the transposition date (2 December 2003) should be taken into account in calculating the survivor’s pension to which his partner would be entitled.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Mr Chamberlain [counsel for Mr Walker] submitted that the appeal tribunal … wrongly took Advocate General Van Gerven’s description of pension benefits in the <i>Ten Oever</i> case … as ‘deferred pay’ as equating the time at which a pension right accrues with the time at which any discrimination in the provision of resulting benefits is to be judged. I agree that the appeal tribunal was wrong to do so. <i>The point of unequal treatment occurs at the time that the pension falls to be paid</i>. If Mr Walker married a woman long after his retirement, she would be entitled to a spouse’s pension, notwithstanding the fact that they were not married during the time that he was paying contributions to his pension fund. Whether benefits referable to those contributions are to be regarded as ‘deferred pay’ is neither here nor there, so far as entitlement to pension is concerned. Mr Walker was entitled to have for his married partner a spouse’s pension at the time he contracted a legal marriage. The period during which he acquired that entitlement had nothing whatever to do with its fulfilment.” (para 56, emphasis added)</p>

It is sufficient to quote the most relevant part of his conclusion:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore reach the same conclusion as the tribunal in <i>O’Brien</i>, namely that the act of discrimination complained of, denial of access to the scheme while a fee paid judge, must be distinguished from the consequences of that act, the failure to pay a pension reflecting fee paid service, a passage expressly approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>O’Brien</i>. <i>Barclays Bank plc v Kapur</i>, in my judgment, far from being a trump card is in fact irrelevant.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is true of the simple transfer cases it must, in my judgment be true of the so-called portfolio cases, that is those cases where at some point in their career a fee paid judge has held other fee paid offices which they no longer hold at the time the claim was presented. Time runs in those cases from the date on which each office was relinquished. The variants of the simple transfer case, where the salaried judge returns to fee paid office on retirement from the salaried post and where the fee paid judge continues to hold a fee paid office in addition to their salaried office, produce the same result although for different reasons. In the former case Mr Allen has failed to explain how, if the first period of fee paid service is out of time, the second period somehow resurrects the corpse. He has failed to explain it because no explanation is available. In the latter case the answer lies in regulations 5(1) and 8(4)(a).

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The answer to the question whether [the Miller appellants’] claims are in time depends on the point in time at which pension rights are definitively acquired and time for bringing a claim starts to run.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In <i>O’Brien 2</i> (para 35) the CJEU confirmed that the right to a pension is “definitively acquired” at the end of the corresponding period of service.

Under domestic legal principles, pensions are treated as deferred pay (<i>Parry v Cleaver</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/2.html">[1970] AC 1</a> at 16C-D), the entitlement to which accrues at the time of service. The fact that the pay is received some time after employment has ended, so that the consequences may not be felt for some time afterwards, does not detract from the position that the less favourable treatment or detriment took place during the service. A distinction is to be drawn between the less favourable treatment or detriment and its consequences (<i>Barclays Bank plc v Kapur</i> [1989] ICR 753, 770 per Mann LJ). This is illustrated by <i>Sougrin v Haringey Health Authority</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/1991/586_90_3107.html">[1992] ICR 650</a>, in which it was held that time ran from the alleged act of discrimination (the refusal to promote the claimant), not from the subsequent period during which she received a lower salary in consequence.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He submits further that to hold that the relevant date does not arise until the pension is taken would lead to absurd consequences:</a></p><a name="para26"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It would mean that a claimant in a pensions case would have no right to take proceedings under the PTWR until they had reached pension age which may be very many years after the period of service and which may well be too late to obtain a genuine remedy. It would also mean that the very many claims that have been brought by claimants in the judicial pensions litigation who are below retirement age would have to be struck out on the basis that there has been as yet no breach of the PTWR.”</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The appellants</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Allen for the appellants reads regulation 8 as posing the question: when did the less favourable treatment allegedly unlawful contrary to regulation 5 <i>finally</i> occur? (his emphasis). The Ministry’s arguments fail to give weight to the true nature of their claims. The treatment which is less favourable, compared to that afforded to a full-time judge, is the non-payment of a pension pro rata temporis on retirement at or above 65. The detriment finally occurs at the point at which, had they only ever worked full-time in qualifying judicial office, they would have been actually entitled to a pension:</a></p><a name="para27"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Until then the pension entitlement of the comparator is, prospective, contingent and inchoate in the sense of not being fully formed. Until then their right to equal treatment is similarly prospective, contingent and inchoate.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach is, he submits, entirely consistent with para 35 of the CJEU’s judgment in <i>O’Brien 2</i> (see above). Although the court spoke of the right being “definitively acquired” at the end of a period of service, it recognised that this was not “definitive” of the worker’s legal situation, since it was “only subsequently and by taking into account relevant periods of service” that he could “effectively avail himself of that right” with a view to payment of his retirement pension.</a></p><a name="para28"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The passage of Lord Griffiths’ speech in <i>Kapur</i> does not assist Mr Cavanagh, both because the wording of the relevant provision was different, but also because the House was not asked to consider whether or not there was relevant unfavourable treatment also at the time of retirement. Conversely, his argument disregards the clear and specific treatment of this issue by Lord Kerr in <i>Walker</i>. Nor is there any basis for the suggested absurdity arising from the appellants’ argument. The fact that there is relevant detriment at the time of retirement does not mean that there is no detriment at an earlier period, nor that there is anything to prevent proceedings in that respect at an earlier stage.</a></p><a name="para29"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I understand it, it is now common ground that the issue in this appeal is one of domestic law, turning on the construction and application of regulation 8 of the PTWR, and that the determinative question is: when did the less favourable treatment occur, or (in Mr Allen’s words) when did it <i>finally</i> occur? Although perhaps understandable at the time, the former assumption (apparent in the judgment of the Court of Appeal) that the issue was one of European Law, and that the present claims would stand or fall with <i>O’Brien</i>, seems to have proved something of an impediment to a clear analysis of the relevant issues of domestic law.</a></p><a name="para30"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time it must be borne in mind that that the regulations have to be construed in a highly artificial context. That results not only from the need to conform to the requirements of European law, but also from the special characteristics of judicial appointments and judicial pensions under domestic law. In the first place, while the regulations assume the existence of a “contract” of employment (see regulation 5, 8(4)), a judicial officer is not employed under a contract (see <i>Gilham v Ministry of Justice (Protect intervening) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/44.html">[2019] UKSC 44</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/44.html">[2019] 1 WLR 5905</a>), so that references to the “terms of a contract” can at best be applied by analogy. Secondly, as has been seen, the judicial pension scheme is not based on individual appointments, but on “qualifying judicial office”, which may include a number of different appointments within those specified in Schedule 1 of the 1993 Act.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That special feature of the scheme needs to be taken into account in making a comparison for the purposes of the regulations. It may be misleading and unfair to direct attention to the nature and timing of individual part-time appointments, without regard to the broader concept of “qualifying judicial office”, which would have applied had they been brought within the statutory scheme. This as I understand it was a point made by Mr Allen in the Employment Tribunal, as recorded by Judge Macmillan (ET para 12):</a></p><a name="para32"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 permits the payment of pension only on retirement from judicial office, not from ‘a’ judicial office and requires the judge’s pension to be calculated on their aggregated service in judicial office, meaning that the judge who changes roles has her total service counted for pension purposes, not just her service in the latest role. The European cases relied upon by Mr Cavanagh are simply not in point as they do not deal with time limit issues at all.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As has been seen (para 19 above), the judge took a narrower view. He proceeded on the basis that, in what he called a “simple transfer case” -</a></p><a name="para33"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“time therefore runs from the date on which the fee paid office about which complaint is made, ended.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1">He applied the same approach to more complex “portfolio” cases where a fee-paid judge has held other fee-paid offices, or has moved between salaried and fee-paid offices: time runs “from the date on which each office was relinquished”. I understand the logic of that approach. But, as Mr Allen submitted, it does not fit well with the aggregate approach required by the 1993 Act. The varied combinations of fee-paid or salaried offices undertaken by different individuals were a desirable feature of a flexible judicial system, but there is no reason why they should govern the entitlement to pension, under the PTWR any more than under the 1993 Act itself.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Mr Allen that the speech of Lord Griffiths in <i>Kapur </i>is not determinative. The issue was whether the unfavourable treatment continued throughout the period of employment. The House was not required to consider whether there was an unfavourable treatment also at the point when the pension was or would be taken. For the same reason, I would reject Mr Cavanagh’s submission as to the “absurd” consequences which would follow from denying complainants a remedy at an earlier stage. As regulation 5 makes clear, the unfavourable treatment may relate to the terms of the contract, or “any other detriment” resulting from an act or failure to act by the employer. By analogy, in the context of judicial pensions, the part-time judge may properly complain both during his period of service, that his terms of office did not include provision for a future pension; and, at the point of retirement, that there has been a failure at that point to make a pension available. The former does not exclude the latter.</a></p><a name="para34"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I agree with Mr Allen that Lord Kerr’s judgment in <i>Walker </i>is helpful in that respect. Although he was not concerned with the application of a comparable time limit, that does not detract from the generality of his statement that “the point of unequal treatment occurs at the time that the pension falls to be paid”. It is consistent also with Lord Reed’s statement in <i>O’Brien </i>that “it is unlawful to discriminate against part-time workers when a retirement pension falls due for payment”. In my view, that also accords with the common sense of the matter. It may be that the appellants could have complained of less favourable treatment, as compared to their full-time colleagues, by reference to the lack of any equivalent provision for a pension in their terms of office. But that does not detract in any way from the less favourable treatment they undoubtedly suffered, or would suffer, at the point of retirement.</a></p><a name="para35">
