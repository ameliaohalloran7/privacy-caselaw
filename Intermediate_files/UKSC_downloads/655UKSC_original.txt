</span>Supplies of education to students in the United Kingdom are exempt from
value added tax (“VAT”) if they are made by a college of a university within
the meaning of Note 1(b) to Item 1, Group 6 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994

</span>In these proceedings the appellant (“SEL”) contends that its supplies of
education to students in the United Kingdom were and are exempt from VAT
because it was and remains a college of Middlesex University (“MU”). For this
reason, it appealed against assessments raised by the Commissioners for Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“the Commissioners”) in respect of its
accounting periods 1 May 2009 to 29 February 2012. It has also appealed against
subsequent assessments, but these have been stayed by agreement with the
Commissioners pending the outcome of this appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>SEL’s appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal (the “FTT”, Judge
John Clark and Dr Michael James MBE) by its decision dated 28 February 2014:
TC/2011/022521, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKFTT/TC/2014/TC03358.html">[2014] UKFTT 218 (TC)</a>. The Commissioners appealed that decision to the Upper Tribunal
(the “UT”, Judge Colin Bishopp and Judge Guy Brannan) which allowed the appeal
by its decision dated 25 April 2016: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2016/193.html">[2016] UKUT 193 (TCC)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2016/193.html">[2016] STC 1837</a>.
SEL then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard over three days

</span>SEL now appeals to this court. In broad terms the appeal gives rise to
the following questions: first, whether the Court of Appeal adopted the correct
approach in determining whether SEL was a college of MU for the purposes of
Note 1(b) to Item 1, Group 6 of the VAT Act; and secondly, if it did not,
whether, upon application of the correct test, SEL was such a college.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>SEL is an English company and a subsidiary of SAE Technology Group BV, a
Dutch company. Both are part of the SAE group of companies which trades around
the world under the name “SAE Institute” (“SAEI”). SAE is an acronym for
“School of Audio Engineering” and SAEI has for many years provided education in
audio and digital media technologies, and as a result has gained a significant
reputation in that field. SAEI has conducted business in the United Kingdom
since 1985, first through SAE Educational Trust Ltd (“SETL”) and, since 1 May
2009, through SEL. From that date SEL has taught in the United Kingdom the
higher education courses to which I shall come in a moment.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>MU is a United Kingdom university within the meaning of the VAT Act,
Group 6, Item 1, Note 1(b). It has never had any financial interest in any SAE
group company, and no MU employee has ever been a director of any such company.
Similarly, no SAE group company has had a representative on MU’s governing body
or has played any direct part in its governance. Nevertheless, the relationship
between MU and SAEI has been very close and is a reflection of a series of
agreements addressing the nature of that relationship, the validation by MU of
SAEI programmes of education and the accreditation of SAE group companies.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As early as 1998 SAEI and MU agreed a memorandum of cooperation which
provided for the teaching by “SAE Technology College” of Bachelor of Arts
(“BA”) degree courses in Recording and Multimedia Arts at specified campuses.
These courses were described as “validated collaborative programmes” of MU.
Overall responsibility for the courses was retained by MU but their day-to-day
direction was undertaken by employees of an SAEI group company. Over the years
that followed this memorandum was superseded by other memoranda of cooperation
and the validation of BA degree courses in Multimedia, Interactive Animation
and Games Programming. In 2009 another memorandum of cooperation was agreed
which consolidated into a single framework the programmes which had by that
time been validated by earlier memoranda. It set out the terms on which MU
agreed to validate specified courses and how entry requirements were to be set
and satisfied. In short, admission requirements would be set by SAEI but
conform to MU’s general requirements; students who met those requirements would
be selected by SAEI using procedures agreed by MU; selected students would be
enrolled by SAEI for one of MU’s qualifications; enrolled students would be considered
members of MU and taught by SAEI subject to MU’s quality safeguards; and in due
course those enrolled students would be assessed by SAEI subject to MU’s
regulations and, if they completed their programmes of study successfully,
would be awarded a degree by MU.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>From time to time SAEI and MU also entered into what have been termed
partnership agreements which made more general provision relating to the
relationship between them. The first such agreement, entered into in 2003,
recorded the intention of the parties to work together to develop undergraduate
and taught graduate degree courses at SAEI centres in the United Kingdom and
around the world. It was intended at that time that within five years MU would
consider an application from SAEI for MU accreditation which would allow SAEI
to validate for itself courses leading to the award of undergraduate degrees by
MU. In 2009 SAEI and MU entered into another partnership agreement which
recorded that within 12 months MU would consider an application from SAEI for
such accreditation. To this end, it was agreed that senior executives of MU and
SAEI would meet three times a year to develop their collaboration on
undergraduate and postgraduate courses of study.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>In September 2010 SAEI was accredited by MU to validate, provide,
monitor and review courses of study leading to MU BA degrees in Recording Arts,
Film Making, Digital Film Animation and Multimedia Arts. The instrument of
accreditation permitted SAEI to conduct MU graduation ceremonies but graduating
students could also attend a graduation ceremony at MU if they so wished. A
memorandum of cooperation confirmed the independent status of SAEI and allowed
it to retain its own governing council and academic board and responsibility
for its own financial management.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>In July 2011 MU and SAEI entered into what was described as a Special
Associate College Agreement (“SACA”). This recorded their successful
cooperation over 14 years in the provision of courses of education, including
courses leading to MU undergraduate and graduate awards. It provided, by clause
2:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="ParaHeading">The legal framework</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The origin of the common system for the collection of VAT in the
European Union lies in the First Council Directive 67/227/EC of 11 April 1967
on the harmonisation of legislation of member states concerning turnover taxes
(“the First Directive”). This recognised the interest of the common market in
achieving a harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes so as to
eliminate, so far as possible, factors which might distort competition, and it
provided, in article 2, that the principle of the common system involved the
application to goods and services of a general tax on consumption which was
proportional to their price.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC, also of 11 April 1967, on the
harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes and procedures for
application of the common system of VAT (“the Second Directive”) made further
provision for harmonisation and recorded in its fifth recital that the
introduction of zero rates of tax gave rise to difficulties and it was highly
desirable to limit strictly the number of exemptions. However, article 10 of
the Second Directive exempted from VAT in any member state the supply of goods
to places outside the territory of that state and the provision of services
relating to such goods or goods in transit, and, of particular relevance to
this appeal, also provided that, subject to consultation, any member state
could determine the other exemptions it considered necessary.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>The First and Second Directives were followed by the Sixth Council
Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of member
states relating to turnover taxes (“the Sixth Directive”). This recited the
need for a common system of exemptions and, in Title X, article 13, part A,
made express provision for the exemption of certain activities in the public
interest, including the supply of services related to education. Article 13A(1)
provided, so far as material:</a></p><a name="para13">

the legislative scheme as being to harmonise legislation on turnover taxes and

It is therefore necessary to achieve such harmonisation of legislation on
turnover taxes by means of a system of value added tax (VAT), such as will
eliminate, as far as possible, factors which may distort conditions of
competition, whether at national or Community level.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Title IX sets out various exemptions, including the exemption concerning
the provision of university education first introduced in the Sixth Directive
in the manner I have described. Article 131 of Chapter 1 of Title IX provides:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The exemptions provided for in

</span>These provisions of the Principal VAT Directive and the general scheme
of which they form a part were considered by the Court of Justice of the European
Union (the “CJEU”) in <i>Minister Finansów v MDDP sp z oo Akademia Biznesu, sp
komandytowa,</i> (Case C-319/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C31912.html">[2014] STC 699</a>. MDDP, a Polish undertaking,
carried on the business of organising for profit specialised training courses
and applied to the Polish Minister for Finance for confirmation that it was
entitled to deduct input VAT levied on the goods and services it needed for its
business. The Minister refused to provide that confirmation and so MDDP issued
proceedings in which it claimed that its activities should not be exempt from
VAT but subject to it, and that Polish law, which provided that such activities
were exempt, was incompatible with the Principal VAT Directive. A reference by
the Polish court to the CJEU asked, in substance, whether articles 132(1), and
133 of the Principal VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that
educational services provided for commercial purposes not governed by public
law were precluded from exemption from VAT.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addressing that question, the CJEU explained (at paras 33 to 36) that
articles 132(1)(i) and 133 do not preclude educational services provided for
commercial purposes by bodies not governed by public law from being exempt from
VAT; however, under article 132(1)(i), supplies of educational services are
exempt only if they are provided by bodies governed by public law or by other
organisations recognised by the member state concerned as having similar
objects. It followed that the exemption in issue, which applied generally to
all supplies of educational services, whatever the aim pursued by the private
organisations providing those services, was incompatible with article
132(1)(i).</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>The CJEU continued (at paras 37 to 38) that, in so far as article
132(1)(i) does not specify the conditions or procedures for defining those
similar objects, it is for the national law of each member state to lay down
rules, and that member states have a discretion in that respect; and it is for
the national courts to examine whether member states, in imposing such
conditions, have observed the limits of their discretion in applying the
principles of EU law, in particular the principle of equal treatment, which, in
the field of VAT, takes the form of the principle of fiscal neutrality.</a></p><a name="para22">

explained at para 39:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… point (i) of article 132(1), article
133 and article 134, of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that

(i) of article 132(1) of that directive precludes a general exemption of all
supplies of educational services, without consideration of the objects pursued
by non-public organisations providing those services.”</p>

Finance and Management (London) Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2001/1175.html">[2001] STC 1690</a>. The School of Finance
and Management London (“SFM”) delivered a number of courses of study for the
University of Lincolnshire and Humberside and claimed to be exempt from VAT as
a college of a university under Note (1)(b) to Group 6 of Schedule 9 to the VAT
Act. The tribunal found that SFM’s fundamental purpose was to provide education
services leading to the award of a university degree and that it was fairly to
be regarded as a college of the university. On appeal, the Commissioners
contended first, that, having regard to the provisions of the Sixth Directive
set out above, Note (1)(b) only encompassed bodies governed by public law
having education as their aim; secondly, that SFM was not a college; and
thirdly, if SFM was a college, it was not a college of a United Kingdom
university.</p>

</span>The judge rejected all three contentions and dismissed the appeal. So
far as the third was concerned, the parties put forward a non-exhaustive list
of 15 relevant factors - termed the “SFM factors” - which fell to be
considered. For their part, the Commissioners relied on eight factors, the
first four of which were said to be determinative: (i) the presence of a
foundation document establishing the college as part of the university by way
of a constitutional link; (ii) an absence of independence on the part of the
college; (iii) the financial dependence of the college on the university or the
financial interdependence of each on the other; (iv) the absence of
distributable profit; (v) an entitlement to public funding; (vi) the presence
of permanent links between the college and the university; (vii) the physical
proximity of the college to the university; and (viii) an obligation on the
college to offer a minimum number of university places.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>SFM accepted that all of these factors were arguably relevant but argued
that none was determinative. It contended that of more relevance were seven further
factors: (ix) the possession by the college of a similar purpose to that of the
university; (x) the provision by the college of courses leading to a degree
from the university; (xi) the supervision by the university of the college’s
courses and the regulation by the university of the quality standards of those
courses; (xii) the admission of students of the college as members of the
university with university identity cards; (xiii) the submission of students of
the college to disciplinary regulations and requirements of the university;
(xiv) the entitlement of successful students of the college to receive a degree
from the university at a university degree ceremony; and (xv) the description
of the college as an associate/affiliated college of the university. The Commissioners
accepted these were relevant (subject to their submissions as to the
determinative nature of the first four of their own features).</a></p><a name="para33">

</span>Shortly after Burton J handed down his judgment, the Court of Appeal
gave judgment in <i>Customs and Excise Comrs v University of Leicester
Student’s Union</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1972.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 1972</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1972.html">[2002] STC 147</a>. Here the issue was
whether supplies of drinks by the student’s union of Leicester University were
exempt from VAT. The Commissioners took the view that they were not. By an
interim decision on a preliminary issue, the Manchester VAT tribunal held that
the union was an integral part of the university and so an eligible body, and it
was entitled to an exemption in respect of any supplies which were closely
related to the supply of education within the meaning of Item 4 of Group 6 of
Schedule 9. On appeal, the judge considered that the real question was whether
the union was an integral part of the university such that it could properly be
said that the soft drinks sold in the union were sold by the university. He
held it could not, and that, in consequence, the tribunal ought to have held
that the soft drinks were not supplied by the eligible body making the
principal supply of education within the meaning of Item 4. On further appeal
to the Court of Appeal, the substantial argument was, as before the judge,
whether the union was an integral part of the university and as such an eligible
body. The Court of Appeal found it was not. It was not encompassed by the
phrase “a United Kingdom university” for it was an entity distinct from the
university. Further, it was not an “institution of such a university” within
the meaning of Note 1(b) because it supplied no education. Peter Gibson LJ,
with whom Morland J agreed, explained at para 36:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note 1(b) on its face
refers to five entities, a United Kingdom University, and four entities of such
a University. The conjunction connecting ‘a United Kingdom University’ with the
four other entities is the word ‘and’, not ‘including’. Further, the four other
entities are alternative to each other as can be seen by the conjunction ‘or’
between ‘school’ and ‘hall’. On the ordinary and natural meaning of the words
used in note 1(b) I would construe them as covering both a university itself
and, in those cases where there are separate entities which are nevertheless
parts of that university, any of those separate entities. Furthermore, the
common characteristic of all those four entities in my opinion is that they are
suppliers of education.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Arden LJ considered that the student’s union did promote an object of
utility within the university community and was potentially an institution of
the university. But the question for her was whether the term “institution” had
a narrower meaning in the context of Note (1)(b). She answered that question in
two steps, the first of which was to consider the meaning of the expression “of
such a university”:</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note 1(b) uses the
expression ‘the university’ and ‘of the university’. In the latter expression
the word ‘of’ cannot mean ‘belong to’ or ‘form part of’ since the former is not
the case with regard to Oxbridge colleges (which are presumably intended to be
covered) and the latter is included within the expression ‘the university’. In
other words, the expression ‘of the university’ seems to me to denote a state
of affairs whereby the university is in some sense an umbrella organisation
which provides education and related services in conjunction with other bodies
or wherein the body in question has some form of status under the University
statutes, for example to present candidates for matriculation.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second was to consider the meaning of the word “institution” in this
context. Here she did not agree that a college, institution, school or hall of
a university had itself to be a supplier of education. For her the key question
was whether the body in question had academic links with the university and so
recognition from the university, and this the union did not have.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The third decision is that of the Court of Appeal in <i>Finance and
Business Training Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/7.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 7</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/7.html">[2016] STC 2190</a>. Here the question was whether the taxpayer, “FBT”, a profit-making
enterprise, was exempt from VAT in respect of the supply of courses leading to
the grant of degrees by the University of Wales. The FTT decided it was not.
Although it supplied a university education, FBT also had to show that it was
an integrated part of the university, and that it had failed to do. In reaching
this conclusion, the FTT applied the SFM factors and attached particular weight
to the nature of the relationship between FBT and the university, which it
found to be short term, commercial and held out as being one of partnership. An
appeal to the UT was dismissed. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal, it
was argued by FBT, among other things, that Parliament had failed to set
conditions for the education exemption in accordance with EU law and, in
particular, the principles of legal certainty and fiscal neutrality. Arden LJ
(with whom Gloster and Sharp LJJ agreed), rejected that submission. She
explained that it was up to each member state to set the conditions under which
bodies not governed by public law would be entitled to the education exemption,
and how it did so was a matter for national law. It was therefore open to
Parliament to decide which non-public bodies would qualify, and it had done so
in Note (1)(b). However, Parliament was constrained by article 132(1)(i) as to
which bodies it could include. She continued, at paras 55 to 57:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … In those circumstances,
it has taken the view that the body must be one which provides education in
like manner to a body governed by public law, that is, there must be a public
interest element in its work. It has decided to draw the line, in the case of
universities to those colleges, halls and schools which are integrated into
universities and which are therefore imbued with its objects.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For FBT to show that its
exclusion from this group is a breach of the fiscal neutrality principle would
require it to say that it belongs to the same class as those institutions which
meet the integration test in Note (1)(b). Neither of the tribunals made any
findings that would support that conclusion and this court is hearing an appeal
only on a point of law.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FBT contends that Parliament
has not met the requirements of the EU law principle of legal certainty by
setting out criteria which are to apply to determine when non-public bodies
seek to enjoy the education exemption. The criteria have to be ‘neutral,
abstract and defined in advance’. In my judgment, this is achieved by the
combination of note (1)(b) and the SFM factors. These factors are neutral, they
are abstract and defined in advance. By applying them, it is possible to know
what supplies and which suppliers qualify for exemption.”</p>

</span>The FTT carried out a multi-factorial assessment in order to determine
whether SEL was sufficiently integrated with MU to justify the conclusion that
it was a college of the university and for that purpose considered each of the
15 SFM factors. In carrying out that exercise, it conducted an extensive
analysis of the evidence. Having done so, it was satisfied that SEL, as the
United Kingdom arm of SAEI, had since May 2009 been an “Associate College” of MU,
and a college of MU within the meaning of Note 1(b). It set out the factors
which it considered carried the greatest weight at para 293:</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>On further appeal by the Commissioners, the UT adopted an approach which
differed in some respects from that of the FTT. It explained that it is
necessary to adopt a multi-step evaluation of the relationship between the
undertaking and the university. It must first be determined whether they had a
common understanding of their relationship. If they did, the next question is
whether they had a common understanding that the undertaking was a college of
the university. If the answer to that question is also in the affirmative, it
must be considered whether the relationship was sufficiently close to justify
the conclusion that the undertaking was indeed a college of the university
within the meaning of Note 1(b), and it is here that the SFM factors are
relevant. If the relationship was sufficiently close, the final step is to
consider whether the undertaking supplied university-level education. It was
the UT’s view that the FTT failed properly to take the first and second steps,
and had it done so it would have found that they should be answered in the
negative. It therefore allowed the Commissioners’ appeal.</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="ParaHeading">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeal</p>

</span>The approach of the Court of Appeal differed from those of both the FTT
and the UT. Patten LJ (with whom Black and Sales LJJ agreed) explained that the
test of whether an undertaking is part of a university is considerably more
“hard edged” than earlier decisions had suggested. It is necessary for the
relevant undertaking to show that it is a part of the university in the sense
of being a constituent part with all the rights and privileges for its students
which that entails. Inherent in this test is the need to demonstrate some legal
relationship which establishes and confirms the status of the undertaking. It
matters not whether this relationship is embodied in a formal foundation or
constitutional document or whether it is based upon some other binding
agreement. But it has to be one which in a real sense makes the undertaking a
constituent part of the university. It had not been established that SEL was a
part of MU in a constitutional or structural sense and so the appeal fell to be
dismissed.</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="ParaHeading">Note 1(b) - the correct approach</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point for a consideration of the proper interpretation of
Note 1(b) to Schedule 9, Group 6, Item 1 of the VAT Act must be articles 131 to
133 of the Principal VAT Directive. These make clear that member states must
exempt transactions involving the provision of, among other things, university
education by bodies governed by public law having such education as their aim. Member
states must also exempt transactions by other organisations which they have
recognised as having similar objects to those governed by public law and which
also have education as their aim.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In accordance with well-established principles, the terms used in
articles 131 to 133 to specify exemptions from VAT must be construed strictly.
Nevertheless, they must also be construed in a manner which is consistent with
the objectives which underpin them and not in such a way as to deprive them of
their intended effects.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The general objective of the exemptions in articles 133 to 135 is, I
think, readily apparent and, so far as university education is concerned, it is
to ensure that access to the higher educational services this necessarily
involves is not hindered by the increased costs that would result if those
services were subject to VAT. This was explained by the CJEU in <i>Commission of
the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany</i> (Case C-287/00)
[2002] ECR-I-5811; </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2002/C28700.html">[2002] STC 982</a>, a decision which concerned article 13A(1)(i)
of the Sixth Directive, which, as we have seen, is an exemption drawn in very
similar terms to those of article 132(1)(i) of the Principal VAT Directive. The
court said this about the purpose of the Article in considering the concept of “services
which are closely related” to university education, and whether research
activities fell within its scope:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, that
concept does not require an especially strict interpretation since the
exemption of the supply of services closely related to university education is
designed to ensure that access to the benefits of such education is not
hindered by the increased costs of providing it that would follow if it, or the
supply of services and of goods closely related to it, were subject to VAT
(see, by analogy, in relation to article 13(A)(1)(b) of the Sixth Directive, <i>Commission
v France</i> (Case C-76/99) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C7699.html">[2001] ECR I-249</a>, para 23). However, if the
undertaking by State universities of research projects for consideration is
made subject to VAT, that does not have the effect of increasing the cost of
university education.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That does not mean that all organisations which provide educational
services may be granted a tax exemption by member states, however. The services
must be provided by organisations governed by public law or by other
organisations recognised by the member state in issue as having similar objects.
It is essentially for this combination of reasons that the CJEU held in <i>MDDP
</i>that articles 132(1) and 133 of the Principal VAT Directive do not preclude
the inclusion of educational services provided by private organisations for
commercial purposes in the tax exemption but do preclude a general exemption of
all supplies of educational services without consideration of the objects
pursued by the private organisations which are providing them.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In implementing articles 132 and 133 of the Principal VAT Directive, the
United Kingdom and other member states therefore had a discretion in deciding
which bodies, other than those governed by public law, they would recognise as
providing educational services, including university education. But that
discretion was limited in the manner I have described, and whilst it was open
to member states to exempt educational services provided by private bodies for
commercial purposes, they could not do so without consideration of the objects
those bodies pursued. It was also limited in other important respects for, in
implementing the Directive, member states were required to respect the general
principles of law that form part of the order of the European Union, including
the principles of fiscal neutrality, legal certainty and proportionality.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I have explained, Parliament has chosen to exercise the discretion
conferred upon it by exempting from VAT, so far as relevant, the provision of
education by a United Kingdom university and any college of such a university.
The term “university” is not defined in the VAT Act. However, the conditions
under which a body in the United Kingdom is entitled to use the word university
in its title are regulated by statute. Over 100 bodies are presently entitled
to call themselves a university and they vary greatly in character. A small but
nonetheless significant number of them are private and run for profit. Some,
such as the University of London, are collegiate federal universities in which,
for many purposes, the constituent colleges operate on an independent basis.
Others, such as the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge,
comprise a kind of federal system of colleges, schools and faculties, in which
the colleges are generally financially independent and self-governing. These
are just examples. Other universities also comprise or have close relationships
with colleges, including the University of the Arts London, the University of
the Highlands and Islands and Queen’s University of Belfast. The connection
between each of these universities and its respective colleges has its own
particular character and is a reflection of the history of the institutions
involved.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is against the background of the range of possible arrangements
between universities and their colleges that the meaning of the phrase “college
of such a university” in Note (1)(b) falls to be determined. In my judgment the
following points are material.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, for its activities to fall within the scope of Item 1(a), any
college of a university, as an eligible body, must provide education.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly and as we have seen, the supply of educational services is
exempt only if it is provided by bodies governed by public law or by other
bodies recognised by the member state as having similar objects. Parliament has
exercised the discretion conferred upon it by recognising for this purpose the
provision of education by universities, and it has done so regardless of
whether those universities are charities or are private and run for profit. If,
as I believe, the phrase “a United Kingdom university” in Note 1(b) therefore
extends to private universities which are run for profit then in my opinion the
same must apply to the expression “any college of such a university”. There can
be no justification for treating the scope of the two expressions differently
in this respect. Further, were it otherwise, private colleges of a university
providing higher education services would be obliged to charge VAT on their
supplies, rendering them more expensive and so restricting the opportunities of
students to access them, contrary to the purpose of the exemption.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, there is in my view nothing in Note 1(b) or the broader context
which would justify limiting the scope of the phrase “any college of such a
university” to colleges which are a constituent part of a university in a
constitutional or structural sense. To the contrary, if satisfaction of such a
constituent part test were required, it would effectively exclude commercial
providers such as SEL from the exemption for it is a test they will rarely if
ever be able to satisfy. That, so it seems to me, would be contrary to the
principle of fiscal neutrality in the light of the decision by Parliament not
to limit the bodies it has recognised in Note 1(b) to those which do not make a
profit.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, the United Kingdom must be taken to have recognised that a
college (or, for that matter, a school or hall) of a university within the
meaning of Note 1(b) has similar objects to those of a university which is
governed by public law and which provides education to young people. In my
opinion this consideration focuses attention on the objects of the body in
issue, the nature of the educational services that it supplies, and how
integrated those services are with those of the university. Put another way, it
is necessary to examine the characteristics of those educational services and
the context in which they are delivered rather than the precise nature of the
legal and constitutional relationship between the body that provides them and
its university.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Of course, I recognise that if a college is a part of a university in a
constitutional or structural sense then it is overwhelmingly likely that any
educational services it provides will reflect this relationship and so the
college may properly be regarded as a college of that university within the
meaning of Note 1(b). But it does not follow that the converse is also true. It
is entirely possible that an independent and private body which conducts its
business of providing education for profit will be so integrated with a
university that its educational activities and objects are indistinguishable
from those of a college which is constitutionally part of the university or,
indeed, from those of the university itself.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All of these matters point to the conclusion that the “integration” test
explained in the <i>SFM</i> case and adopted by the FTT is essentially correct.
However, I think the factors to be considered do need some refinement. As I
have said, the presence of a foundation or constitutional document or some
other legal relationship establishing the college as a constituent part of the
university in a constitutional or structural sense will be sufficient to prove
that it is a college of the university within the meaning of Note 1(b), save in
an exceptional case. But that is not a necessary condition. In assessing
whether a body is a college of a university the following five questions are
also likely to be highly relevant: (i) whether they have a common understanding
that the body is a college of the university; (ii) whether the body can enrol
or matriculate students as students of the university; (iii) whether those
students are generally treated as students of the university during the course
of their period of study; (iv) whether the body provides courses of study which
are approved by the university; and (v) whether the body can in due course
present its students for examination for a degree from the university.</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a body can establish the presence of each of these five features,
focused as they are on the objects of the body, the relationship between the
students of the body and the university and the degree to which the activities
of the body are recognised by and integrated with the university, then in my
judgment it is highly likely to be a college of the university within the
meaning of Note 1(b). Again, I do not suggest that there may not be other cases
where the degree of integration of the activities of the body and the
university is such that it may properly be described as a college of the university
in light of some or most of the factors I have identified and other aspects of
the services it supplies. All will depend on the particular circumstances of
the case.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, some of the SFM factors are, in my view, likely to be of much
less assistance in light of the matters to which I have referred. Here I have
in mind: (i) whether the body is independent from the university; (ii) whether
the body is financially dependent on the university, or whether the body and
the university are financially interdependent; (iii) whether the body generates
any distributable profit; (iv) whether the body is entitled to public funding;
(v) the presence or absence of permanent links between the body and the
university; (vi) the degree of physical proximity between the body and the
university; and (vii) whether the body has any an obligation to offer a minimum
number of university places. I do not suggest that none of these matters will
ever have any evidential weight. For example, the duration of the relationship between
the body and the university and how long it may be expected to last may have
some relevance, if only as part of the background, but these and similar
matters are unlikely to be determinative.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment it follows that the reasoning of Peter Gibson LJ in the <i>University
of Leicester Student’s Union </i>case at para 36 (which I have set out at para
34 above) needs some qualification. I accept that the words “in those cases
where there are separate entities which are nevertheless parts of the university,
any of those separate entities” in Note 1(b) include a college, institution,
school or hall of a university which is separate from the university but which
is nevertheless a part of it in a constitutional or structural sense. But, for
the reasons I have given, I do not accept that the scope of Note 1(b) is
limited to such entities, and if that is what Peter Gibson LJ meant by the use
of these words, I respectfully disagree with him. In my view the correct
approach was expressed succinctly by Arden LJ in <i>FBT </i>at para 55, which I
have recited above. The question is whether the college and the university are
so integrated that the entity is imbued with the objects of the university, and
that is best answered in the manner I have described.</a></p><a name="para56">

<p class="ParaHeading">Did the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal fall into
error?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The UT did not reject the integration approach or question the value of
the SFM factors but introduced the sequential test which I have set out at para
39 above. I recognise that if a taxpaying body is a college of a university one
would expect to see some recognition of that by the university. I also accept
the importance of establishing that the university and the body have a common
understanding that the body is a college of the university. But it seems to me that
these are matters which are best addressed in the context of and as part of the
general assessment of their relationship, the extent to which their activities
are integrated and whether they share the same objects.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That brings me to the judgment of Patten LJ in the Court of Appeal, with
which Black and Sales LJJ agreed. It is carefully reasoned and merits great
respect. His analysis began with the FA 1972. He noted, entirely correctly,
that it exempted the provision of education by an eligible body and that it
defined the term “university” as including a university college and the
college, school or hall of a university. He also observed, again correctly,
that at the time this exemption came into effect the relevant EU provisions on
exemptions were those contained in article 10 of the Second Directive which, as
we have seen, gave each member state a broad discretion as to which exemptions
to create beyond the supply of goods to places outside that state, and services
relating to such goods or goods in transit. He concluded, and I agree, that the
language of item 1 in the FA 1972 must be taken to represent what Parliament
considered at that time should constitute the scope of the exemption for the
supply of education by a university.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ turned next to the meaning of the phrase “college, school, or
hall of a university” in the context of United Kingdom universities as they
operated in 1972. Here, focusing on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,
he observed that their colleges and private halls, though self-governing and
legally independent, formed an integral part of the structure of their
respective universities and that their members made up the university’s
teaching staff and students.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ also found support for his approach in the provisions of the
Education Reform Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) and the Education (Listed Bodies)
(England) Order 2010 (the “2010 Order”) made under it. The 1988 Act makes it an
offence to award a degree that is not a recognised award. Under section 214(2),
a “recognised award” includes an award granted or to be granted by a university
which is authorised by Royal Charter or Act of Parliament to grant degrees, and
any award granted or to be granted by any body for the time being permitted by
a university to act on its behalf. Any such body falls within the definition of
a “recognised body” in section 216(4).</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 216(2) of the 1988 Act requires the Secretary of State to
compile and publish by order a list of the names of the bodies which appear to
him to fall within section 216(3) which provides, so far as relevant:</a></p><a name="para61">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A body falls within this
subsection if it is not a recognised body and it:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">… (b)&nbsp; is a constituent college,
school or hall or other institution of a university which is a recognised
body.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The 2010 Order was made pursuant to section 216(2) and, as Patten LJ
observed, it lists, among other bodies, all the colleges and halls of the
universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Queen’s University Belfast, and
the Institutes constituting the School of Advanced Study in the University of
London. I would add that the 2010 Order was revoked and replaced by The
Education (Listed Bodies) (England) Order 2013 which came into force on 30
December 2013. This expands the list of colleges and halls and includes one
college of the University of South Wales and several colleges of the University
of the Highlands and Islands.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was notable, Patten LJ continued, that the provisions of section
216(3)(b) were all but identical to those of Schedule 5, Group 6, Item 1 of the
FA 1972 in defining what was included in a university, and it was unlikely that
the similarity between the provisions was accidental. He recognised that the
purpose of the two sets of provisions was very different but thought that both
of them were seeking to identify the constituent parts of a university; and
further, that the 1988 Act and the 2010 Order provided a useful illustration of
how essentially the same statutory language had come to be interpreted and
applied, albeit in the regulation of the granting of degrees.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ turned next to the VAT Act. Here he noted what he termed the
stylistic and grammatical differences between Note 1(b) of Schedule 9, Group 6,
Item 1 of the VAT Act and the definition of a university in Note (3) of
Schedule 5, Group 6, Item 1 of the FA 1972 but he could see nothing in these
differences or in the Sixth Directive to justify giving what he thought was
essentially the same language a much wider meaning. He was of the view that
there was nothing in the EU legislation which compelled member states to cast
the scope of the exemption more widely than, in the case of the United Kingdom,
it had previously chosen to do. He thought the focus of Note 1(b), and that of
Note (3) before it, was on identifying the constituent parts of the university.
The phrase “of a university” was common to both statutes and in his opinion
this was determinative of the position.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ also considered the decisions in <i>SFM</i>, <i>University of
Leicester</i> <i>Student’s Union </i>and <i>FBT</i>. Having done so, he was
still of the view that it was necessary for SEL to establish what he understood
Peter Gibson LJ to have described in <i>University of Leicester Student’s Union</i>,
namely that it was a part of the university in the sense of being a constituent
part with all the rights and privileges for its students and other members
which that entailed.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_1"></a><a name="HIT_1"></a>66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment Patten LJ has fallen into error in the following
important respects. First, in focusing on the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge,
all of which form a part of the structure of their respective universities, he
has failed to take into account the variety of reasonable and foreseeable
arrangements between a university and a college.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the 1988 Act is in my view of no real assistance in construing
the provisions of Schedule 9, Group 6 of the VAT Act. The 1988 Act does not
purport to implement or give effect to any EU legislation, let alone the Sixth
Directive or the Principal VAT Directive. Further and as Patten LJ himself
recognised, the purposes of the 1988 Act and the orders made under it are very
different from those of the VAT Act. The 1988 Act is concerned with the grant
of awards. The relevant provisions of the VAT Act, on the other hand, are
concerned with the provision of education.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, Patten LJ has in my view failed properly to take into account
the difference between the provisions of the First and Second Directives, on
the one hand, and those of the Sixth Directive and the Principal VAT Directive,
on the other, namely the scope and nature of the discretion they respectively
confer on member states to exempt supplies of education from VAT. The
provisions of the VAT Act are not the same as those of the FA 1972 and, most
importantly, must be interpreted in the light of the wording and purpose of the
Sixth Directive and now the VAT Directive, the breadth of the discretion
conferred on member states by those Directives, and the need for Parliament, in
exercising that discretion, to apply the relevant principles of EU law,
including the principle of equal treatment.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, and for the reasons I have given, the judgment of Peter Gibson
LJ in <i>University of Leicester Student’s Union</i> does not provide any sound
support for the conclusion Patten LJ reached.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have therefore come to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal has fallen
into error. The correct approach is to ascertain the nature and purpose of the
educational activities of the college in issue, and whether those activities
are so integrated with those of its university that it may properly be said to
have the same objects as that university. That exercise may conveniently be
carried out in the manner I have described at paras 47 to 56 above.</a></p><a name="para70">

<p class="ParaHeading">The application of the correct approach</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment the analysis of the evidence carried out by the FTT was
careful and comprehensive. It found, among other things, that SEL, as the
United Kingdom arm of SAEI, had been an “Associate College” of MU since May
2009 and that the parties had proceeded on that basis; that the links between
SAEI and MU were well established and likely to endure; that most of SEL’s
courses were supervised by MU and their quality was regulated by MU; that SEL’s
purposes were similar to those of MU; that SEL’s students became students of MU
and received degrees from MU; and that the activities of SEL were substantially
integrated into those of MU. It identified the factors upon which it
particularly relied in the passage I have set out at para 38 above. In my
judgment these findings had a sufficient basis in the evidence and there is no
proper ground for interfering with them.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In allowing the appeal, the UT considered that the FTT failed to
distinguish between the activities of SAEI and those of SEL. It found that the
various agreements relied upon by SEL were made between SAEI and MU; that SAEI
was not a college of MU and SEL had the same status as SAEI; that MU was
initially unaware of SEL’s existence as a corporate entity and so there was no
common understanding between them; and that the FTT failed properly to consider
what was meant by the term “Associate College”.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment these are not fair criticisms. In May 2009 SEL stepped
into the shoes of SETL and from that point was the entity through which the
activities of SAEI were conducted in the United Kingdom. The factual findings
of the FTT were sufficient to justify its conclusion that SEL’s activities were
integrated into those of MU and that it shared the objects of MU. In my opinion
the FTT was entitled to find that in May 2009 SEL became and thereafter
remained a college of MU within the meaning of Schedule 9, Group 6, Item 1,
Note (1)(b) of the VAT Act.</a></p><a name="para73">
