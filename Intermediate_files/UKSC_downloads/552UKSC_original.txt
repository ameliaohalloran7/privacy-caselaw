</span>The question at issue on this appeal is whether two provisions of the
State Immunity Act 1978 are consistent with the European Convention on Human
Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The two provisions
are section 4(2)(b) and section 16(1)(a). I shall set out both below, but in
summary the effect of section 4(2)(b) is that a state is immune as respects
proceedings relating to a contract of employment between a state and a person
who at the time of the contract is neither a national of the United Kingdom nor
resident there; and the effect of section 16(1)(a) is that a state is immune as
respects proceedings concerning the employment of members of a diplomatic
mission, including its administrative, technical and domestic staff. It is
common ground that the answer depends in both cases on whether these provisions
have any basis in customary international law although, as I shall explain,
there is an issue about what kind of basis it must have.</a></p><a name="para1">

</span>Ms Minah Janah, the Respondent to this appeal, is a Moroccan national.
In 2005, when she was resident in Libya, she was recruited to work for the
Libyan government as a domestic worker at its embassy in London. She entered
the United Kingdom on a visa which recorded her status as “Domestic Worker
(Diplomatic)”, and continued to work for the embassy until she was dismissed in
2012. During that time, she worked successively in a number of Libyan
diplomatic households, and latterly in the residence of the ambassador. Her
duties were cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping and serving at meals. In April
2012, she began proceedings against Libya in the Employment Tribunal in support
of a claim for failure to pay her the National Minimum Wage, breaches of the
Working Time Regulations, failure to provide her with payslips or a contract of
employment, unfair dismissal, discrimination and harassment. At all material
times since her arrival in the United Kingdom, Ms Janah has been resident, but
not permanently resident here.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>Ms Fatimah Benkharbouche is also a Moroccan national. In 2000, when she
was working for the Sudanese government in Iraq, she agreed to move to the
United Kingdom to work for its embassy in London as a housekeeper and cook to
the ambassador. Her employment by the London embassy began on 16 May 2000 and
continued until the autumn of 2001. She then returned for some years to Iraq,
before being re-engaged to work for the London embassy in the same role as
before. Her second term of employment began on 28 January 2005 and continued
until she was dismissed on 27 November 2010. She subsequently began proceedings
in the Employment Tribunal in support of claims for unfair dismissal, failure
to pay her the National Minimum Wage, unpaid wages and holiday pay, and
breaches of the Working Time Regulations. By the time of her dismissal, she was
permanently resident in the United Kingdom, having been granted indefinite
leave to remain with effect from 25 January 2010.</a></p><a name="para3">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that under the terms of the State Immunity Act 1978,
Libya is entitled to state immunity in respect of Ms Janah’s claim and Sudan in
respect of Ms Benkharbouche’s. In Ms Janah’s case, this is because she has
never been a Libyan national and was not a national or permanent resident of
the United Kingdom at the time when her contract was made. Both section 4(2)(b)
and section 16(1)(a) therefore apply to her. In Ms Benkharbouche’s case, it is
because section 16(1)(a) applies to her. There are as yet no findings about
whether the facts of her case bring her within section 4(2)(b). Both claims
were dismissed by different judges in the Employment Tribunal on the ground
that the employer was immune.</a></p><a name="para4">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Employment Appeal Tribunal the two cases were heard together. The
EAT declared that sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) of the Act should be disapplied
so far as they prevented Ms Janah from bringing claims based on EU law, on the
ground that they were contrary to the right of access to a court guaranteed by
article 47 of the EU Charter. The claims based on discrimination and harassment
and breaches of the Working Time Regulations were accordingly allowed to
proceed. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted, inter alia, in
order to enable it to consider whether to make a declaration of incompatibility
under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998. This led to the joinder of the
Secretary of State under section 5 of the Human Rights Act 1998 so as to
participate in the appeal. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the EAT,
disapplying the relevant provisions so far as they applied to the EU law
claims. It also made a declaration of incompatibility affecting all the claims,
whether founded on domestic or EU law.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>Sudan elected not to participate in the proceedings before the Court of
Appeal and has not appealed to this court. Ms Benkharbouche was represented in
the Court of Appeal but has not appeared before us. Libya participated in the
proceedings in the Court of Appeal, but although it was granted permission to
appeal to this court, it has not been permitted to pursue the appeal because it
has failed to comply with an order of this court for security for costs. In
those circumstances, the effective participants in the appeal to this court
have been the Secretary of State, who appeals in both cases, and Ms Janah. We
have also received written and oral submissions on behalf of the AIRE centre,
and written submissions on behalf of 4A Law. It is agreed that Ms Janah’s
appeal raises all of the issues in either case, but I shall refer from time to
time to Ms Benkharbouche’s position also.</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>I propose first to examine the provisions of the State Immunity Act and
then the requirements of the Human Rights Convention, before turning to the
relationship between the Act and the international law of state immunity.</a></p><a name="para7">

<p class="ParaHeading">The State Immunity Act 1978</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before 1978, state immunity was governed in the United Kingdom by the
common law. Properly speaking, it comprised two immunities whose boundaries
were not necessarily the same: an immunity from the adjudicative jurisdiction
of the courts of the forum, and a distinct immunity from process against its
property in the forum state. During the second half of the nineteenth century,
the common law had adopted the doctrine of absolute immunity in relation to both.
The classic statement was that of Lord Atkin in <i><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">Compania Naviera Vascongada v S S
Cristina (The Cristina)</span></i><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:
none"> [1938] AC 485</span>, 490:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The courts of a country will not
implead a foreign sovereign, that is, they will not by their process make him
against his will a party to legal proceedings whether the proceedings involve
process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or
damages.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para8">By 1978, however, the position at common law had changed
as a result of the decisions of the Privy Council in <i>The Philippine Admiral</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1975/1975_21.html">[1977] AC 373</a> and the Court of Appeal in <i>Trendtex Trading Corpn v Central
Bank of Nigeria</i> [1977] QB 529. These decisions marked the adoption by the
common law of the restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity already accepted
by the United States and much of Europe. The restrictive doctrine recognised
state immunity only in respect of acts done by a state in the exercise of
sovereign authority (<i>jure imperii</i>), as opposed to acts of a private law
nature (<i>jure gestionis</i>). Moreover, and importantly, the classification
of the relevant act was taken to depend on its juridical character and not on
the state’s purpose in doing it save in cases where that purpose threw light on
its juridical character: <i>Playa Larga (Owners of Cargo Lately Laden on Board)
v I Congreso del Partido (Owners)</i> [1983] 1 AC 244.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before the adoption of the restrictive doctrine at common law, the
United Kingdom had signed a number of treaties limiting the scope of state
immunity in particular respects. It was a signatory to the International
Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules concerning the Immunity of
State-owned Ships (Brussels, 1926), which restricted the immunity of
state-owned trading vessels. It had also signed the European Convention on
State Immunity (Basle, 1972), a regional treaty drawn up under the auspices of
the Council of Europe which identified specified categories of acts done by
foreign states in the territory of the forum state which would not attract
immunity. These treaties were concerned mainly with acts of a kind which would
generally not attract immunity under the restrictive doctrine. But neither of
them sought to codify the law of state immunity or to apply the restrictive
doctrine generally. In addition, they have attracted limited international
support. The Brussels Convention of 1926 has attracted 31 ratifications to
date. The Basle Convention of 1972 has to date been ratified by only eight of
the 47 countries of the Council of Europe.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One purpose of the State Immunity Act 1978 was to give effect to the
Brussels and Basle Conventions, and thereby enable the United Kingdom to ratify
them. It did this in both cases in 1979. But by this time, the conventions had
been largely superseded by the adoption of the restrictive doctrine of state
immunity at common law. The Act therefore dealt more broadly with state
immunity, by providing in section 1 for a state to be immune from the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the
following sections of Part I. The exceptions relate to a broad range of acts
conceived to be of a private law character, including widely defined categories
of “commercial transactions” and commercial activities, as well as contracts of
employment and enforcement against state-owned property used or intended for
use for commercial purposes. In <i>Alcom Ltd v Republic of Colombia</i> [1984]
AC 580, 597-598, Lord Diplock, with whom the rest of the Appellate Committee
agreed, observed that given the background against which it was enacted, the
provisions of the Act</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“fall to be construed against the
background of those principles of public international law as are generally
recognised by the family of nations. The principle of international law that is
most relevant to the subject matter of the Act is the distinction that has come
to be drawn between claims arising out of those activities which a state
undertakes <i>jure imperii</i>, ie, in the exercise of sovereign authority, and
those arising out of activities which it undertakes <i>jure gestionis</i>, ie
transactions of the kind which might appropriately be undertaken by private
individuals instead of sovereign states.”</p>

</span>For present purposes, the relevant provisions of the State Immunity Act
are sections 1, 3, 4 and 16. So far as they bear on the points at issue, they
provide as follows:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Convention scheduled to the Diplomatic Privileges Act
of 1964 is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). Article 1 of that
Convention defines “members of a mission” as including the “staff of the

16(1)(a) covers employees in the position of Ms Janah and Ms Benkharbouche.</p>

</span>Since the passing of the State Immunity Act, the United Kingdom has
signed, but not ratified, a further treaty, the United Nations Convention on
Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (2004). The Convention
is the result of the long drawn out labours of the United Nations International
Law Commission between 1979 and 2004. For the most part, it is consistent with
the United Kingdom Act, which indeed was one of the models used by the
draftsmen. But there are differences, in particular relating to contracts of
employment, which would require the Act to be amended before the United Kingdom
could ratify it. To date, however, the United Nations Convention has attracted
limited support. Twenty-eight states have signed it, including the United
Kingdom. Of these, 21 have ratified it, not including the United Kingdom. Libya
and Sudan have neither signed nor ratified it. It will not come into force
until it has been ratified by 30 states.</a></p><a name="para12">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents’ case is that sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) of the State
Immunity Act 1978 are incompatible with article 6 of the Convention, because
they unjustifiably bar access to a court to determine their claims. Article
4(2)(b) is also said to be incompatible with article 14 read in conjunction
with article 6, because it unjustifiably discriminates on grounds of
nationality. For the moment I shall put the case on discrimination to one side,
to return to it later. The main point argued before us was based on article 6.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention provides that “in the
determination of his civil rights and obligations, or of any criminal charge
against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a
reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.” Two
points are well-established, and uncontroversial in this appeal. The first is
that article 6 implicitly confers a right of access to a court to determine a
dispute and not just a right to have it tried fairly: <i>Golder v United Kingdom</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1975/1.html">(1975) 1 EHRR 524</a>. The “right to a court” corresponds to a right which the
common law has recognised for more than two centuries. As early as the 1760s,
Blackstone wrote in his <i>Commentaries</i>, 4th ed (1876), 111:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A … right of every [man] is that
of applying to the courts of justice for redress of injuries. Since the law is
in England the supreme arbiter of every man’s life, liberty and property,
courts of justice must at all times be open to the subject and the law be duly
administered therein.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The second uncontroversial point is that although there
is no express qualification to a litigant’s rights under article 6 (except in
relation to the public character of the hearing), the right to a court is not
absolute under the Convention any more than it is at common law. It is an
aspect of the rule of law, which may justify restrictions if they pursue a
legitimate objective by proportionate means and do not impair the essence of
the claimant’s right: <span class="sb8d990e2"><i>Ashingdane v United Kingdom</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1985/8.html">(1985) 7 EHRR 528</a>, para 57.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One of the perennial problems posed by the right to a court is
that article 6 is concerned with the judicial processes of Convention states,
and not with the content of their substantive law. When the Duke of Westminster
complained in <i>James v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 123</a> that the
Leasehold Reform Act 1967 allowed qualifying leaseholders to enfranchise their
properties without providing any grounds on which the freeholder could object,
he was met with the answer (para 81) that article 6 “<span class="sb8d990e2">does
not in itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) rights and
obligations in the substantive law of the Contracting States.” In <i>Fayed v
United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1994/27.html">(1994) 18 EHRR 393</a>, the Court explained (para 65) that it
was not at liberty to “create through the interpretation of article 6(1) a
substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the state concerned”, but
that it would be inconsistent with the rule of law if the state were to “confer
immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons.”
These statements have been repeated in much of the subsequent case law of the
Strasbourg Court. It is </span>not always easy to distinguish between cases in
which the petitioner’s problem arose from some difficulty in accessing the
adjudicative jurisdiction of the court, and cases where it arose from the rules
of law which fell to be applied when he got there. The jurisprudence of the
Strasbourg court establishes that, as a general rule, the question whether such
cases amount to the creation of “immunities” engaging article 6 depends on
whether the rule which prevents the litigant from succeeding is procedural or
substantive: see, among other cases, <span class="sb8d990e2"><i>Fayed v United
Kingdom</i>, at para 67; <i>Al-Adsani v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/761.html">(2002) 34 EHRR 11</a>,

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The dichotomy between procedural and substantive rules is not
always as straightforward as it sounds, partly because the categories are not
wholly distinct and partly because they do not exhaust the field. There may be
rules of law, such as limitation, which are procedural in the sense that they
bar the remedy, not the right, but which operate as a defence. There may be
rules of law which require proceedings to be dismissed without consideration of
the merits. These may be substantive rules, such as the foreign act of state
doctrine, or procedural rules such as state immunity. There may be rules,
whether substantive or procedural, which limit the territorial or
subject-matter jurisdiction of the domestic courts, and which they have no
discretion to transgress. <span class="sfbbfee58">Or the claimant’s </span>right
may be circumscribed by a substantive defence, such as privilege in the law of
defamation. Or he may simply have no legal right to assert under the domestic
law, for example because the law is that no<span class="sfbbfee58"> relevant duty
is owed by a particular class of defendants although it would be by defendants
generally. </span>But these are not refinements with which the Strasbourg court
has traditionally been concerned. What the Strasbourg court means by a
procedural rule is a rule which, whether technically procedural or substantive
in character, has the effect of barring a claim for reasons which do not go to
its legal merits; t<span class="sb8d990e2">hat is to say, rules which do not
define the existence or extent of any legal obligation.</span></a></p><a name="para16">

immunity, which the modern law treats as serving an essentially functional
purpose, state immunity does not derive from the need to protect the integrity
of a foreign state’s governmental functions or the proper conduct of
inter-state relations. It derives from the sovereign equality of states. <i>Par
in parem non habet imperium</i>. In the modern law the immunity does not extend
to acts of a private law character. In respect of these, the state is subject
to the territorial jurisdiction of the forum in the same way as any non-state
party. In <i>Germany v Italy: Greece Intervening (Jurisdictional Immunities of
the State)</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2012/10.html">[2012] ICJ Rep 99</a>, at para 59, the International Court of
Justice observed that the rule</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“occupies an important place in
international law and international relations. It derives from the principle of
sovereign equality of States, which, as article 2, para 1, of the Charter of
the United Nations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles of the
international legal order.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The rule, where it applies, is that a state may not be
impleaded in a domestic court <i>against its will</i>. State immunity may be
waived. But waiver does not dispense with the rule. It is inherent in the rule.
It is a voluntary submission to the forum court’s jurisdiction, which
constitutes the consent that has always qualified the rule.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The International Court of Justice has characterised state immunity as procedural:
Democratic Republic of the <i>Congo v Belgium (Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000)</i>
[2002] ICJ Rep 3, paras 59-61; <i>Germany v Italy: Greece Intervening
(Jurisdictional Immunities of the State)</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2012/10.html">[2012] ICJ Rep 99</a>, at paras 92-97.
This is correct, but state immunity is not procedural <span class="sb8d990e2">in
the sense that the organisation and practices of the courts are procedural. It
is procedural in the same sense as that concept has been used in the case law
of the European Court of Human Rights. In other words, it requires the court </span>to
dismiss the claim without determining its merits. But it leaves intact the claimant’s
legal rights and any relevant defences, which remain available, for example, to
be adjudicated upon in the courts of the state itself.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This gives rise to difficulty in a case where the rule goes to the
court’s jurisdiction. Proceedings brought against a state entitled to immunity
are not a nullity<span class="sb8d990e2">. But the court’s jurisdiction to
entertain the proceedings is limited to examining the basis on which immunity
is asserted and determining whether it applies. As the International Court of
Justice put it in <i>Jurisdictional Immunities of the State</i> (para 60), the
question whether the acts relied upon are such as to attract immunity must be
determined “before that jurisdiction can be exercised, whereas the legality or
illegality of the act is something which can be determined only in the exercise
of that jurisdiction.” The impleaded state may consent to the proceedings.
Where, however, it does not consent, there is no jurisdiction to proceed to the
adjudicatory stage. The court must dismiss the claim. As Lord Bingham observed
in <i>Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</i>
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/26.html">[2007] 1 AC 270</a>, at para 14, article 6 cannot confer on a court a jurisdiction
which it does not have, and a state cannot be said to deny access to its courts
if it has no access to give. In <i>Holland v Lampen-Wolfe </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/40.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1573</a>, Lord Millett had put the matter in this way, at p 1588:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Article 6 requires contracting
states to maintain fair and public judicial processes and forbids them to deny
individuals access to those processes for the determination of their civil
rights. It presupposes that the contracting states have the powers of
adjudication necessary to resolve the issues in dispute. But it does not confer
on contracting states adjudicative powers which they do not possess. State
immunity, as I have explained, is a creature of customary international law and
derives from the equality of sovereign states. It is not a self-imposed
restriction on the jurisdiction of its courts which the United Kingdom has
chosen to adopt. It is a limitation imposed from without upon the sovereignty
of the United Kingdom itself.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The immunity in question in the
present case belongs to the United States. The United States has not waived its
immunity. It is not a party to the Convention. The Convention derives its
binding force from the consent of the contracting states. The United Kingdom
cannot, by its own act of acceding to the Convention and without the consent of
the United States, obtain a power of adjudication over the United States which
international law denies it.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Strasbourg court has dealt with many cases involving claims
to state immunity since it first grappled with these matters in <span class="sb8d990e2"><i>Waite and Kennedy v Germany</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1999/13.html">(2000) 30 EHRR 261</a>. Although
the reasoning has been somewhat modified over the years, its position has
remained constant. Notwithstanding the difficulty pointed out in the preceding
paragraph, it has always treated article 6 as being engaged by a successful
claim to state immunity. But it has applied the Convention in the light of
article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, which requires
an international treaty to be interpreted in the light of (inter alia) any
relevant rules of international law. Against that background, it has always
held that the proper application of the rule of state immunity was justifiable
because it was derived from a fundamental principle of international law. The
only cases in which it has ever held article 6 to have been violated are those
in which it has found that a claim to state immunity was unfounded in
international law.</p>

</span>It is convenient to start with three judgments delivered on the

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="sb8d990e2">In <i>Al-Adsani</i>, the applicant had been
barred by state immunity from proceeding in England against the government of
Kuwait in an action claiming damages for torture. The Court held (para 48) that
article 6 was engaged, because “the grant of immunity is seen not as qualifying
a substantive right but as a procedural bar on the national courts’ power to
determine the right.” It rejected the submission of the British government
(para 44) that article 6 could not extend to matters which under international
law lay outside the jurisdiction of the state. However, it held that the bar
was justifiable, for reasons stated at paras 54-56:</span></a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span class="sb8d990e2">“54.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Court must first examine whether the limitation pursued a legitimate aim. It
notes in this connection that sovereign immunity is a concept of international
law, developed out of the principle <i>par in parem non habet imperium, </i>by
virtue of which one State shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of another
State. The Court considers that the grant of sovereign immunity to a State in
civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international
law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of
another State’s sovereignty.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court must next
assess whether the restriction was proportionate to the aim pursued. It recalls
that the Convention has to be interpreted in the light of the rules set out in
the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties, and that article 31(3)(c)
of that treaty indicates that account is to be taken of ‘any relevant rules of
international law applicable in the relations between the parties.’ The
Convention, in including article 6, cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. The
Court must be mindful of the Convention’s special character as a human rights
treaty, and it must also take the relevant rules of international law into
account. The Convention should so far as possible be interpreted in harmony
with other rules of international law of which it forms part, including those
relating to the grant of State immunity.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that measures
taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of
public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as
imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to court as
embodied in article 6(1). Just as the right of access to court is an inherent
part of the fair trial guarantee in that article, so some restrictions on
access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those
limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the
doctrine of State immunity.”</p>

was the first of a number of cases to come before the Strasbourg court
involving employment disputes between a state and non-diplomatic staff at one
of its embassies. It concerned a sex discrimination claim brought in England
against the United States by a secretary employed at US embassy in London. Once
again, the Court held in substantially identical language that article 6(1) was
engaged but not violated. The importance of the decision for present purposes
lies in the additional observations which the Court addressed specifically to
diplomatic employment disputes. The Court said at para 37 that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“on the material before it, there
appears to be a trend in international and comparative law towards limiting
State immunity in respect of employment-related disputes. However, where the
proceedings relate to employment in a foreign mission or embassy, international
practice is divided on the question whether State immunity continues to apply
and, if it does so apply, whether it covers disputes relating to the contracts
of all staff or only more senior members of the mission. Certainly, it cannot
be said that the United Kingdom is alone in holding that immunity attaches to
suits by employees at diplomatic missions or that, in affording such immunity,
the United Kingdom falls outside any currently accepted international
standards.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That being so the Court concluded (para 39) that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“in conferring immunity on the
United States in the present case by virtue of the provisions of the 1978 Act,
the United Kingdom cannot be said to have exceeded the margin of appreciation
allowed to States in limiting an individual's access to court.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">These observations are consistent with the view that in
the absence of a recognised rule of customary international law, article 6 is
satisfied if the rule applied by a Convention state lies within the range of
possible rules consistent with “current international standards”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first case in which the European Court of Human Rights held that the
recognition of state immunity violated article 6(1) of the Convention was <i>Cudak
v Lithuania</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/370.html">(2010) 51 EHRR 15</a>. The applicant was a secretary and
switchboard operator employed in the Polish embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania. The
Supreme Court of Lithuania’s decision appears to have been closely based on the
Strasbourg court’s decision in <i>Fogarty</i>. It had upheld Poland’s claim to
state immunity on the ground that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“there was no uniform
international practice of states whereby the members of staff of foreign
states’ diplomatic missions who participated in the exercise of the public
authority of the states they represented could be distinguished from other
members of staff. As there were no legally binding international rules, it was
for each state to take its own decisions in such matters.” (para 24)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The European Court of Human Rights reiterated the general
principles governing the application of article 6 in such cases, which they had
previously laid down in <i>Fogarty</i>. They held that although that had been a
complaint about the employer’s recruitment practices, the same principles
applied to claims arising out of a subsisting employment relationship. However,
they held that the Lithuanian courts had exceeded the margin of appreciation
available to them. The reason was that there were now binding international
rules on contracts of employment. The court found these rules in article 11 of
the International Law Commission’s draft articles of 1991 on Jurisdictional
Immunities of States and their Property. The draft articles were part of the <i>travaux
preparatoires</i> for what ultimately became, 13 years later, the United
Nations Convention. Draft article 11(1) provided that there was no immunity in
respect of contracts of employment to be performed in the forum state, save in
five cases specified in draft article 11(2). The five cases were:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the employee has been
recruited to perform functions closely related to the exercise of governmental
authority;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the subject of the
proceeding is the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of an
individual;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the employee was neither
a national nor a habitual resident of the State of the forum at the time when
the contract of employment was concluded;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the employee is a
national of the employer State at the time when the proceeding is instituted;
or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the employer State and
the employee have otherwise agreed in writing, subject to any considerations of
public policy conferring on the courts of the State of the forum exclusive
jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter of the proceeding.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Strasbourg court recognised that the draft articles
were not a treaty and that Lithuania had not ratified the Convention ultimately
adopted. But it held that article 11 was nevertheless binding on the state
because it reflected customary international law: see paras 64-67. The court
considered that none of the five exceptions in draft article 11(2) applied. In
particular, exception (a) did not apply. It then reviewed the Lithuanian
Supreme Court’s findings of fact and concluded that it had given inadequate
reasons for regarding the applicant’s employment as being related to the
exercise of governmental authority:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court observes in
particular that the applicant was a switchboard operator at the Polish Embassy
whose main duties were: recording international conversations, typing, sending
and receiving faxes, photocopying documents, providing information and
assisting with the organisation of certain events. Neither the Lithuanian
Supreme Court nor the respondent Government have shown how these duties could
objectively have been related to the sovereign interests of the Polish
Government. Whilst the schedule to the employment contract stated that the
applicant could have been called upon to do other work at the request of the
head of mission, it does not appear from the case file-nor has the Government
provided any details in this connection-that she actually performed any
functions related to the exercise of sovereignty by the Polish State.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its judgment of June
25, 2001 the Supreme Court stated that, in order to determine whether or not it
had jurisdiction to hear employment disputes involving a foreign mission or
embassy, it was necessary to establish in each case whether the employment
relationship in question was one of a public-law nature (<i>acta jure imperii</i>)<i>
</i>or of a private-law nature (<i>acta jure gestionis</i>). In the present
case, however, the Supreme Court found that it had been unable to obtain any
information allowing it to establish the scope of the applicant's ‘actual
duties’. It therefore referred solely to the title of her position, and to the
fact that Poland had invoked immunity from jurisdiction, in concluding that the
duties entrusted to her had ‘facilitated, to a certain degree, the exercise by
the Republic of Poland of its sovereign functions.’”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some further explanation is called for concerning the Strasbourg Court’s
treatment of the ILC’s draft articles of 1991, since it is criticised by Ms Karen
Steyn QC, for the Secretary of State on grounds that I think misunderstand it.
The Court began its observations on this question by noting (para 64) that “the
application of absolute state immunity has, for many years, clearly been
eroded.” This is a reference to the progressive adoption of the restrictive
doctrine. The court treated draft article 11 as reflecting the adoption of the
restrictive doctrine in the domain of employment. As regards the critical parts
of draft article 11, this is plainly correct. The exceptions which were
relevant in Ms Cudak’s case were (a) and (b). Of these, (a) directly imported
the classic distinction between acts <i>jure imperii</i> and acts <i>jure
gestionis</i>. As to (b), the International Law Commission’s commentary on the
draft articles suggested that it “confirmed the existing practice of states” by
which state immunity extended to the recruitment, renewal of employment and
reinstatement of an employee, these being dependent on policy considerations
lying within a state’s discretionary power and likely to have been determined
as an exercise of governmental authority. A substantial body of domestic case law
from various jurisdictions is cited in support of this statement: see <i>Report
of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-third session, 29
April-19 July 1991</i> [A/46/10], pp 43-44, para (10). The Strasbourg court
presumably based its reasoning on the draft articles of 1991 rather than the
final text of the Convention because the relevant proceedings in Lithuania
occurred in 2000 and 2001, before the final text of the Convention was adopted.
But although the final text of article 11 differs in significant respects from
the draft article, exception (a) is substantially the same in the final
version, and exception (b) (renumbered (c)) is identical. The Court was
therefore right to regard these provisions of draft article 11 as applying the
restrictive doctrine of state immunity to contracts of employment, and as
foreshadowing, in that respect, the terms of the Convention. I do not read the
Strasbourg Court as having assumed that everything else in draft article 11 was
declaratory of existing customary international law. It did not need to,
because the other exceptions in article 11(2) did not affect the issue. Ms
Cudak appears to have been a national of or habitually resident in Lithuania,
and there was no contractual submission to the local forum. Exceptions (c), (d)
and (e) therefore did not arise.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span><i>Sabeh El Leil v France</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1055.html">(2012) 54 EHRR 14</a> arose out of another
unfair dismissal claim, this time brought in the French courts by the head of
the accounts department of the Kuwaiti embassy in Paris. In this case, the
final decision of the French courts barring the claim on grounds of state
immunity was handed down after the adoption of the United Nations Convention.
After reiterating the principle on which the Strasbourg court had always held
article 6 to be engaged in such cases, the Grand Chamber summarised its case
law as follows (paras 51-52):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in cases where
the application of the rule of state immunity from jurisdiction restricts the
exercise of the right of access to a court, the Court must ascertain whether
the circumstances of the case justified such restriction.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court further
reiterates that such limitation must pursue a legitimate aim and that state
immunity was developed in international law out of the principle <i>par in
parem non habet imperium, </i>by virtue of which one state could not be subject
to the jurisdiction of another. It has taken the view that the grant of
immunity to a state in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of
complying with international law to promote comity and good relations between
states through the respect of another state's sovereignty.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Court then restated the view which it had taken in <i>Cudak</i>,
that article 11 of the ILC’s draft articles of 1991, “as now enshrined in the
2004 Convention” represented customary international law binding as such even
on those states (such as France) which had not ratified it at the relevant
time. In saying this, the Court must have had in mind exceptions (a) and (b) in
draft article 11(2), since these are the only potentially relevant exceptions
subsequently “enshrined” in the Convention. The rest of article 11(2) in the
final version is very different from the draft. The Court found that article 6
had been violated because the Cour de Cassation had not had regard to customary
international law as embodied in article 11 of the United Nations Convention
and had not given adequate reasons for finding that some of the applicant’s
duties involved participating in exercises of governmental authority.</p>

applied by the Strasbourg court in <i>Wallishauser v Austria</i> (Application
156/04, Judgment of 19 Nov 2012) and <i>Radunović v Montenegro</i>
(Applications 45197/13, 53000/13 and 73404/13, Judgment 25 Oct 2016), all of

</span>The Court of Appeal in the present cases thought that it was
“questionable” whether article 11 of the draft articles was in fact a
definitive statement of customary international law in embassy employment
disputes. For my part, I would agree that some of the Strasbourg court’s
observations about article 11 have simply served to sow confusion. Article 11
codifies customary international law so far as it applies the restrictive
doctrine to contracts of employment. That would have been enough for Ms Cudak’s
and Mr El Leil’s purposes. So far as article 11 goes beyond the application of
the restrictive doctrine, its status is uncertain. I shall expand on this point
below. It would perhaps have been better if the Strasbourg court had simply
said that employment disputes should be dealt with in accordance with the
restrictive doctrine instead of in accordance with an article of a treaty which
is not in force and which a large majority of states have neither signed nor
ratified. But this is a point of presentation, not of substance.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>Ms Steyn for the Secretary of State has raised a threshold issue. She
contends that a decision of a domestic court that a state is entitled to
immunity does not engage article 6 at all, because its effect is that there is
no jurisdiction capable of being exercised and no access to a court capable of
being withheld. As I have pointed out, this is a point which was powerfully
made in the House of Lords in <i>Holland v Lampen-Wolfe </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/40.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1573</a>

was invited to depart from <i>Al-Adsani</i> on this point, but it declined to
do so, adhering to its long-standing distinction between procedural and
substantive bars to the exercise of jurisdiction. Ms Steyn now invites us to
resolve this issue in accordance with the views of the House of Lords.<span class="sb8d990e2"> In my view, there may well come a time when this court has to
choose between the view of the House of Lords and that of the European Court of
Human Rights on this fundamental question. But the premise on which the
question arises is that there is a rule of international law which denies the
English court jurisdiction in the instant case. In both <i>Jones</i> and <i>Lampen-Wolfe</i>,
the Appellate Committee had satisfied itself that there was. I would not be
willing to decide which of the competing views about the implications of a want
of jurisdiction is correct, unless the question actually arose. So the first
question which I shall address is what is the relevant rule of international
law.</span></p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Identifying Customary International Law</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To identify a rule of customary international law, it is necessary to
establish that there is a widespread, representative and consistent practice of
states on the point in question, which is accepted by them on the footing that
it is a legal obligation (<i>opinio juris</i>): see Conclusions 8 and 9 of the
International Law Commission’s <i>Draft Conclusions on Identification of
Customary International Law</i> (2016) [A/71/10]. There has never been any
clearly defined rule about what degree of consensus is required. The editors of
Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law, 8th ed (2012), 24, suggest
that “complete uniformity of practice is not required, but substantial
uniformity is”. This accords with all the authorities. In the words of the
International Court of Justice -</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para31">“The Court does not consider that,
for a rule to be established as customary, the corresponding practice must be
in absolutely rigorous conformity with the rule. In order to deduce the
existence of customary rules, the Court deems it sufficient that the conduct of
States should, in general, be consistent with such rules, and that instances of
State conduct inconsistent with a given rule should generally have been treated
as breaches of that rule, not as indications of the recognition of a new rule”:

<p class="ParaNoNumber">What is clear is that substantial differences of practice
and opinion within the international community upon a given principle are not
consistent with that principle being law: <i>Fisheries Case (United Kingdom v

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In view of the emphasis placed by the European Court of Human Rights on
the United Nations Convention and its antecedent drafts, it is right to point
out that a treaty may have no effect qua treaty but nevertheless represent
customary international law and as such bind non-party states. The
International Law Commission’s <i>Draft Conclusions on Identification of
Customary International Law</i> (2016) [A/71/10], propose as Conclusion 11(1):</a></p><a name="para32">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A rule set forth in a treaty may
reflect a rule of customary international law if it is established that the
treaty rule:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; codified a rule of
customary international law existing at the time when the treaty was concluded;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has led to the
crystallization of a rule of customary international law that had started to
emerge prior to the conclusion of the treaty; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has given rise to a
general practice that is accepted as law (<i>opinio juris</i>)<i> </i>thus
generating a new rule of customary international law.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para32">It would be difficult to say that a treaty such as the
United Nations Convention which has never entered into force had led to the
“crystallisation” of a rule of customary international law that had started to
emerge before it was concluded. For the same reason, it is unlikely that such a
treaty could have “given rise to a general practice that is accepted as law.”
These difficulties are greatly increased in the case of the United Nations
Convention by the consideration that in the 13 years which have passed since it
was adopted and opened for signature it has received so few accessions. The real
significance of the Convention is as a codification of customary international
law. In <span class="sb8d990e2"><i>Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/26.html">[2007] 1 AC 270</a>, Lord Bingham described it
(para 26) as <span class="sb8d990e2">“</span>the most authoritative statement
available on the current international understanding of the limits of state
immunity in civil cases.” However, it is not to be assumed that every part of
the Convention restates customary international law. As its preamble recites,
it was expected to “contribute to the codification and development of
international law and the harmonisation of practice in this area.” Like most
multilateral conventions, its provisions are based partly on existing customary
rules of general acceptance and partly on the resolution of points on which
practice and opinion had previously been diverse. It is therefore necessary to
distinguish between those provisions of the Convention which were essentially
declaratory and those which were legislative in the sense that they sought to
resolve differences rather than to recognise existing consensus. That exercise
would inevitably require one to ascertain how customary law stood before the
treaty.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The margin of appreciation: a “tenable” view</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State’s case is that there is no sufficient consensus
on the application of state immunity to a contract for the employment of
non-diplomatic staff of a foreign diplomatic mission, to found any rule of
customary international law on the point. He submits that two consequences follow
from this. The first is that article 6 of the Human Rights Convention is
satisfied if the rule of the forum state “reflects” generally recognised
principles of international law. For this purpose, it is enough for the forum
state to apply a “tenable” view of what international law is, or at any rate
that its domestic law applies a solution that is not outside the “currently
accepted international standards” treated as a benchmark in <i>Fogarty</i>. He
submits that it is not necessary to show that international law “requires” the
foreign state to be treated as immune. The second consequence is said to be
that in the absence of a rule of customary international law justifying some
other solution, the state employer is entitled to absolute immunity. This is
because, in the Secretary of State’s submission, the restrictive doctrine of
state immunity operates by grafting exceptions onto the principle of absolute
immunity, so that unless and until a relevant exception has achieved the status
of customary international law, the immunity remains unqualified.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I can deal quite shortly with the suggested distinction between
“reflects” and “requires”, for in my opinion it is misconceived. The argument
is based on the observation of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Al-Adsani</i>
(para 56) that “measures taken by a High Contracting Party which <i>reflect</i>
generally recognised rules of public international law” are within a state’s
margin of appreciation. That observation is repeated in most of the subsequent
cases: see <i>Fogarty</i> (para 36), <i>Cudak</i> (para 57), <i>Sabeh El Leil</i>
(para 49). But in my view the distinction proposed by the Secretary of State is
a purely semantic one. International law is relevant to the operation of
article 6 of the Human Rights Convention because, in accordance with article
31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Human Rights
Convention is interpreted in the light of “any relevant rules of international
law applicable in the relations between the parties.” It is therefore necessary
to ask what is the relevant rule of international law by reference to which
article 6 must be interpreted. The relevant rule is that if the foreign state
is immune then, as the International Court of Justice has confirmed in <i>Jurisdictional
Immunities of the State</i>, the forum state is not just entitled but bound to
give effect to that immunity. If the foreign state is not immune, there is no
relevant rule of international law at all. What justifies the denial of access
to a court is the international law obligation of the forum state to give
effect to a justified assertion of immunity. A mere liberty to treat the
foreign state as immune could not have that effect, because in that case the
denial of access would be a discretionary choice on the part of the forum
state: see <i>Al Jedda v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1092.html">(2011) 53 EHRR 23</a>; <i>Nada v
Switzerland</i> (2012) 56 EHRR 593, paras 180, 195; <i>Perincek v Switzerland</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2015/907.html">(2016) 63 EHRR 6</a>, paras 258-259. To put the same point another way, if the
legitimate purpose said to justify denying access to a court is compliance with
international law, anything that goes further in that direction than
international law requires is necessarily disproportionate. I conclude that
unless international law requires the United Kingdom to treat Libya and Sudan
as immune as regards the claims of Ms Janah and Ms Benkharbouche, the denial to
them of access to the courts to adjudicate on their claim violates article 6 of
the Human Rights Convention.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are circumstances in which an English court considering the
international law obligations of the United Kingdom may properly limit itself
to asking whether the United Kingdom has acted on a “tenable” view of those
obligations. A suggestion to this effect by Sir Philip Sales and Joanne
Clement, “International law in domestic courts: the developing framework”
(2008) 124 LQR 388, 405-407 was tentatively endorsed by Lord Brown of
Eaton-under-Heywood in <i>R (Corner House Research) v Serious Fraud Office</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/60.html">[2009] 1 AC 756</a>, at para 68. Thus the court may in principle be reluctant to
decide contentious issues of international law if that would impede the
executive conduct of foreign relations. Or the rationality of a public
authority’s view on a difficult question of international law may depend on
whether its view of international law was tenable, rather than whether it was
right. Both of these points arose in <i>Corner House</i>. Or the court may be
unwilling to pronounce upon an uncertain point of customary international law
which only a consensus of states can resolve. As Lord Hoffmann observed in <i>Jones
v Saudi Arabia</i> (para 63), “it is not for a national court to ‘develop’
international law by unilaterally adopting a version of that law which, however
desirable, forward-looking and reflective of values it may be, is simply not
accepted by other states.” But I decline to treat these examples as pointing to
a more general rule that the English courts should not determine points of
customary international law but only the “tenability” of some particular view
about them. If it is necessary to decide a point of international law in order
to resolve a justiciable issue and there is an ascertainable answer, then the
court is bound to supply that answer. In the present cases, the law requires us
to measure sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) against the requirements of customary
international law, something that we cannot do without deciding what those
requirements are.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not read the Strasbourg court as having said anything very
different in <i>Fogarty</i>. The court considered (para 37) that although there
had been a “trend” in favour of the restrictive doctrine of state immunity,
there was too much diversity of state practice in the specific area of embassy
staff to enable them to say that the restrictive doctrine applied to them. In
those circumstances they thought it sufficient that the United Kingdom had
acted on a view of international law which, although not the only possible one,
was within “currently accepted international standards”. But this is not the
same point as the one made by the Secretary of State, for it applies only if
there is no relevant and identifiable rule of international law. If there is
such a rule, the court must identify it and determine whether it justifies the
application of state immunity. That is what the Strasbourg court did in <i>Cudak</i>
and <i>Sabeh El Leil</i>, and what it criticised the Lithuanian Supreme Court
and the French Court de Cassation for failing to do in those cases. For reasons
which I shall explain, I find the view expressed in <i>Fogarty</i> that there
was no relevant and identifiable rule of international law surprising, but that
is another matter.</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="ParaHeading">The starting point: absolute or restrictive immunity?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fundamental difference between the parties to this appeal concerns
the starting point. On the footing that customary international law must <i>require</i>
the United Kingdom to treat Libya and Sudan as immune, the Secretary of State
submits that it does. This is because in his submission state immunity is
absolute unless the case is brought within an internationally recognised
exception to it. This submission, if it is correct, would considerably broaden
the scope of state immunity in customary international law, by extending it to
any group of claimants about whom there was a diversity of state practice. But
in my view, it is not correct. The rule of customary international law is that
a state is entitled to immunity only in respect of acts done in the exercise of
sovereign authority. In the absence of a special rule to some different effect
applicable to employees in the position of Ms Janah and Ms Benkharbouche, that
is the default position.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the State Immunity Act 1978 adopts the drafting
technique of stating a presumptive immunity subject to exceptions. Section 1
provides that a state is immune except as provided in the following sections of
Part I. The same drafting technique is employed in other national legislation,
especially in common law jurisdictions, for example the United States, Canada
and Australia. As applied to international law, the submission is lent a certain
superficial plausibility by the fact that the United Nations Convention has
adopted the same drafting technique. Article 5 provides for a general immunity
“subject to the provisions of this Convention”. In <i>Jones v Saudi Arabia</i>,
Lord Bingham relied on the way that the United Nations Convention was drafted
as showing that a state was immune in respect of everything that was not the
subject of an express exception, and concluded that the immunity extended to
torture because torture was not the subject of any express exception: see paras
8-9 (Lord Bingham), and cf para 47 (Lord Hoffmann).</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not regard these considerations as decisive of the present issue.
No one doubts that as a matter of domestic law, Part I of the State Immunity
Act is a complete code. If the case does not fall within one of the exceptions
to section 1, the state is immune. But the present question is whether the
immunity thus conferred is wider than customary international law requires, and
that raises different considerations. In the first place, it is necessary to
read the grant of the immunity in article 5 of the United Nations Convention together
with the exceptions which follow, as an organic whole. The exceptions are so
fundamental in their character, so consistent in their objective and so broad
in their effect as to amount in reality to a qualification of the principle of
immunity itself rather than a mere collection of special exceptions. Secondly,
it is important when doing this to distinguish between a drafting technique and
a principle of law. The <i>travaux préparatoires</i> of the United Nations
Convention show that the technique of stating a general rule of immunity
subject to exceptions, was highly contentious. This was partly because it might
be taken as an implicit recognition that absolute immunity was the basic rule,
something which many states did not accept; and partly because it was thought
that it would lead to undue rigidity and thereby impede the future development
of customary international law. These differences are summarised in the <i>Report
of the International Law Commission on the Work of its thirty-eighth session</i>
[A/41/10] ILC Yearbook (1986), ii(2), 16, and in the valuable commentary of
O’Keefe and Tams (ed), <i>The United Nations Convention of Jurisdictional
Immunities of States and their Property</i> (2013), 99-101. It is clear that
the draftsman’s objective was to remain neutral as between the competing
doctrines said to represent the current state of international law. Various
proposals were made with a view to achieving this and avoiding undue rigidity.
In particular, it was proposed that what became article 5 should provide that a
state was immune “subject to the provisions of the present articles [and the
relevant rules of general international law applicable in the matter].” This
provoked much discord, and the bracketed words were ultimately dropped on the
ground that they made no difference. In its commentary on the draft articles of
1991, the International Law Commission explained that this was because</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“it was considered that any
immunity or exception to immunity accorded under the present articles would
have no effect on general international law and would not prejudice the future
development of State practice … Article 5 is also to be understood as the
statement of the principle of State immunity forming the basis of the present draft
articles and does not prejudge the question of the extent to which the
articles, including article 5, should be regarded as codifying the rules of
existing international law.” <i>Draft articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of
States and their Property, with commentaries</i> (1991), 23 (para (3) under
article 5)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Thirdly, as I have already observed, the United Nations
Convention has for the time being no binding effect qua treaty. All that can be
said about it is that so far as it seeks to codify existing customary
international law, it is evidence of what that law is. But even where it is
declaratory, it can never be definitive, if only in order to allow for the
future development of state practice. Hence the fifth recital in its preamble
(“<i>Affirming</i> that the rules of customary law continue to govern matters
not regulated by the provisions of the present Convention”), which was inserted
in the course of the debates about article 11 to which I have referred.
Fourthly, the House of Lords in <i>Jones v Saudi Arabia</i> was not concerned
with the question whether the starting point was absolute or restrictive
immunity. It was concerned with the question whether torture and other breaches
of peremptory norms of international law constituted an implied additional
limitation upon an immunity which was unquestionably recognised by
international law. Without an implied limitation of this kind, a state would
have been immune in international law as regards an allegation of torture under
either the absolute or the restrictive doctrine because, as the House of Lords
held, torture is by definition a governmental act: see paras 16, 19 (Lord
Bingham), and 83-85 (Lord Hoffmann).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The main difficulty about the Secretary of State’s submission is a more
fundamental one, namely that it is not consistent with the way that the law of
state immunity has developed. Unlike diplomatic immunity, which is based mainly
on an international consensus established by writers and governmental practice
over many centuries, state immunity was developed during the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries primarily by municipal courts. In the words of the Special
Rapporteur of the International Law Commission, presenting in 1980 the first
draft of what became the United Nations Convention, their decisions constituted
“a great and divergent volume of municipal jurisprudence”: [A/35/10] ILC <i>Yearbook</i>
(1980), ii(2), 143. Before the age of state trading organisations, there were
few occasions for testing the limits of state immunity. States rarely did acts in
peacetime within the territory of other states, other than conduct diplomatic
relations, and that was the subject of a distinct and far older international
law immunity. Leaving aside the rather special case of the immunity of personal
sovereigns visiting the forum state, the only other acts which a sovereign
performed in the territory of another state involved the presence of
state-owned ships in its ports or the placing of public procurement contracts.
The latter were generally for military or diplomatic purposes, and were
therefore closely related to the inherently governmental acts of the state,
even if they were strictly speaking acts of a private law character.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"><span lang="EN"></span></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The earliest notable landmark was the judgment of the Supreme
Court of the United States in <i>The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon</i> 11 US 116
(1812), delivered by Chief Justice Marshall. The <i>Exchange</i> was a trading
vessel belonging to two American merchants, which was captured at sea by French
ships of war, converted into an armed cruiser and incorporated into the French
navy. When the ship put in to the port of Philadelphia, its former owners
claimed possession. The Supreme Court held that a ship of war in the possession
of a foreign state was immune from any proceedings in rem. Marshall CJ founded
the rule on an implied exception to the territorial sovereignty of states for
certain classes of act done there by a foreign state, which was based on “the
usages and received obligations of the civilised world”. <span lang="EN">At pp
144-145, he drew a distinction between trading vessels and ships of war.</span></a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN">“It may safely be
affirmed that there is a manifest distinction between the private property of
the person who happens to be a prince and that military force which supports
the sovereign power and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation.
A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be
considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction; he may
be considered as so far laying down the prince and assuming the character of a
private individual, but this he cannot be presumed to do with respect to any
portion of that armed force which upholds his Crown and the nation he is entrusted
to govern.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The <i>Exchange</i> was a decision on the immunity of the
property of a foreign state, a context in which the immunities recognised by
international law have generally been wider than those available in actions for
breach of duty. But it will be seen even in that context, at its origins the
immunity was not conceived to be absolute. It was assumed to extend only to
property employed for public or governmental purposes.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same assumption was made in the earliest English cases. In <i>Duke
of Brunswick v King of Hanover</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1848/794.pdf">(1848) 2 HL Cas 1</a> the House of Lords held,
in the words of Lord Chancellor Cottenham (p 17), that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a foreign Sovereign, coming into
this country, cannot be made responsible here for an act done in his sovereign
character in his own country; whether it be an act right or wrong, whether
according to the constitution of that country or not, the Courts of this
country cannot sit in judgment upon an act of a Sovereign, effected by virtue
of his Sovereign authority abroad.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In <i>De Haber v Queen of Portugal</i> (1851) 7 QB 196,
207 Lord Campbell CJ gave it as his opinion that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“an action cannot be maintained in
any English Court against a foreign potentate, for anything done or omitted to
be done by him in his public capacity as representative of the nation of which

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question whether a corresponding immunity applied to a sovereign’s
non-sovereign acts arose for the first time in England in <i>The Charkieh</i>
(1872-5) LR 4 A &amp; E 59, a collision action brought against a ship which
belonged to the Khedive of Egypt and flew the flag of the Ottoman navy, but was
employed for ordinary commercial purposes and at the time was under charter to
a British trading house. Sir Robert Phillimore, sitting in the Admiralty Court,
held that the vessel was not immune because the Khedive was not a sovereign but
an officer of the Ottoman Porte. However, he went on to hold that there would
have been no immunity in any event, because the use of state property for
trading purposes was an implicit waiver of any immunity attaching to the state.
At pp 99-100, he stated that</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“no principle of international
law, and no decided case, and no dictum of jurists of which I am aware, has
gone so far as to authorize a sovereign prince to assume the character of a
trader, when it is for his benefit; and when he incurs an obligation to a
private subject to throw off, if I may so speak, his disguise, and appear as a
sovereign, claiming for his own benefit, and to the injury of a private person,
for the first time, all the attributes of his character.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Six years later, Sir Robert had to deal with the same
issue in <i>The Parlement Belge</i> (1879) 4 PD 129, another collision action
brought against a ship belonging to the Belgian state, which was employed as a
mail packet but also carried some passengers and freight. He followed his own
judgment in <i>The Charkieh</i>, holding that any immunity “would not include a
vessel engaged in commerce, whose owner is (to use the expression of
Bynkershoek, <i>De Leg Mercatore</i>) <i>strenue mercatorem agens</i>.” The
Court of Appeal overruled this decision. The judgment of the court (delivered
by Brett LJ) was authority for two points. The first, which was technically <i>obiter
dictum</i>, was that by extension from the personal immunity of an ambassador,
which at that time was absolute, the courts could not exercise any jurisdiction
in personam against a sovereign. The second, which was the ratio of the
decision, was that immunity extended to proceedings in rem against “the public
property of any state which is destined to public use”. The ground on which the
appeal was allowed was that the vessel was employed substantially for public
purposes as a mail packet. The court declined to decide whether it would have
been immune if it had been used wholly or substantially for ordinary trading.
It was enough that the incidental carriage of passengers and freight did not
deprive Belgium of the immunity to which the substantially public purpose of
its operations entitled it. Cf the analysis of the decision by Lord Cross of
Chelsea, delivering the advice of the Privy Council in <i>The Philippine
Admiral</i> [1977] AC 377, 391-392.</p>

</span>Nonetheless, the <i>Parlement Belge</i> was for many years regarded as
authority for the absolute immunity of state property. The extreme point of
this tendency was reached with the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>The
Porto Alexandre</i> [1920] P 30. In that case there was no suggestion that the
vessel was in use for any public purpose. She was engaged in ordinary trading
operations. But the <i>Parlement Belge</i> was treated as warranting the
absolute immunity of state-owned ships from actions in rem. The decision
provoked controversy well before the Privy Council held in <i>The Philippine
Admiral</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1975/1975_21.html">[1977] AC 373</a> that it had been wrongly decided. In <i>Compania
Naviera Vascongada v Steamship Cristina (The Cristina)</i> [1938] AC 485, a
Spanish trading ship had been requisitioned by the Spanish government while on
the high seas in order to assist the republican government of Spain to put down
the nationalist rebellion. Possession of her had then been taken in the port of
Cardiff by the Spanish consul there. The speeches need to be read in
conjunction with the fuller account of the facts and arguments which are
reported at (1938) 60 Lloyd’s Rep 147. It was not in doubt that the Spanish
consul had taken possession of it for public purposes. The real issues were
whether an action in rem against a state-owned ship impleaded the foreign
state; and whether the English courts should recognise an extraterritorial
decree of the Spanish state. The House of Lords rejected the argument about the
extraterritorial operation of the decree, and dismissed the action on the
ground (i) that an action in rem against a state-owned ship indirectly
impleaded the state, or indeed (per Lord Wright, at p 505) directly impleaded
it; and (ii) that however she had previously been employed by her owners, she
was intended for public purposes in the hands of the Spanish government. An
action for possession could not therefore proceed. The interest of the case for
present purposes lies in the divergence of views about the <i>Porto Alexandre</i>.
Lord Atkin and Lord Wright considered that the immunity of states was absolute
and applied irrespective of the purpose for which a ship was in the state’s
possession. But the other members of the Appellate Committee doubted this,
primarily on the ground that it could be correct only if there was a sufficient
international consensus to that effect. However, no attempt had been made in
the earlier cases to establish that there was. Lord Thankerton observed (pp
495-496) that it “may be argued” that the judgment of Brett LJ in the <i>Parlement
Belge</i> did not authorise the extension of state immunity to property in
commercial use since proceedings against such property were “not to be regarded
as inconsistent with the independence and equality of the state represented by
such owner.” He pointed out that the Court of Appeal in the <i>Porto Alexandre</i>
had “made no inquiry as to whether such an exemption was generally agreed to by
the nations, and it seems to be common knowledge that they have not so agreed.”
Lord Macmillan shared these doubts, remarking at p 498:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I confess that I should hesitate
to lay down that it is part of the law of England that an ordinary foreign
trading vessel is immune from civil process within this realm by reason merely
of the fact that it is owned by a foreign State, for such a principle must be
an importation from international law and there is no proved consensus of
international opinion or practice to this effect. On the contrary the subject
is one on which divergent views exist and have been expressed among the
nations. When the doctrine of the immunity of the person and property of
foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction of the Courts of this country was
first formulated and accepted it was a concession to the dignity, equality and
independence of foreign sovereigns which the comity of nations enjoined. It is
only in modern times that sovereign States have so far condescended to lay
aside their dignity as to enter the competitive markets of commerce, and it is
easy to see that different views may be taken as to whether an immunity
conceded in one set of circumstances should to the same extent be enjoyed in
totally different circumstances.”</p>

</span>The doubts expressed in <i>The Cristina</i> by Lord Thankerton, Lord
Macmillan and Lord Maugham about the international law basis for a rule of
absolute immunity were justified, as a review of pre-1945 decisions in
different jurisdictions demonstrates. For what follows, I am indebted to the
extensive reviews of this large body of material by Sir Hersch Lauterpacht in
his influential article <span class="citetitle"><span lang="EN-US">“The Problem of
Jurisdictional Immunities of Foreign States”, </span></span><span lang="EN-US">28
BYIL (1951), 220</span>, 250-272, by the German Bundesverfassungsgericht in <i>Claim

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Broadly speaking, these show that states which adopted the absolute
doctrine of state immunity generally did so on one or other of two grounds. One
was that the sovereign equality of states implied an entire absence of
jurisdiction by the courts on one state over another. The other was that while
there was in principle a distinction between the public and private acts of a state,
the distinction should depend on the state’s purpose in doing the relevant act
and not on its juridical character, so that even trading activities were immune
if they were carried on in the public interest. The two approaches are very
different but in practice they lead to the same result, except perhaps in the
case of the private acts of personal sovereigns.</a></p><a name="para47">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As far as the common law world is concerned, the English courts, after a
period of hesitation, finally opted for the first analysis. In British dependencies
and dominions, the absolute doctrine of state immunity was generally adopted in
line with what was assumed to have been laid down in <i>The Parlement Belge</i>.
In the United States, the absolute doctrine had a more chequered history, but
it ultimately adopted the second analysis. The State Department’s traditional
approach to the question of state-owned ships was described in a communication
addressed by the Secretary of State to the Attorney General in 1918, stating
that “where [state-owned] vessels were engaged in commercial pursuits, they
should be subject to the obligations and restrictions of trade, if they were to
enjoy the benefits and profits.” Instructions to this effect were given to
United States diplomatic and consular officers abroad: see Hackworth, <i>Digest
of International Law</i>, ii (1941), 429, 439-440. This only changed with the
decision of the United States Supreme Court in <i>Berizzi Brothers Co v
Steamship Pesaro</i>, </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1926/159.html">271 US 562</a> (1926), an action in rem in support of a cargo
claim against a trading vessel owned by the Italian state. The State Department
had refused, in accordance with its traditional practice, to certify that the
ship was immune, on the ground that “vessels owned by a state and engaged in
commerce are not entitled, within the territorial waters of another state, to
the immunity accorded to vessels of war, and that notwithstanding such
ownership these vessels are subject to the local jurisdiction to the same
extent as other merchant vessels”: Hackworth, <i>op cit</i>, ii, 437. But the
Supreme Court upheld the claim to immunity. The Court adopted <i>The Parlement
Belge</i>, as it had been interpreted in subsequent English case law, including
<i>The Porto Alexandre</i>. It accepted in principle the distinction between
ships operated for public and private purposes which dated back to <i>The
Schooner Exchange v McFaddon</i>. But it largely emptied it of substance by
applying it according to the state’s purpose in doing the act. As Van Devanter
J put it, at p 574,</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN">“when, for the
purpose of advancing the trade of its people or providing revenue for its
treasury, a government acquires, mans, and operates ships in the carrying
trade, they are public ships in the same sense that war ships are. We know of
no international usage which regards the maintenance and advancement of the
economic welfare of a people in time of peace of any less a public purpose than
the maintenance and training of a naval force.”</span></p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This settled the position for some twenty years as far as
claims for state immunity in the United States courts were concerned. But, as
the State Department recorded in the Tate Letter of 1952 ((1952) 26 Department
of State Bulletin, 984-985), it maintained its long-standing practice of not
asserting immunity in foreign courts in proceedings alleging ordinary
contractual or tortious liability against the United States.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The position in civil law countries was highly diverse. In France, the
absolute doctrine was endorsed by the Cour de Cassation in its celebrated
decision in <i>Lambège et Pujol v Etat d’Espagne</i>, 22 Jan 1849, Dalloz
(1849), i, 5. But the principle was not consistently applied in its absolute
form, and a series of decisions in the first half of the 20th century appeared
to recognise a distinction between the public and private law functions of
states: see Dunbar, <i>art cit</i>, 212-218. The absolute doctrine was
consistently applied until recent times in Spain, Portugal and Japan, but less
consistently in Germany and the Netherlands and not at all in Switzerland. It
has never been recognised in Italy or Belgium, whose highest courts were among
the first to adopt the restrictive doctrine in a recognisably modern form. As
early as 1886, the Italian Corte di Cassazione justified its position by
observing:</a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:72.0pt">“No one can deny that the foundation of international law
is the sovereignty and independence of states; and that in consequence of this
principle each state, in the exercise of its powers, is exempted from the
jurisdiction of other states. But the fallacy consists in considering the state
exclusively and always as a body politic, although its activity as a civil
entity cannot be gainsaid when it performs acts acquiring rights and assuming
obligations in private relationships, like any other physical or juristic
person being capable of exercising civil rights.” <i>Typaldos, Console di
Grecia v Manicmio di Aversa</i>, Giurisprundenzia Italiana (1886), I, 228, 229.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Belgian Cour de Cassation, after some three decades
in which the restrictive doctrine had been applied by the lower courts, adopted
it in <i>SA des Chemins de Fer Liégeois-Luxembourgeois v Etat Néerlandais</i>,
Pasicrisie Belge (1903), ii, 294, 301-302 for very similar reasons.</p>

</span>Looking at the position in the years immediately following the second
world war, Sir Hersch Lauterpacht concluded that the common assumption that the
majority of states were wedded to the doctrine of absolute state immunity was
inaccurate. On the contrary, “in the great majority of states in which there is
an articulate practice on the subject, courts have declined to follow the principle
of absolute immunity” (pp 250-251). It followed, that “so far as the actual
practice of states may be said to be evidence of customary international law,
there is no doubt that the principle of absolute immunity forms no part of
international custom” (p 221). Thirty-five years later the International Law
Commission, reporting to the United Nations General Assembly on the
difficulties which it had encountered in formulating a basic principle of state
immunity, expressed the same view:</a></p><a name="para50">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is common agreement that,
for acts performed in the exercise of the <i>prerogatives de la puissance
publique </i>or ‘sovereign authority of the State’, there is undisputed
immunity. Beyond or around that hard core of immunity, however, there appears
to be a grey zone in which opinions and existing case law, and indeed
legislations, still vary.” <i>Report of the International Law Commission on the
Work of its thirty eighth session</i> [A/41/10] ILC Yearbook (1986), ii(2), 16.</p>

</span>The story of the progressive adoption of the restrictive doctrine of
state immunity in the past 70 years is well known and can be shortly
summarised. The main impetus for this was the growing significance of state
trading organisations in international trade. The critical moment was the
formal adoption (or readoption) of the restrictive doctrine by the United
States government in the Tate Letter, addressed by the legal adviser to the
State Department to the Acting Attorney General on 19 May 1952. After reciting
the adoption of the restrictive doctrine by a growing number of states, it
stated the intention of the executive to act on it. “The <span lang="EN">widespread
and increasing practice on the part of governments of engaging in commercial
activities,” it observed, “makes necessary a practice which will enable persons
doing business with them to have their rights determined in the courts”: <i>loc
cit</i>, 985.</span> Following the Tate Letter, the restrictive doctrine was
generally adopted by Federal Courts, a development which was ultimately approved
by the Supreme Court in <i>Alfred Dunhill of London Inc v Republic of Cuba</i>,
</a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1976/83.html">425 US 682</a>, 701-703 (1976). In Europe, the main landmark was the adoption by
the German Bundesverfassungsgericht of the restrictive theory in 1963, and its
acceptance that the distinction between acts <i>jure imperii </i>and<i> jure
gestionis </i>depended on the juridical character of the act, not the purpose
of the state in doing it: <i>Claim against the Empire of Iran</i> (1963) 45 ILR
257. The courts of the United Kingdom, followed suit in the 1970s. Today, the
international consensus in favour of the restrictive doctrine is almost
complete. While there are a few states whose domestic position is unclear, with
the legislative adoption of the restrictive doctrine by Russia in 2015, the
only notable state still to adhere to the absolute doctrine is China.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Three points can be derived from this history. The first is that there
has probably never been a sufficient international consensus in favour of the
absolute doctrine of immunity to warrant treating it as a rule of customary
international law. All that can be said is that during certain periods, a
substantial number of states, but not necessarily a majority, have adopted the
absolute doctrine as part of their domestic law. Some of them have done so on
the assumption that it represented international law, but without any real
investigation of the rule recognised in other states. Secondly, while there has
for at least two centuries been a consensus among nations in favour of some
form of state immunity, the only consensus that there has ever been about the
scope of that immunity is the consensus in favour of the restrictive doctrine.
Thirdly, the adoption of the restrictive doctrine has not proceeded by
accumulating exceptions to the absolute doctrine. What has happened is that
governments, courts and writers of authority have been prompted by the widening
scope of state operations and their extension into commerce and industry, to
re-examine the true basis of a doctrine originally formulated at a time when
states by and large confined their operations in other countries to the classic
exercises of sovereign authority. The true basis of the doctrine was and is the
equality of sovereigns, and that never did warrant immunity extending beyond
what sovereigns did in their capacity as such. As Lord Wilberforce put it in <i>The
I Congreso del Partido</i> [1983] 1 AC 244, 262,</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is necessary to start from
first principle. The basis upon which one state is considered to be immune from
the territorial jurisdiction of the courts of another state is that of ‘par in
parem’, which effectively means that the sovereign or governmental acts of one
state are not matters upon which the courts of other states will adjudicate.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Application to contracts of employment</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of customary international law, if an employment&nbsp; claim
arises out of an inherently sovereign or governmental act of the foreign state,
the latter is immune. It is not always easy to determine which aspects of the
facts giving rise to the claim are decisive of its correct categorisation, and
the courts have understandably avoided over-precise prescription. The most
satisfactory general statement is that of Lord Wilberforce in <i>The I Congreso
del Partido</i>, at 267:</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The conclusion which emerges is
that in considering, under the ‘restrictive’ theory whether state immunity
should be granted or not, the court must consider the whole context in which
the claim against the state is made, with a view to deciding whether the
relevant act(s) upon which the claim is based, should, in that context, be
considered as fairly within an area of activity, trading or commercial, or
otherwise of a private law character, in which the state has chosen to engage,
or whether the relevant act(s) should be considered as having been done outside
that area, and within the sphere of governmental or sovereign activity.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the great majority of cases arising from contract, including
employment cases, the categorisation will depend on the nature of the
relationship between the parties to which the contract gives rise. This will in
turn depend on the functions which the employee is employed to perform.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations divides the staff of a
diplomatic mission into three broad categories: (i) diplomatic agents, ie the head
of mission and the diplomatic staff; (ii) administrative and technical staff;
and (iii) staff in the domestic service of the mission. Diplomatic agents
participate in the functions of a diplomatic mission defined in article 3,
principally representing the sending state, protecting the interests of the
sending state and its nationals, negotiating with the government of the
receiving state, ascertaining and reporting on developments in the receiving
state and promoting friendly relations with the receiving state. These
functions are inherently governmental. They are exercises of sovereign
authority. Every aspect of the employment of a diplomatic agent is therefore
likely to be an exercise of sovereign authority. The role of technical and
administrative staff is by comparison essentially ancillary and supportive. It
may well be that the employment of some of them might also be exercises of
sovereign authority if their functions are sufficiently close to the
governmental functions of the mission. Cypher clerks might arguably be an
example. Certain confidential secretarial staff might be another: see <i>Governor
of Pitcairn v Sutton</i> (1994) 104 ILR 508 (New Zealand Court of Appeal).
However, I find it difficult to conceive of cases where the employment of
purely domestic staff of a diplomatic mission could be anything other than an
act <i>jure gestionis</i>. The employment of such staff is not inherently
governmental. It is an act of a private law character such as anyone with the
necessary resources might do.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach is supported by the case law of the European Court of
Human Rights, which I have already summarised. In<i> Cudak</i>,<i> Sabeh El
Leil</i>,<i> Wallishauser</i> and<i> Radunović</i>, all cases concerning
the administrative and technical staff of diplomatic missions, the test applied
by the Strasbourg Court was whether the functions for which the applicant was
employed called for a personal involvement in the diplomatic or political
operations of the mission, or only in such activities as might be carried on by
private persons. In <i>Mahamdia v People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria</i>
(Case C-154/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C15411.html">[2013] ICR 1</a>, para 55-57, the Court of Justice of the European
Union applied the same test, holding that the state is not immune “where the
functions carried out by the employee do not fall within the exercise of public
powers.” The United States decisions are particularly instructive, because the
Foreign State Immunity Act of the United States has no special provisions for
contracts of employment. They therefore fall to be dealt with under the general
provisions relating to commercial transactions, which have been interpreted as
confining state immunity to exercises of sovereign authority: see <i>Saudi
Arabia v Nelson</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1993/33.html">507 US 349</a>, 360 (1993). The principle now applied in all
circuits that have addressed the question is that a state is immune as regards
proceedings relating to a contract of employment only if the act of employing
the plaintiff is to be regarded as an exercise of sovereign authority having regard
to his or her participation in the diplomatic functions of the mission: <i>Segni
v Commercial Office of Spain</i> 835 F 2d 160, 165 (7th Cir, 1987), <i>Holden v
Canadian Consulate</i> 92 F 3d 918 (9th Cir, 1996). Although a foreign state
may in practice be more likely to employ its nationals in those functions,
nationality is in itself irrelevant to the characterisation: <i>El-Hadad v
United Arab Emirates</i> 216 F 3d 29 (DC Cir, 2000), at 4, 5. In <i>Park v Shin</i>
313 F 3d 1138 (9th Cir, 2002), paras 12-14, it was held that “the act of hiring
a domestic servant is not an inherently public act that only a government could
perform”, even if her functions include serving at diplomatic entertainments. A
very similar principle has been consistently applied in recent decisions of the
French Cour de Cassation: <i>Barrandon v United States of America</i>, 116 ILR
622 (1998), <i>Coco v Argentina </i>113 ILR 491 (1996), <i>Saignie v Embassy of
Japan </i>113 ILR 492 (1997). In the last-named case, at p 493, the court
observed that the employee, a caretaker at the premises of the mission, had not
had “any special responsibility for the performance of the public service of
the embassy.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would, however, wish to guard against the suggestion that the
character of the employment is always and necessarily decisive. Two points
should be made, albeit briefly since neither is critical to this appeal.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first is that a state’s immunity under the restrictive doctrine may
extend to some aspects of its treatment of its employees or potential employees
which engage the state’s sovereign interests, even if the contract of
employment itself was not entered into in the exercise of sovereign authority.
Examples include claims arising out of an employee’s dismissal for reasons of
state security. They may also include claims arising out of a state’s
recruitment policy for civil servants or diplomatic or military employees, or
claims for specific reinstatement after a dismissal, which in the nature of
things impinge on the state’s recruitment policy. These particular examples are
all reflected in the United Nations Convention and were extensively discussed
in the preparatory sessions of the International Law Commission. They are
certainly not exhaustive. <i>In re Canada Labour Code</i> [1992] 2 SCR 50,
concerned the employment of civilian tradesmen at a US military base in Canada.
The Supreme Court of Canada held that while a contract of employment for work
not involving participation in the sovereign functions of the state was in
principle a contract of a private law nature, particular aspects of the
employment relationship might be immune as arising from inherently governmental
considerations, for example the introduction of a no-strike clause deemed to be
essential to the military efficiency of the base. In these cases, it can be
difficult to distinguish between the purpose and the legal character of the
relevant acts of the foreign state. But as La Forest J pointed out (p 70), in
this context the state’s purpose in doing the act may be relevant, not in
itself, but as an indication of the act’s juridical character.</a></p><a name="para58">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second point to be made is that the territorial connections between
the claimant on the one hand and the foreign or forum state on the other can
never be entirely irrelevant, even though they have no bearing on the classic
distinction between acts done <i>jure imperii</i> and <i>jure gestionis</i>.
This is because the core principle of international law is that sovereignty is
territorial and state immunity is an exception to that principle. As the
International Court of Justice observed in <i>Jurisdictional Immunities of the
State</i>, at para 57, the principle of state immunity</a></p><a name="para59">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“has to be viewed together with
the principle that each State possesses sovereignty over its own territory and
that there flows from that sovereignty the jurisdiction of the State over
events and persons within that territory. Exceptions to the immunity of the
State represent a departure from the principle of sovereign equality. Immunity
may represent a departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the
jurisdiction which flows from it.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The whole subject of the territorial connections of a
non-state contracting party with the foreign or the forum state raises
questions of exceptional sensitivity in the context of employment disputes.
There is a substantial body of international opinion to the effect that the
immunity should extend to a state’s contracts with its own nationals
irrespective of their status or functions even if the work falls to be
performed in the forum state; and correspondingly that it should not extend to
staff recruited from the local labour force in whose protection the forum state
has a governmental interest of its own. Both propositions received substantial
support in the preparatory sessions leading to the United Nations Convention
and were reflected in the final text of article 11. Both receive a measure of
recognition in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which carefully
distinguishes between the measure of immunity accorded to the staff of a
diplomatic mission according to whether they are nationals of the foreign state
or nationals or permanent residents of the forum state: see articles, 33.2, 37,
38, 39.4 and 44. In a practical sense, it might be thought reasonable that a
contract between a state and one of its own nationals should have to be
litigated in the courts of that state under its laws, but unreasonable that the
same should apply to locally recruited staff. There is, however, only limited
international consensus on where the boundaries lie between the respective
territorial responsibilities of the foreign and the forum state, and on how far
the territorial principle can displace the rule which confers immunity on acts <i>jure
imperii</i> but not on acts <i>jure gestionis</i>. I shall expand on this point
below, in the context of section 4 of the State Immunity Act, which is largely
based on the territorial principle.</p>

</span>At the time when the State Immunity Act was enacted, the application of
state immunity to contracts of employment had only lately emerged as a
potential problem. States had traditionally recruited the staff of diplomatic
and representative missions at home. The employment of locally recruited staff
in significant numbers was a recent development. The European Convention on
State Immunity was one of the first international instruments to make special
provision for contracts of employment, which would otherwise have fallen to be
dealt with under the general principles of customary international law relating
to state immunity.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There was, however, no consistency of state practice capable of founding
a special rule of customary international law governing employment. This was
recognised during the preparatory sessions of the International Law Commission
relating to jurisdictional immunities of states. The working group reviewing
the Commission’s draft articles of 1991 observed in 1999:</a></p><a name="para61">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it has been
argued that there are no universally accepted international law principles
regulating the position of employees of foreign States, relevant case law has
often considered a contract of employment as merely a special type of
commercial/private law contract.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, it is
important to distinguish between those States whose law on sovereign immunities
makes a specific provision for contracts of employment and those States where
it does not or which have no statute on the subject. In the latter cases, it is
necessary to analyse the contract of employment as a commercial or private law
contract, whereas in the former case, the only question is whether the contract
of employment falls within the relevant provisions.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key concern has been
to balance the sovereignty of States with the interests of justice involved
when an individual enters into a transaction with a State. One way of achieving
this balance has been to stress a distinction between acts that are sovereign,
public or governmental in character as against acts that are commercial or
private in character …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immunity has generally
been granted in respect of the employment of persons at diplomatic or consular
posts whose work involves the exercise of governmental authority.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cases examined
indicate a tendency for courts to find that they have the jurisdiction to hear
disputes relating to employment contracts, where the employment mirrors employment
in the private sector. However, there has also been recognition that some
employment based on such contracts involves governmental activities by the
employees and, in such circumstances, courts have been prepared to grant
immunity.”</p>

</span>The <i>travaux</i> leading to article 11 of the United Nations
Convention contain no suggestion that existing state practice supported a
special rule of international law concerning employment claims, extending
beyond the immunity attaching to sovereign acts. On the contrary, it is clear
from both the <i>travaux</i> themselves and the impressive body of legal
materials assembled by the parties to this appeal that, while many states
assert a special jurisdiction over employment disputes extending to the
employees of foreign states, there is considerable diversity in this area. The
ILC’s Special Rapporteur reported in 1983 (<i>ILC Yearbook</i> (1983), ii(1),
34-8 [A/CN.4/363]) that:</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the current practice of States
with regard to contracts of employment can offer no greater comfort nor
absolute proof approaching a universal or uniform State practice. It only
indicates a deeper intrusion into a darker or greyer zone of greater
controversy.” (para 39)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The most that could be said was that</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“All things considered, an emerging
trend appears to favour the application of local labour law in regard to
recruitment of the available labour force within a country, and consequently to
encourage the exercise of territorial jurisdiction at the expense of
jurisdictional immunities of foreign States.” (para 60)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The result is that the State Immunity Act 1978 can be regarded as giving
effect to customary international law only so far as it distinguishes between
exercises of sovereign authority and acts of a private law character, and requires
immunity to be conferred on the former but not the latter. There is no basis in
customary international law for the application of state immunity in an
employment context to acts of a private law character.</a></p><a name="para63">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the terms of the Act, contracts of employment are excluded from
the ambit of section 3, which applies the distinction between sovereign acts
and acts of a private law character to other contracts for the supply of
services. Section 4 by comparison identifies those contracts of employment which
attract immunity by reference to the respective connections between the
contract or the employee and the two states concerned. In principle, immunity
does not attach to employment in the local labour market, ie where the contract
was made in the United Kingdom or the work fell to be performed there: see section
4(1). However, this is subject to sections 4(2)(a) and (b), which are concerned
with the employee’s connections by nationality or residence with the foreign
state (section 4(2)(a)) or the forum state (section 4(2)(b)). Section 4(2)(a)
extends the immunity to claims against the employing state by its own
nationals. As I have said, this may have a sound basis in customary
international law, but does not arise here. Section 4(2)(b) extends it to claims
brought by nationals or habitual residents of third countries. Both subsections
apply irrespective of the sovereign character of the relevant act of the
foreign state.</a></p><a name="para64">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sections 4(2)(a) and (b) are derived from article 5.2(a) and (b) of the
European Convention on State Immunity. Like section 4 of the Act, article 5 of
the Convention deals with contracts of employment without reference to the
distinction between acts <i>jure imperii</i> and <i>jure gestionis</i> which
are the basis of the restrictive doctrine of immunity. Contractual submission
apart, the availability of state immunity in answer to employment claims is
made to depend entirely on the location of the work and the respective
territorial connections between the employee on the one hand and the foreign
state or the forum state on the other. The explanatory report submitted to the
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe justified this on the ground
that “the links between the employee and the employing State (in whose courts
the employee may always bring proceedings), are generally closer than those
between the employee and the State of the forum.”</a></p><a name="para65">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The United Kingdom is not unique in applying this principle. Seven other
European countries are party to the European Convention on State Immunity and
six other countries have enacted legislation containing provisions similar to
section 4(2) of the United Kingdom Act. But this is hardly a sufficient basis
on which to identify a widespread, representative and consistent practice of
states, let alone to establish that such a practice is accepted on the footing
that it is an international obligation. The considerable body of comparative
law material before us suggests that unless constrained by a statutory rule the
general practice of states is to apply the classic distinction between acts <i>jure
imperii</i> and <i>jure gestionis</i>, irrespective of the nationality or
residence of the claimant. Indeed, the courts of a significant number of
jurisdictions have refused to apply the immunity as between states which are
not both party to the Convention, unless they performed functions directly
related to the exercise of the state’s sovereign authority, on the ground that
the requirements of general international law differed on this point from those
of the Convention: see <i>French Consular Employee Claim </i>(1989) 86 ILR 583
(Supreme Court, Austria); <i>British Consulate-General in Naples v Toglia </i>(1989)

</span>I conclude that section 4(2)(b) of the State Immunity Act 1978 is not
justified by any binding principle of international law.</a></p><a name="para67">

</span>The Secretary of State has an alternative argument to the effect that section
4(2)(b) may be justifiable as an application of purely domestic policy, on the
ground that the United Kingdom’s interest in asserting the jurisdiction of its
own courts over the employment of the local labour force does not extend to
nationals or residents of third countries. I reject this argument. On the
footing that international law does not require a state to be given immunity, I
do not see how the absence of British nationality or residence at the time of
the contract can be a proper ground for denying an employee access to the
courts in respect of their employment in the United Kingdom. They have no
territorial connection with their employer, other than that which is implicit
in the employment relationship itself. The fact that they may have had no
connection with the United Kingdom either before they came to work here does
not prevent them from being part of the domestic labour force afterwards. Nor
do I accept that the only relevant interest for this purpose is that of the
United Kingdom state. The forum state has duties as well as rights, and as a
matter of domestic policy they extend to the protection of those lawfully
living and employed in the United Kingdom.</a></p><a name="para68">

</span>Since section 16(1)(a) extends state immunity to the claims of any
employee of a diplomatic mission, irrespective of the sovereign character of
the employment or the acts of the state complained of, it is plain that it
cannot be justified by reference to any general principle of immunity based on
the restrictive doctrine. It could be justified only if there were a special
rule, in effect an absolute immunity, applicable to embassy staff. I have
already pointed out, in the context of section 4(2)(b), that in jurisdictions
where the courts determine claims to immunity by reference to customary
international law, the test is whether the relevant acts of the state were
exercises of sovereign authority. The analysis need not be repeated here. It is
inconsistent with any suggestion that immunity can attach to all embassy staff as
such.</a></p><a name="para69">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State submits that there is indeed a special rule
applicable to embassy staff. He says that such a rule is implicit in the
international obligations of the United Kingdom under the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations, the European Convention on State Immunity, and the state
of customary international law reflected in the United Nations Convention. The
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations has been ratified by almost every
state in the world and may for practical purposes be taken to represent a
universally binding standard in international law. Article 7 provides that a
sending state may “freely appoint” members of the staff of a diplomatic
mission. The staff referred to include the technical, administrative and
domestic staff as well as the diplomatic staff: see article 1. The argument is
that the freedom to appoint embassy staff must imply a freedom to dismiss them.
Article 32 of the European Convention on State Immunity and article 3.1 of the
United Nations Convention both provide that they are not to prejudice the
privileges and immunities of a state in relation to the exercise of the
functions of its diplomatic missions and persons connected with them. In my
opinion, however, article 7 of the Vienna Convention has only a limited bearing
on the application of state immunity to employment claims by embassy staff. I
would accept that the right freely to appoint embassy staff means that a court
of the forum state may not make an order which determines who is to be employed
by the diplomatic mission of a foreign state. Therefore, it may not
specifically enforce a contract of employment with a foreign embassy or make a
reinstatement order in favour of an employee who has been dismissed. But a
claim for damages for wrongful dismissal does not require the foreign state to
employ any one. It merely adjusts the financial consequences of dismissal. No
right of the foreign state under the Vienna Convention is infringed by the
assertion of jurisdiction in the forum state to carry out that adjustment.
Therefore, no right under the Vienna Convention would be prejudiced by the
refusal of the forum state to recognise the immunity of the foreign state as
regards a claim for damages.</a></p><a name="para70">

</span>In general, article 11 adheres to the restrictive doctrine, confining
the immunity in employment disputes to cases where the making of the contract
or the acts giving rise to the complaint were exercises of sovereign authority,
or the dispute is between a state and one of its own nationals. Article 11.2(b)
of the United Nations Convention lists four categories of employee whose claims
will attract immunity. The first three categories are diplomatic or consular
staff whose functions would normally be regarded as inherently governmental.
But the fourth category comprises “any other person enjoying diplomatic
immunity.” Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all members of
the staff of a mission who are not nationals of or permanently resident in the
receiving state enjoy diplomatic immunity, including (in respect of acts
performed in the course of their duties) domestic staff: see article 37(3). On
the face of it, therefore, this provision applies state immunity to all claims
by embassy staff at whatever level and irrespective of the juridical character
of the acts giving rise to the dispute. The Court of Appeal, adopting a
suggestion in O’Keefe and Tams (ed), <i>The United Nations Convention of
Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property. A Commentary</i> (2013),
201-2, have held that it could not have meant this in the light of the <i>travaux
preparatoires</i>. These do not explain how article 11.2(b) came to assume its
final form. But they do show that the working groups and committees of the
International Law Commission intended to limit the immunity to the employment
of diplomatic agents. It was suggested to us that sub-paragraph (iv) might also
have been intended to cover diplomats at international conferences, and there
are passages in the <i>travaux</i> which support that view: see, in particular,
<i>Report of the ILC Working Group on Jurisdictional Immunities of States, ILC
Yearbook</i> (1999), ii(2), para 105. But since both of these categories are
already covered by article 11(2)(b)(i) and (iii), and the language of (iv) is
unequivocal, I doubt whether these suggestions can be supported. It is,
however, unnecessary to decide the point, because it is in my view clear that
if article 11(2)(b)(iv) means what it says, it is legislative rather than declaratory
of existing international law. It may one day bind states qua treaty. It may
come to represent customary international law if and when the Convention
attracts sufficient support. But it does not do either of these things as
matters presently stand.</a></p><a name="para72">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are judicial decisions in which the court, while limiting the
immunity to exercises of sovereign authority, has taken an expansive view of
the range of acts relating to an embassy employee which can be so described. <i>Sengupta
v Republic of India</i> [1983] ICR 221 was a decision of the Employment Appeal
Tribunal under the common law in force before the passing of the State Immunity
Act 1978. The Tribunal held that state immunity attached to a claim for the
unfair dismissal of an employee of the Indian High Commission in London. He was
employed at what Browne-Wilkinson J, delivering the judgment of the court,
described (p 223) as “the lowest clerical level”. He was essentially
responsible for collating press cuttings. The tribunal’s reasons appear from pp
228-229 of the judgment:</a></p><a name="para73">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“When one looks to see what is
involved in the performance of the applicant’s contract, it is clear that the
performance of the contract is part of the discharge by the foreign state of
its sovereign functions in which the applicant himself, at however lowly a
level, is under the terms of his contract of employment necessarily engaged.
One of the classic forms of sovereign acts by a foreign state is the
representation of that state in a receiving state … A contract to work at a
diplomatic mission in the work of that mission is a contract to participate in
the public acts of the foreign sovereign. The dismissal of the applicant was an
act done in pursuance of that public function, ie the running of the mission.
As a consequence, the fairness of any dismissal from such employment is very
likely to involve an investigation by the industrial tribunal into the internal
management of the diplomatic representation in the United Kingdom of the
Republic of India, an investigation wholly inconsistent with the dignity of the
foreign state and an interference with its sovereign functions.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">A very similar view was taken in <i>Government of Canada
v Employment Appeals Tribunal and Burke</i> (1992) 95 ILR 467, 500 where the
Irish Supreme Court, applying the common law in the absence of any domestic
legislation in Ireland, held that the services of a chauffeur employed by the
Canadian embassy in Dublin were sufficiently related to the diplomatic
functions of the embassy to make Canada immune from suit. O’Flaherty J,
delivering the judgment of the majority, said (p 500) that “prima facie
anything to do with the embassy is within the public domain of the government
in question.” There have been occasional decisions to the same effect in other
jurisdictions: see, for example, <i>Heusala v Turkey</i> (1993) Oxf Rep Int L
(ILDC 576) (Supreme Court, Finland); <i>A v B</i> (2004) Oxf Rep Int L (ILDC
23) (Supreme Court, Norway). These decisions amount to saying that the
employment of embassy staff is inherently governmental notwithstanding the
non-governmental character of the particular employee’s functions or of the
relevant acts of the employer. <i>Sengupta</i> was decided at an early stage of
the development of the law in this area and, in my opinion, the test applied by
the Employment Appeal Tribunal was far too wide. I agree with the criticism of
the decision in Fox, <i>The Law of State Immunity</i>, 3rd ed (2013), 199n,
that the reasoning had more regard to the purpose than to the juridical
character of the claimant’s employment. It is not for this court to review the
domestic case-law of the other jurisdictions cited, least of all when they are
based on the categorisation of the particular facts. For my part, however, I
doubt whether an English court applying customary international law could
properly have categorised the facts of these cases as involving exercises of
sovereign authority. The way in which the restrictive doctrine has been applied
by the European Court of Human Rights, the federal courts of the United States
and the French Cour de Cassation appears to me to be more consistent with the
underlying principle. What is, however, clear beyond argument is that there is
no international consensus on this point sufficient to found a rule of
customary international law corresponding to section 16(1)(a) of the State
Immunity Act 1978.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have already pointed out that in treating article 11 as expressing
customary international law, the European Court of Human Rights had in mind
those parts of article 11 which reflected the restrictive doctrine. In all of
the cases in which it has held the recognition of immunity to violate article 6
of the Human Rights Convention, the applicant appears to have been a national
or permanently resident in the forum state. The applicant did not therefore
enjoy diplomatic immunity and neither article 11(2)(b)(iv) nor article 11(2)(e)
arose for consideration.</a></p><a name="para74">

<p class="ParaHeading">Application to the present cases</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since I have concluded that no principle of international law deprived
the Employment Tribunal of jurisdiction in these cases, it follows that the
United Kingdom had jurisdiction over Libya and Sudan as a matter of
international law, and article 6 is engaged by its refusal to exercise it. The
jurisdictional issue raised by Lord Millett in <i>Holland v Lampen-Wolfe</i>
and by Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann in <i>Jones v Saudi Arabia</i> does not
arise.</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The employment of Ms Janah and Ms Benkharbouche were clearly not
exercises of sovereign authority, and nothing about their alleged treatment
engaged the sovereign interests of their employers. Nor are they seeking
reinstatement in a way that would restrict the right of their employers to
decide who is to be employed in their diplomatic missions. As a matter of
customary international law, therefore, their employers are not entitled to
immunity as regards these claims. It follows that so far as sections 4(2)(b) or
16(1)(a) of the State Immunity Act confer immunity, they are incompatible with
article 6 of the Human Rights Convention.</a></p><a name="para76">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discrimination</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms Janah’s case that the discriminatory character of section 4(2)(b) of
the Act is a violation of article 14 of the Human Rights Convention, read in
conjunction with article 6, adds nothing to her case based on article 6 alone.
Section 4(2)(b) unquestionably discriminates on grounds of nationality. The
only question is whether the discrimination is justifiable by reference to
international law. If state immunity is no answer to the claim under article 6
alone, then it is no answer to the claim under the combination of article 6 and
article 14. In my view, the denial of access to the courts to persons in her
position is unjustifiable whether it is discriminatory or not.</a></p><a name="para77">

<p class="ParaHeading">Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 47 provides, so far as relevant, that:</a></p><a name="para78">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“everyone whose rights and
freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an
effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down
in this article.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para78">The scope of article 47 of the Charter is not identical
to that of article 6 of the Human Rights Convention, but the Secretary of State
accepts that on the facts of this case if the Convention is violated, so is the
Charter. A claim to state immunity which is justified in international law,
would be an answer in both cases: <i>Mahamdia v People’s Democratic Republic of
Algeria</i> (Case C-154/11)<i> </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C15411.html">[2013] ICR 1</a>, Advocate General at paras
17-23, endorsed by the Court at para 55. It follows that there is no separate
issue as to article 47 of the Charter. The only difference that it makes is
that a conflict between EU law and English domestic law must be resolved in
favour of the former, and the latter must be disapplied; whereas the remedy in
the case of inconsistency with article 6 of the Human Rights Convention is a
declaration of incompatibility.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would dismiss the Secretary of State’s appeal and affirm the order of
the Court of Appeal. The result is that sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) of the
State Immunity Act 1978 will not apply to the claims derived from EU law for discrimination,
harassment and breach of the Working Time Regulations. Subject to any question
as to the application of section 4(2)(b) to the particular circumstances of Ms
Benkharbouche, the other claims (failure to provide payslips or a contract of
employment, unpaid wages, failure to pay the national minimum wage and unfair
dismissal) are barred by those sections of the Act. But to that extent they are
incompatible with article 6 of the Human Rights Convention, and also, in the
case of section 4(2)(b) with article 6 read with article 14 of the Convention.
Both cases must be remitted to the Employment Tribunal to determine the claims
based on EU law on their merits.</a></p><a name="para79">
