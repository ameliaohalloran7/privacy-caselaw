(“Mr Wright”) to the grant of planning permission by the local planning
authority (the second appellant: “the Council”) for the change of use of land
at Severndale Farm, Tidenham, Gloucestershire from agriculture to the erection
of a single community scale 500kW wind turbine for the generation of
electricity (“the development”). Mr Wright is a local resident. The first
appellant (“Resilient Severndale”) was the successful applicant for the

</span><span lang="EN-US">In its application for planning permission,
Resilient Severndale proposed that the wind turbine would be erected and run by
a community benefit society. The application included a promise that an annual
donation would be made to a local community fund, based on 4% of the society’s
turnover from the operation of the turbine over its projected life of 25 years
(“the community fund donation”). In deciding to grant planning permission for
the development the Council expressly took into account the community fund
donation. The Council imposed a condition (“condition 28”) that the development
be undertaken by a community benefit society with the community fund donation
as part of the scheme.</span></a></p><a name="para2">

</span><span lang="EN-US">Mr Wright challenged the grant of planning
permission on the grounds that the promised community fund donation was not a
material planning consideration and the Council had acted unlawfully by taking
it into account. Mr Wright succeeded in his challenge before Dove J at first
instance. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by Resilient Severndale and
the Council. They now appeal to this court.</span></a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Community initiatives are likely
to play an increasingly important role and should be encouraged as a way of
providing positive local benefit from renewable energy development. Further
information for communities interested in developing their own initiatives is
provided by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Local planning
authorities may wish to establish policies which give positive weight to
renewable and low carbon energy initiatives which have clear evidence of local
community involvement and leadership.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Neighbourhood plans are an
opportunity for communities to plan for community led renewable energy
developments. Neighbourhood Development Orders and Community Right to Build
Orders can be used to grant planning permission for renewable energy
development. To support community based initiatives a local planning authority
should set out clearly any strategic policies that those producing
neighbourhood plans or Orders will need to consider when developing proposals
that address renewable energy development. Local planning authorities should
also share relevant evidence that may assist those producing a neighbourhood
plan or Order, as part of their duty to advise or assist. As part of a
neighbourhood plan, communities can also look at developing a community energy
plan to underpin the neighbourhood plan.”</p>

</span>Under the heading “What are community benefits?”, the Introduction
continued as follows:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Community benefits can bring
tangible rewards to communities which host wind projects, over and above the
wider economic, energy security and environmental benefits that arise from
those developments. They are an important way of sharing the value that wind
energy can bring with the local community.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Community benefits include:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community benefit
funds - voluntary monetary payments from an onshore wind developer to the
community, usually provided via an annual cash sum, and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benefits in-kind -
other voluntary benefits which the developer provides to the community, such as
in-kind works, direct funding of projects, one-off funding, local energy
discount scheme or any other non-necessary site-specific benefits.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">In addition to the above, there
can also be:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community investment
(Shared ownership) - this is where a community has a financial stake, or
investment in a scheme. This can include co-operative schemes and online
investment platforms.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socio-economic
community benefits - job creation, skills training, apprenticeships,
opportunities for educational visits and raising awareness of climate change.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material benefits -
derived from actions taken directly related to the development such as improved
infrastructure.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">This document contains guidance on
community benefit funds and benefits in-kind (points 1 and 2). The provision of
these community benefits is an entirely voluntary undertaking by wind farm
developers. They are not compensation payments.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Material and socio-economic benefits
will be considered as part of any planning application for the development and
will be determined by local planning authorities. They are not covered by this
guidance …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para7"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Prior to October 2014, many onshore wind developers already provided
voluntary contributions in various forms over the lifetime of their projects.
The DECC Guidance stated:</a></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The wind industry through
RenewableUK has consolidated this voluntary approach by coming together to
produce a protocol which commits developers of onshore wind projects above 5MW
(megawatts) in England to provide a community benefit package to the value of
at least £5,000 per MW of installed capacity per year, index-linked for the
operational lifetime of the project.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Community benefits offer a rare
opportunity for the local community to access resources, including long-term,
reliable and flexible funding to directly enhance their local economy, society
and environment …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The best outcomes tend to be
achieved when benefits are tailored to the needs of the local community …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It referred to a number of case studies where community
benefit funds have been set up by wind farm developers, eg by RWE Innogy UK in
respect of the Farr Wind Farm in Scotland (£3.5m over the lifetime of the wind
farm).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the DECC Guidance makes clear the relationship between the
guidance it gives in the context of renewable energy policy, and the planning
regime. Under the heading “Preparation phase guidance: Background to community
benefits”, it states:</a></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This document contains guidance
on community benefit funds and benefits-in kind. The provision of these
community benefits are entirely voluntary undertakings by wind farm developers
and should be related to the needs of the local community.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">These community benefits are
separate from the planning process and are not relevant to the decision as to
whether the planning application for a wind farm should be approved or not - ie
they are not ‘material’ to the planning process. This means they should
generally not be taken into account by local planning authorities when deciding
the outcome of a planning application for a wind [farm] development.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Currently the only situation in
which financial arrangements are considered material to planning is under the
Localism Act as amended (2011), which allows a local planning authority to take
into account financial benefits where there is a direct connection between the
intended use of the funds and the development.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And Planning Practice Guidance [the
PPG] states that, ‘Local planning authorities may wish to establish policies
which give positive weight to renewable and low carbon energy initiatives which
have clear evidence of local community involvement and leadership’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Socio-economic and material
benefits from onshore wind developments are types of benefit that can be taken
into consideration when a planning application is determined by the local
planning authority and are not covered by this Guidance.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><span lang="EN-US">This explanation is in accordance with
the general object of the DECC Guidance, which is to set out ways in which the
support of local communities for wind energy development in their area might be
promoted, rather than to provide policy guidance regarding the operation of the
planning system. The distinction was emphasised again later in the document,
under the heading “Planning phase guidance: Planning and the role of local
authorities”:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">“Local
authorities can play an important role in supporting community benefit
negotiations by supporting the development of neighbourhood, community or
parish plans and having positive local plan policies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">Community
benefits should be considered separately from any actions or contributions
required to make a development acceptable in planning terms. …</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">The primary role
of the local planning authority in relation to community benefits is to support
the sustainable development of communities within their jurisdiction and to
ensure that community benefits negotiations do not unduly influence the
determination of the planning application.</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">There is a strict
principle in the English planning system that a planning proposal should be
determined based on planning issues, as defined in law. Planning legislation prevents
local planning authorities from specifically seeking developer contributions
where they are not considered necessary to make the development acceptable in

consideration that could be taken into account when considering the planning

(amongst other things) the creation of a village handyman service, the
maintenance of publicly accessible defibrillators in the village, the purchase
of waterproof clothing to enable young members of the community to participate

a material consideration for planning purposes. He submitted that it did not

connection to the proposed development. At first instance Dove J accepted those
submissions and made an order quashing the permission. He applied what he took
to be settled law regarding what constitutes a material consideration for the
purposes of the planning statutes derived from a series of authorities, in
particular <i>Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment

</span>The Council and Resilient Severndale appealed. Their appeal was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal in a judgment by Hickinbottom LJ, with which
McFarlane and Davis LJJ agreed. Hickinbottom LJ agreed with the reasons given
by Dove J. He relied on the same case law and also on <i>Elsick Development Co
Ltd v Aberdeen City and Shire Strategic Development Planning Authority</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/66.html">[2017] UKSC 66</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/66.html">[2017] PTSR 1413</a> (“<i>Aberdeen</i>”), a decision which post-dated Dove
J’s judgment but which, in the view of Hickinbottom LJ, confirmed that the
judge’s approach was correct. Davis LJ gave a short concurring judgment to
emphasise that the question was not whether the proffered benefits were
desirable, but whether in planning terms they were material and whether they
satisfied the criteria of materiality set out in the speech of Viscount
Dilhorne in <i>Newbury </i>at p 599H (“the <i>Newbury</i> criteria”). Davis LJ
also expressed agreement with the judgment of Dove J.</p>

</span>The Council and Resilient Severndale now appeal to this court. They
contend that Dove J and the Court of Appeal erred in their approach to the
question of what counts as a material consideration for the purpose of section
70(2) of the 1990 Act and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act and that they should
have found that the community benefits to be derived from the development
constitute a material consideration which the Committee was entitled to take
into account when it decided to grant planning permission for the development.
The main burden of presenting the oral argument for the appellants was assumed
by Mr Martin Kingston QC, for Resilient Severndale. The Secretary of State for
Housing, Communities and Local Government was given permission to intervene
orally and in writing. He was represented by Mr Richard Kimblin QC. Mr Kimblin
made submissions which were supportive of the arguments for the appellants. He
invited the court to “update <i>Newbury </i>to a modern and expanded
understanding of planning purposes”.</a></p><a name="para30">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Planning permission is required “for the carrying out of any development
of land”: section 57(1) of the 1990 Act. So far as is relevant, “development”
is defined in section 55(1) to mean “the making of any material change in the
use of any buildings or other land”. Section 70(2) of the 1990 Act requires a
planning authority to have regard to the development plan and certain other
matters “so far as material to the application” and to “any other material
considerations”: that is to say, material to the change of use which is
proposed. Similarly, in relation to an application for planning permission, the
“material considerations” referred to in section 38(6) of the 2004 Act are
considerations material to the change of use which is proposed.</a></p><a name="para31">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Newbury </i>at pp 599-601 Viscount Dilhorne treated the scope of
the concept of “material considerations” in section 29(1) of the Town and
Country Planning Act 1971 (which corresponds to what is now section 70(2) of
the 1990 Act) as the same as the ambit of the power of a local planning
authority (in what is now section 70(1)(a) of the 1990 Act) to impose such
conditions “as they think fit” on the grant of planning permission. It had been
established in <i>Pyx Granite Co Ltd v Ministry of Housing and Local Government
</i>[1958] 1 QB 554 (“<i>Pyx</i> <i>Granite</i>”), <i>Fawcett Properties Ltd v
Buckingham County Council </i>[1961] AC 636 (“<i>Fawcett</i> <i>Properties</i>”)
and<i> Mixnam’s Properties Ltd v Chertsey Urban District Council </i>[1965] AC
735 (“<i>Mixnam’s</i> <i>Properties</i>”) that the power to impose conditions
was not unlimited. Viscount Dilhorne referred to the following statement by
Lord Denning in <i>Pyx Granite </i>at p 572, approved in <i>Fawcett Properties </i>and
<i>Mixnam’s Properties</i>:</a></p><a name="para32">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the law says that those
conditions, to be valid, must fairly and reasonably relate to the permitted
development. The planning authority are not at liberty to use their powers for
an ulterior object, however desirable that object may seem to them to be in the
public interest.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Viscount Dilhorne referred to other authority as well and
set out the <i>Newbury </i>criteria at p 599H as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the conditions imposed must be for
a planning purpose and not for any ulterior one, and … they must fairly and
reasonably relate to the development permitted. Also they must not be so
unreasonable that no reasonable planning authority could have imposed them …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Edmund-Davies agreed with the speech of Viscount Dilhorne. Lord
Fraser of Tullybelton approved the same three-fold test in his speech at pp
607-608, as did Lord Scarman at pp 618-619 and Lord Lane at p 627. The view of
the law lords was that a condition attached to the grant of planning permission
for the change of use of two hangars to use as warehouses on condition that
they were removed at the end of a specified period of time did not fairly or
reasonably relate to the permitted development and was therefore void.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The equation of the ambit of “material considerations” with the ambit of
the power to impose planning conditions is logical, because if a local planning
authority has power to impose a particular planning condition as the basis for
its grant of permission it would follow that it could treat the imposition of
that condition as a material factor in favour of granting permission. The
relevance of the <i>Newbury </i>criteria to determine the ambit of “material considerations”
in what is now section 70(2) of the 1990 Act and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act
is well established and is not in contention on this appeal.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>The <i>Westminster</i> case was concerned with the lawfulness of a
policy adopted by the City of Westminster as part of its local plan to promote
and preserve certain long established industries in central London and to limit
the grant of planning permission for office development to exceptional cases.
The House of Lords applied the same test for whether a matter was a material
consideration in the preparation of a local plan as in relation to the grant or
refusal of planning permission (under provisions of the Town and Country
Planning Act 1971 which have been re-enacted in the 1990 Act), and held that
the policy was concerned with a genuine planning purpose, namely the continuation
of industrial use important to the character and functioning of the city, and
hence was lawful.</a></p><a name="para35">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Scarman gave the sole substantive speech, with which the other
members of the appellate committee agreed. He referred at p 669 to the
statement by Lord Parker CJ in <i>East Barnet Urban District Council v British
Transport Commission</i> [1962] 2 QB 484, at p 491, that when considering
whether there has been a change of use of land “what is really to be considered
is the character of the use of the land, not the particular purpose of a
particular occupier.” Lord Scarman pointed out (p 670) that development plans
are concerned with “development”, “a term of art in the planning legislation
which includes now, and has always included, the making of a material change in
the use of land.” He held that Lord Parker’s dictum applies to the grant or
refusal of planning permission, to the imposition of conditions and also to the
formulation of planning policies and proposals, and said (p 670):</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The test, therefore, of what is a
material ‘consideration’ in the preparation of plans or in the control of
development … is whether it serves a planning purpose: see [<i>Newbury</i>],
599 per Viscount Dilhorne. And a planning purpose is one which relates to the
character of the use of land.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has long been recognised that a consequence of this approach of
relying on the <i>Newbury </i>criteria to identify “material considerations” is
that planning permission cannot be bought or sold. In <i>City of Bradford
Metropolitan Councils v Secretary of State for the Environment </i>(1986) 53 P
&amp; CR 55, at 64, Lloyd LJ said that this was “axiomatic”. In <i>Plymouth </i>this
was taken to be a correct statement of the law (at p 83, per Russell LJ; p 84,
per Evans LJ; and p 90, per Hoffmann LJ). <i>Plymouth </i>was concerned with
whether a developer’s agreement to provide certain off-site benefits could
properly be regarded as fairly and reasonably related to the development for
which permission was sought, so as to constitute a material consideration which
the local planning authority was entitled to take into account when granting
permission. The <i>Newbury </i>criteria were applied in order to answer that
question. On the facts, a sufficient connection with the proposed development
was found to exist. That was also the case in relation to certain off-site
benefits taken into account in <i>Tesco</i>: see pp 782-783 per Lord Hoffmann,
as he had become. In both cases, there was a sufficiently close nexus between
the off-site benefits to be provided and the proposed change in the character
of the use of the land involved in the proposed development.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, in <i>Plymouth </i>Hoffmann LJ made reference at p 90 to a
general principle that planning control should restrict the rights of
landowners only so far as may be necessary to prevent harm to community
interests and referred to the concept of materiality in that regard, “because
there is a public interest in not allowing planning permissions to be sold in
exchange for benefits which are not planning considerations or do not relate to
the proposed development”. This statement was not qualified in <i>Tesco</i>.
Therefore, a condition or undertaking that a landowner pay money to a fund to
provide for general community benefits unrelated to the proposed change in the
character of the use of the development land does not have a sufficient
connection with the proposed development as to qualify as a “material
consideration” in relation to it.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A principled approach to identifying material considerations in line
with the <i>Newbury </i>criteria is important both as a protection for
landowners and as a protection for the public interest. It prevents a planning
authority from extracting money or other benefits from a landowner as a
condition for granting permission to develop its land, when such payment or the
provision of such benefits has no sufficient connection with the proposed use
of the land. It also prevents a developer from offering to make payments or
provide benefits which have no sufficient connection with the proposed use of
the land, as a way of buying a planning permission which it would be contrary
to the public interest to grant according to the merits of the development
itself.</a></p><a name="para39">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court in <i>Aberdeen </i>these points were emphasised by Lord
Hodge (with whom the other members of the court agreed) at paras 43-46. In that
case, planning obligations imposed on developers to make contributions to
assist with development of infrastructure around Aberdeen were found to be
unlawful because they were not related to the use of the land for which the
developers sought planning permission. At para 43, Lord Hodge cited with
approval a passage from the judgment of Beldam LJ in <i>Tesco Stores Ltd v
Secretary of State for the Environment </i>(1994) 68 P &amp; CR 219, at
234-235, including the following:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Against the background that it is
a fundamental principle that planning permission cannot be bought or sold, it
does not seem unreasonable to interpret [subsection 106(1)(d) of the 1990 Act]
so that a planning obligation requiring a sum or sums to be paid to the
planning authority should be for a planning purpose or objective which should
be in some way connected with or relate to the land in which the person
entering into the obligation is interested.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 44 Lord Hodge continued:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A planning obligation, which
required as a pre-condition for commencing development that a developer pay a
financial contribution for a purpose which did not relate to the burdened land,
could be said to restrict the development of the site, but it would also be
unlawful. Were such a restriction lawful, a planning authority could use a
planning obligation in the context of an application for planning permission to
extract from a developer benefits for the community which were wholly
unconnected with the proposed development, thereby undermining the obligation
on the planning authority to determine the application on its merits.
Similarly, a developer could seek to obtain a planning permission by
unilaterally undertaking a planning obligation not to develop its site until it
had funded extraneous infrastructure or other community facilities unconnected
with its development. This could amount to the buying and selling of a planning
permission. Section 75, when interpreted in its statutory context, contains an
implicit limitation on the purposes of a negative suspensive planning
obligation, namely that the restriction must serve a purpose in relation to the
development or use of the burdened site. An ulterior purpose, even if it could
be categorised as a planning purpose in a broad sense, will not suffice. It is
that implicit restriction which makes it both ultra vires and also unreasonable
in the <i>Wednesbury</i> sense for a planning authority to use planning
obligations for such an ulterior purpose.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The protection for landowners on the one hand and for the public
interest on the other has been held to be established by Parliament through
statute, as interpreted by the courts. Parliament has itself in this way
underwritten the integrity of the planning system. In <i>Tesco </i>Lord
Hoffmann pointed out that the question of whether something is a material
consideration is a question of law: p 780. Statute cannot be overridden or
diluted by general policies laid down by central government (whether in the
form of the NPPF or otherwise), nor by policies adopted by local planning
authorities. As Lord Hodge said in <i>Aberdeen </i>at para 51, “The inclusion
of a policy in the development plan, that the planning authority will seek … a
planning obligation from developers [to contribute money for purposes

</span>The same point can be made about the policy statements in the DECC
Guidance. In any event, as set out above, that document itself explains that
the guidance it contains has to be read subject to the established legal
position regarding what qualifies as a material consideration for the purposes
of the grant of planning permission.</a></p><a name="para43">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the community benefits promised by Resilient
Severndale did not satisfy the <i>Newbury </i>criteria and hence did not
qualify as a material consideration within the meaning of that term in section
70(2) of the 1990 Act and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act. Dove J and the Court
of Appeal were right so to hold. The benefits were not proposed as a means of
pursuing any proper planning purpose, but for the ulterior purpose of providing
general benefits to the community. Moreover, they did not fairly and reasonably
relate to the development for which permission was sought. Resilient Severndale
required planning permission for the carrying out of “development” of the land
in question, as that term is defined in section 55(1) of the 1990 Act. The community
benefits to be provided by Resilient Severndale did not affect the use of the
land. Instead, they were proffered as a general inducement to the Council to
grant planning permission and constituted a method of seeking to buy the
permission sought, in breach of the principle that planning permission cannot
be bought or sold. This is so whether the development scheme is regarded as
commercial and profit-making in nature, as Hickinbottom LJ thought it was (para
39), or as a purely community-run scheme to create community benefits.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the appellants, Mr Kingston submitted that the planning statutes had
to be regarded as “always speaking” so far as concerns what counts as a
“material consideration”, and that this meant that the meaning of this concept
should be updated in line with changing government policy. I do not agree. The
meaning of the term “material consideration” in section 70(2) of the 1990 Act
and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act is not in doubt and updating the established
meaning of the term is neither required nor appropriate. To say that the
meaning of the term changes according to what is said by Ministers in policy
statements would undermine the position, as explained above, that what
qualifies as a “material consideration” is a question of law on which the
courts have already provided authoritative rulings. The interpretation given to
that statutory term by the courts provides a clear meaning which is principled
and stable over time. I note that Parliament has considered it necessary to
amend section 70(2) when it wishes to expand the range of factors which may be
treated as material for the purposes of that provision, for instance in
relation to the Welsh language: subparagraph (aa).</a></p><a name="para45">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Kingston relied on statements in <i>Fawcett Properties </i>which he
maintained showed that policies do inform the meaning of the statutory term
“material consideration”, and suggested that since this authority was referred
to and relied upon by the House of Lords in <i>Newbury</i> the interpretation
of “material consideration” taken from the latter case had to be read as
subject to what was said about this in <i>Fawcett Properties</i>. However, in
my view, nothing said in <i>Fawcett Properties</i> supports Mr Kingston’s
submission.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that case, a local planning authority had granted permission for the
building of two cottages on green belt land subject to a condition that their
occupation was limited to persons whose employment is or was in agriculture,
forestry or an industry related to agriculture, and their dependants. At the
time of imposing the condition the local planning authority had issued a draft
outline development plan which indicated that its object in relation to the
area where the cottages were to be built was to maintain the normal life of an
agricultural district. When imposing the condition the authority stated that
the reason for doing so was that it “would not be prepared to permit the
erection of dwelling-houses on this site unconnected with the use of the
adjoining land for agriculture or similar purposes”. The appellants later
acquired the freehold and brought proceedings to challenge the validity of the
condition on various grounds, including that (i) the imposition of a condition
according to the personality of the occupier rather than with reference to the
user of the premises was outside the power of the local planning authority to
impose such conditions as it thought fit and (ii) the condition bore no
reasonable relation to the policy in the outline plan or to any other sensible
planning policy. Lord Jenkins described the first challenge as the “broad”
ultra vires claim and the second as the “narrow” ultra vires claim: pp 683-684.
The nature of these challenges was explained clearly by Romer LJ in the Court
of Appeal ([1959] Ch 543 at 572-573 and 568-572, respectively), in a judgment
approved by the House of Lords on these points. The House of Lords dismissed
the challenge and upheld the condition.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is ground (i) which is relevant for present purposes. On that, Romer
LJ held that a condition framed with reference to the occupation of the
inhabitants of the cottages was sufficiently linked to the user of the land in
question as to be permissible: [1959] Ch 543, 572-573; and to similar effect
see 558-559 per Lord Evershed MR and 578-579 per Pearce LJ. This reasoning was upheld
in the House of Lords: p 659 (Lord Cohen), p 667 (Lord Morton of Henryton), p
675 (Lord Keith of Avonholm), p 679 (Lord Denning) and pp 683-684 (Lord
Jenkins). The reasoning in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords on
this point is fully in line with Viscount Dilhorne’s statement of the first two
of the <i>Newbury </i>criteria. It offers no support for the submission that
the statutory concept of a “material consideration” varies according to the
content of planning policy documents.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Kingston, however, in seeking to advance that submission, sought to
rely on passages in the speeches in the House of Lords which were directed not
to ground (i) and the question whether the condition related to the development
permitted, in the sense of being sufficiently connected with the proposed
change in use of the land, but rather to ground (ii): pp 660-661 (Lord Cohen),
674-675 (Lord Keith), 679 (Lord Denning) and 684-685 (Lord Jenkins). Ground
(ii) was concerned with a different question, arising under the third of what
were later called the <i>Newbury </i>criteria, namely whether the condition was
rationally connected, not with the proposed change in use of the land, but with
the policy in the outline plan or “any other sensible planning policy” (pp
660-661 per Lord Cohen). The Court of Appeal dismissed this challenge, on the
basis that there was a sufficient rational connection between the condition and
the policy in the outline plan. All members of the appellate committee of the
House of Lords came to the same conclusion. Contrary to the submission of Mr
Kingston, their reasoning in that regard does not indicate that the statutory
concept of a “material consideration” varies according to the content of
planning policy documents.</a></p><a name="para49">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Kingston also sought to gain support for his argument from a series
of cases in which policy was relied upon in order to justify the imposition of
conditions or, he submitted, to identify material considerations for the
purposes of the planning statutes. Again, however, on proper analysis these
authorities do not help him.</a></p><a name="para50">

</span>In <i>R (Copeland) v London Borough of Tower Hamlets</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2010/1845.html">[2010] EWHC 1845 (Admin)</a> a local planning authority had to consider whether to grant
planning permission for a fast-food outlet near a school, which was said to
conflict with government policy on healthy eating for children. The authority
proceeded on the footing that this was not capable of being a material
consideration. However, at the hearing the authority’s counsel accepted that
whether the site was used for a fast-food outlet was a matter which “relates to
the use of land and is thus capable of being a planning consideration” (para
25) and the decision was quashed, because the planning committee had not
appreciated, as they should have done, that this was a matter capable of being
a material consideration to which they could give consideration. The concession
made by counsel was clearly correct: whether or not the property was used as a
fast-food outlet was very directly a matter concerning its use. The policy did
not affect that one way or the other. It was relevant to a different question,
whether in policy terms the grant of planning permission would be justified or
not.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same analysis applies in relation to the other authorities on which
Mr Kingston relied. In each case, a condition was imposed or planning
permission was refused on the basis of a consideration which directly related
to the use of the land in question and hence which satisfied the second of the <i>Newbury
</i>criteria. The policy justification for the condition or for treating the
consideration as having significant weight was a distinct matter, as in <i>Fawcett
Properties</i>, and it was in relation to this that reference to policy
guidance was significant. Contrary to the submission of Mr Kingston, the policy
guidance did not affect the meaning of the term “material consideration” in the
planning statutes.</a></p><a name="para52">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>R v Hillingdon London Borough Council, Ex p Royco Homes Ltd </i>[1974]
QB 720 the Court of Appeal held in relation to the grant of planning permission
for a residential development that the imposition of conditions that the houses
built should be occupied by persons on the planning authority’s housing waiting
list was ultra vires, on the basis that the conditions were a fundamental
departure from the rights of ownership and were so unreasonable that no local
planning authority, appreciating its duty and properly applying itself to the
facts, could have imposed them: the imposition was found to be <i>Wednesbury </i>unreasonable
(see pp 731-732 per Lord Widgery CJ, referring to<i> Associated Provincial
Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corpn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html">[1948] 1 KB 223</a>). The result was that
the planning permission was quashed. Mr Kingston rightly points out that later
national planning policy guidance contemplated that use of land for the provision
of affordable housing would be a desirable policy objective and that conditions
in relation to residential developments requiring a proportion of dwellings to
be made available for affordable housing are now accepted as lawful and are
very common. However, this is because the alteration in national policy has
made it clear that a reasonable local planning authority, acting within the
parameters of the <i>Wednesbury </i>decision, can properly find such a
condition to be justified in terms of planning policy. Contrary to Mr
Kingston’s submission, the change in the legal position has not occurred
because the meaning of the statutory term “material consideration” has been
altered by reason of the promulgation of new national planning policy. Mr
Kingston’s submission again confuses two different questions.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This point is borne out by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Mitchell
v Secretary of State for the Environment </i>(1995) 69 P &amp; CR 60, on which
Mr Kingston also relied. In that case, a developer applied for planning
permission to convert a building from use for multiple occupation by way of
bedsitting rooms to a small number of self-contained flats. There was a draft
development plan of the local planning authority which set out a policy to
resist such changes of use, on grounds of the local need for affordable housing
in the authority’s area. The authority refused permission for the development,
relying on the policy in the draft plan as a material consideration. The
developer appealed to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State dismissed
the appeal and refused planning permission, treating the need for affordable
housing as a material consideration as the authority had done. The developer
challenged the Secretary of State’s decision, contending that the policy of the
authority was not a material consideration, and was successful at first
instance in having the decision quashed. The Court of Appeal allowed the
Secretary of State’s appeal. Saville LJ (with whom the other members of the
court agreed) observed at p 62 that the proposed change from multiple
occupation to self-contained flats was a change in the character of the use of
the land within the guidance given by Lord Scarman in <i>Westminster </i>at p
670 (see above). He held that the need for affordable housing in a particular
area was a relevant policy consideration which justified the Secretary of State
in deciding to refuse to grant permission for the development in question.
Balcombe LJ gave a short concurring judgment, referring to planning policy guidance
regarding the desirability of provision of affordable housing. There was no
question in the case as to whether what was in issue sufficiently related to
the proposed use of the land itself: clearly, the configuration of the
accommodation in the property directly related to the use of the land. The
question was whether there was sufficient policy justification for insisting
that the use of the land should be consistent with the draft development plan
policy to promote affordable housing, and it was held that there was. Balcombe
LJ regarded it as material to that question that national planning policy
guidance had been issued stating that this should be treated as a material
planning consideration.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>R (Welcome Break Group Ltd) v Stroud District Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/140.html">[2012] EWHC 140 (Admin)</a> concerned the grant of planning permission to develop land as a
motorway service area upon condition of the acceptance of obligations by the
developer and site owner in an agreement made under section 106 of the 1990 Act
which included that a local employment and training policy should be submitted
for the approval of the local planning authority and that reasonable endeavours
would be used to stock goods and produce from local producers for sale at the
site. A challenge to quash the grant of planning permission, including on the
ground that the condition and obligations were immaterial to the merits of the
proposed development, was dismissed. The judge implicitly found at paras 50 and
53 that there was a sufficient connection between the obligations and the
proposed development (that is to say, the proposed use of the land) so that
these were matters capable of falling within the statutory concept of “material
considerations”, and separately held that there was sufficient policy justification
for the authority to be entitled to impose the condition as a matter of
planning judgment (paras 49-53). It was in relation to this latter issue that
he took into account national planning policy guidance and the relevant
regional policy dealing with support for the sustainable development of the
regional economy. So, again, this authority provides no support for Mr
Kingston’s submission.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same points apply as regards <i>Verdin (t/a The Darnhall Estate) v
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/2079.html">[2017] EWHC 2079 (Admin)</a>. The case concerned a challenge to a decision of the Secretary of State
refusing planning permission for residential development. The claimant was
successful on a number of grounds, including that the Secretary of State had
wrongly rejected, without giving adequate reasons, a proposed condition
requiring local firms to be used for the development and a proposed condition
requiring local procurement as part of the proposed development. However, there
was no issue regarding whether these conditions sufficiently related to the
proposed use of the land. It seems to have been common ground that they did.
Rather, the grounds of challenge were analysed in relation to the distinct
question whether there was a sufficient policy basis on which these conditions
could be said to be material considerations. It was in relation to that
question that the judge had regard to national policy in the NPPF and the
development plan regarding sustainable economic development: see paras 92-98
and 108-114, respectively. The two conditions were potentially material in
terms of policy, and the Secretary of State had not given adequate reasons to
explain why he had rejected them.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, Mr Kingston relied on <i>R (Working Title Films Ltd) v
Westminster City Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1855.html">[2016] EWHC 1855 (Admin)</a>. This concerned a
challenge to the grant of planning permission for erection of a building for
mixed uses, including the provision within it of a community hall in accordance
with a planning obligation undertaken by the developer. A ground of challenge
relied on was that the local planning authority was wrong to have had regard to
the community benefit from provision of the community hall as something which
compensated for under-provision of affordable housing in the residential part
of the development. The judge rejected the challenge, holding that this was a
planning judgment which the authority was entitled to make: para 25. Again, the
case provides no support for Mr Kingston’s submission. The planning obligation
clearly related to the use of the land, and this was not in issue. The
discussion related to the policy justification for accepting such a planning
obligation.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons given above, I would dismiss this appeal. I would resist
Mr Kimblin’s invitation on behalf of the Secretary of State that we should
“update <i>Newbury</i>”. In deciding to grant planning permission for the
development, the Council relied on matters which do not qualify as “material
considerations” for the purposes of section 70(2) of the 1990 Act and section
38(6) of the 2004 Act. That means that the grant of planning permission has
rightly been quashed. It is unnecessary to give separate consideration to
condition 28. The imposition of that condition cannot make an immaterial
consideration into a material consideration within the meaning of the statutory
provisions.</a></p><a name="para58">
