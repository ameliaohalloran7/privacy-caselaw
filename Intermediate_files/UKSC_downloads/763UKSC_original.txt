<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is brought by the mother of an eight-year-old girl whom I anonymise as G. She was born in South Africa and has been habitually resident there throughout her life. On 2 March 2020 her mother wrongfully removed G from South Africa to England in breach of G’s father’s rights of custody under South African law. The father seeks an order returning G to South Africa under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction concluded on 25 October 1980 (“the 1980 Hague Convention”) as incorporated by the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”). In opposing a return order, the mother relies upon two grounds, namely articles 13(b) (grave risk to the child) and 13(2) (child’s own objections) of the 1980 Hague Convention. So far that is a description of a standard 1980 Hague Convention case.</a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in this case the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings have been complicated by the fact that, on arrival in England, the mother made an application to the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“the Secretary of State”) for asylum, naming G as a dependant. That application meant that there were two different sets of proceedings: the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings being determined in the Family Division of the High Court and the asylum application which, on 3 February 2021, and after the hearing in this court, was determined by the Secretary of State. So, this appeal raises important questions as to the interplay between the 1980 Hague Convention on the one hand and asylum law on the other, including the Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees adopted on 25 July 1951 (Cmd 9171) and 16 December 1966 (Cmd 3906) (“the 1951 Geneva Convention”) and relevant European Union Directives. That interplay brings into particular focus the relationship between the provisions protecting refugees from refoulement, that is expulsion or return to a country where they may be persecuted, and the requirement to return a child under the 1980 Hague Convention to the country from which the child or the child’s parent has sought refuge.</a></p><a name="para2"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a substantial risk that the time taken to determine an asylum application, which even if it is genuine can take months if not years, will frustrate the return of children under the 1980 Hague Convention because, by the time the asylum application concludes, the relationship between a child and the left-behind parent may be harmed beyond repair. In addition, there is a substantial risk of sham or tactical asylum claims being made by the taking parent with the intention of achieving that very objective.</a></p><a name="para3"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>In re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/27.html">[2011] UKSC 27</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/27.html">[2012] 1 AC 144</a> (“<i>In re E</i>”) Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Wilson of Culworth, when giving the judgment of the court, stated that “the aim of the [1980 Hague Convention] is as much to deter people from wrongfully abducting children as it is to serve the best interests of the children who have been abducted” (at para 14). It is obvious that the aim of deterring people from wrongfully abducting children will not be achieved if asylum claims can have the effect of frustrating or, worse still, can be exploited by the taking parent to frustrate the 1980 Hague Convention.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central questions are whether these two Conventions occupy different canvasses and, if not, how they can operate hand in hand in order to achieve the objectives of each of them without frustrating the objectives of either of them.</a></p><a name="para5"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court was informed that annually there are approximately one hundred 1980 Hague Convention applications in England and Wales though no information was provided as to the number in which there was a related application for asylum. This limited number indicates that even if the two Conventions are not independent of each other there should be no difficulty in implementing practical measures to ensure that they can operate hand in hand. Ultimately that will depend on proactive practical steps being taken to instil further urgency and priority into the asylum proceedings together with practical steps to co-ordinate both sets of proceedings. The parties and those intervening in these proceedings were committed to finding and implementing practical solutions. In particular, after the hearing in this court the Secretary of State has proposed an “Expedited process for determining asylum claims with concurrent Hague Convention proceedings” with “a view to deciding straightforward cases within 30 days from notification of proceedings from the Family Division”. Furthermore, in that document the Home Office “welcomes any support from the Family Division in resolving difficulties” by the exercise of the court’s case management powers. This is a valuable initiative by the Secretary of State, which, whilst focussing on the procedures in the parallel asylum claim, also addresses some elements as to how the two sets of proceedings can be co-ordinated.

If G had made her own separate application for asylum then the Court of Appeal considered that, whilst a return order could be made, it could not be implemented during the pendency of the application. It can be seen that whether a return order could be implemented depended on whether G had made a separate asylum application rather than being named as a dependant on her mother’s application. However, in practical terms, a bar to the implementation of a return order could be achieved by the simple expedient of the mother making an application on behalf of G, as she is entitled to do at any time during the currency of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings, up until the implementation of any return order.</p>

On this basis the mother submits that there is a bar to, at least, the implementation of a return order in circumstances where G was named as a dependant on her asylum application. The issue raised by this ground of appeal was formulated as follows:</a></p><a name="para11"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Can a child that is named as a dependant on a parent’s asylum application, but has not made a separate independent application for asylum, have protection from refoulement pending the determination of that application?”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The mother’s submissions in relation to this ground were confined to the question as to whether it could be “understood” that a child named as a dependant is making an application for asylum. That is the first question. However, the way in which the ground is framed also raises three further questions. The second is whether, if a child named as a dependant can be understood to be making an application for asylum, the child is protected from refoulement pending the determination of that application so that a return order cannot be implemented. The third is as to when an application for asylum is determined. The fourth arises if an application is still pending during any appeal period. That question is at what point in time does any remedy against a refusal of refugee status no longer have a suspensive effect on the implementation of a return order in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If a child named as a dependant is protected from refoulement pending the determination of the asylum application, does that protection from refoulement act as a bar (i) to the determination by the Family Division of the High Court of an application for a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention seeking the return of a child to the country of their habitual residence where that child has protection from refoulement, or (ii) to the making of a return order, or (iii) only to the implementation of the return order?”</p>

In 2006, he met the mother, a South African citizen who describes herself as coming from “a very traditional African family”. They married in 2010; and their only child, G, was born in South Africa in 2012. She has dual EUMS/South African nationality, but has always been habitually resident in South Africa.</a></p><a name="para15">

Relations between the parents remained difficult. The mother says that the father continued to be aggressive and abusive towards her. The mother was found to be HIV positive, the source of which was a matter of dispute between them. G continued to reside with her mother, but the father had regular contact. Following a divorce in 2018 and a report by a family counsellor, the South African equivalent of a child arrangements order was made. The father and the mother shared full parental rights and responsibilities in relation to G, who continued to live with the mother but had extensive contact with the father on alternate weekends and for half the school holidays, and he regularly picked up G from school. The father paid the mother maintenance and for items such as school fees.</a></p><a name="para17">

In December 2019, with the mother’s consent, the father took G to the EUMS of which they are nationals to spend time with his extended family. During that period, the mother visited the UK, from where she messaged the father to say that she had made contacts and found employment in England, and intended to remain in England. She sought the father’s agreement to the immediate relocation of G to England, suggesting that she could collect G from the EUMS, and take her directly from there to live in England. Alternatively, she also proposed the relocation of G to the EUMS were the father to agree to move there himself. The father objected to both proposals, pointing out that he had parental rights, he did not think that being schooled in England was in G’s best interests, and that the South African courts should make any decisions in relation to G.</a></p><a name="para18">

The father expected to see G when he picked her up from school on 2 March. However, when he got to the school that day, G was not there: in an exchange of texts, the mother said she was running late, and G would be at school the following day. However, she was not there at the end of that school day either. In fact, the mother had removed G from South Africa to England. A few days after the removal, on 8 March 2020, the mother sent further messages which the father points to as demonstrating the reasons behind the mother’s desire to relocate, including:</a></p><a name="para20"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I gave you a chance to leave [G] in [the EUMS], better future. But you refused. So I’m now making decisions for this child’s future without you.”</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I’m no longer your wife, you cannot force me to stay in a job that doesn’t pay me well.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The father also points to part of a message in which the mother stated that they were in California. However, in further messaging, the mother indicated that she had in fact taken G to England where she had enrolled her in a new school.

That request was transmitted to the English Central Authority, and an application was duly issued in the Family Division of the High Court on 14 April 2020. At the first hearing, before Newton J on 29 April 2020, various disclosure orders were made together with a location order. The mother was served, and the location order executed, the following day. A return date was fixed for 15 May 2020.</a></p><a name="para21">

However, it subsequently transpired from the Secretary of State’s skeleton argument in the Court of Appeal that, contrary to the indication in the letter of 12 May 2020, no application for asylum was ever made by G, but only by the mother, naming G as her dependant.</a></p><a name="para22">

However, following her separation from the father, she had told her sister (with whom she shared an apartment) that she was lesbian. The mother asserts that when she came out to her sister, her sister immediately left the apartment and then refused to talk to her. The mother also asserts that, as a result, she had been threatened by members of her family and, in May 2019, subjected to a very painful and frightening “cleansing ceremony” at her family’s home. She states:</a></p><a name="para23"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“On a Friday at the end of May 2019 I was unexpectedly invited to my family’s home. I was surprised as prior to that no one spoke to me although I believe that the threatening messages were coming from them. When I arrived, I was made to take off my clothes down to my underwear and sit on the floor. There was a healing woman (Sangoma) present who told me that they were going to cleanse me. This is called a cleansing ceremony. They had a sheep, they used a knife to cut the sheep’s throat, killing the sheep in front of me and then poured the blood over my head and rubbed it onto my exposed skin, covering my entire body. They took a collection of herbs (muti) and made them into a potion. The Sangoma then took a razor and made cuts first on my hands, then my ribs, my breasts, my pubic area, the bottom of my feet, my navel, my scalp and my privates (labia of my vagina), and then took the potion and rubbed it in forcefully with her fingers. It was very painful and I was very very scared as I did not know how far they would go. The injuries are still visible on my body. They said this would cleanse me and cure me of being a lesbian. They told me afterward that they are trying to help me to become a woman, remove the curse, correct my lesbianism, attract a new husband to get married again, they told me they wanted me to be normal. They said that this was a private family matter and the ritual was not to be spoken of at all afterward.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The mother does not state that she sought any medical treatment after this episode or that she reported it to the police. She recounts that, after the episode, she continued to receive threats from her family including death threats, that she reported to the police, but told them that she had not been injured, because she was so scared of what her family would do if she disclosed the torture. She stated that the police did not take the threats seriously and said they could do nothing about them. While she was in England in December 2019, her car in South Africa was vandalised; and, on her return to South Africa in February 2020, someone, whom she believed to have been her brother, tried to force her off the road whilst she was driving, writing off her car in the process. She made an insurance claim but there is no reference in her statement to a report to the police. She believed that this victimisation by her own family was as a consequence of her sexual orientation.</p>

The mother says that she did not tell the father because she did not think that he would help but would rather take G away from her. The mother’s statement dated 2 June 2020 describes the threat to her because of her sexual orientation but does not suggest that this caused any direct threat to G.</a></p><a name="para24">

In her application she named G as a dependant. It is asserted on behalf of the mother that in both her screening interview and in her witness statement in support of the asylum application, she stated her fear that G could be harmed by the acts of violence targeting the mother owing to her sexual orientation. It is also asserted on behalf of the mother that in a letter dated 7 December 2020, the mother’s immigration solicitors expressly requested that the Secretary of State consider the risk of harm to G in the mother’s asylum application. The mother has not disclosed in relation to the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings any of the documents in the asylum application, so that it has not been possible for this court to independently assess the accuracy of those assertions.</a></p><a name="para25">

No application to stay the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings had been made by either party. However, at the hearing, consideration was also given to a stay, as the Secretary of State had confirmed in the letter of 12 May 2020 that both the mother and G had each made an application for asylum which was outstanding. At para 10 of Lieven J’s judgment she recorded an acceptance by both the mother and father that the child could not be returned to South Africa until the asylum application was determined. Further, and again at para 10, even if the asylum application were rejected, the judge doubted whether G could be returned whilst any appeal was pending. On the basis of the likely time involved in the determination of the asylum application the judge considered that “it could be many months, indeed well more than a year, before there is any possibility of this child being returned to South Africa pursuant to the Hague Convention”.</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … Firstly, if the asylum application is allowed, then the legal position is that the child cannot be returned in any event. Secondly, in my view, the Secretary of State is in a better position to consider the factual issues than the court in exercising a Hague summary jurisdiction. Under that jurisdiction the court does not generally hear oral evidence, whereas the Secretary of State will undertake through her officers a detailed interview and that is undertaken by officers experienced in dealing with asylum issues and, further, the mother would then have, if there was a refusal, a right of appeal to a First-tier Tribunal [(‘FtT’)] where oral evidence is heard and subject to cross-examination. It is of course correct that the immigration and the [1980] Hague Convention processes and considerations are not the same, and the court will not be bound by any findings made in the immigration system. However, given that the child cannot be sent back to South Africa at the present time, and given there is a detailed investigation of the same factual nexus being undertaken by the [Secretary of State], it is sensible for her to complete at least the first stage of that process before the Family Division devotes its time to determining what might be an academic Hague application.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it is, in my view, quite inappropriate for this court to try and carry out some kind of preliminary consideration of the merits of the asylum application. … The appropriate course is to let the asylum application take its course and then once it has at least reached determination by the Secretary of State stage for the Family Division judge to consider what to do next.”</p>

However, she allowed the father’s application for disclosure of the documents in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings to the Secretary of State, on the basis that, in determining the asylum application, the Secretary of State might be assisted by those documents (see paras 16-19).</a></p><a name="para31">

At para 125 the Court of Appeal held that in relation to a child whose refugee status has been determined by the Secretary of State, article 21 of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (“the Qualification Directive”) was a bar to a return order. Article 21 of the Qualification Directive provides that “Member states shall respect the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with their international obligations” (the relevant international obligation being article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention). The Secretary of State submitted, and the Court of Appeal held, that the relevant provisions of the Qualification Directive were directly effective and remain extant in domestic law as “retained EU law” after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. The Court of Appeal held at para 127 that “children with refugee status cannot be returned under powers within the 1980 Hague Convention to the country from which they have been given refuge (or to a third country from which they risk being removed to such a country)”.</a></p><a name="para37">

The Court of Appeal having considered the terms of section 77 of the 2002 Act, which purports to transpose article 7, concluded at para 130 that “we do not consider that it is now possible to construe section 77 as fully transposing article 7”. The Court of Appeal stated that given the form of article 7, it did not give “any room for the exercise of powers of removal or return under any other provision, including the 1980 Hague Convention and 1985 Act”. Furthermore, as it was “a right arising from a Directive which has been recognised by our courts, the position will not be changed by the UK’s exit from the EU”.</a></p><a name="para40">

However, at paras 133-134 the Court of Appeal noted the submission on behalf of the Secretary of State that “a child [with a pending asylum appeal] cannot be returned under the 1980 Hague Convention because, by virtue of article 39(1)(a) of the Procedures Directive, a member state must provide an effective remedy against a negative decision on an application for asylum before a court or tribunal”. The Secretary of State submitted that “return under the 1980 Hague Convention of a child with a pending asylum appeal would … render the appeal ineffective”. The Court of Appeal noted at para 135 four difficulties with these submissions and at para 136 stated that “without having the benefit of full argument, it would not be appropriate to make any observations on whether there is any bar to the return of a child with a pending asylum appeal under the 1980 Hague Convention”.</a></p><a name="para42">

In arriving at that conclusion, the Court of Appeal referred at para 81 to article 7(1) of the Procedures Directive which requires member states to allow “applicants” to remain in the state during the pendency of the application. The Court of Appeal considered that “an “applicant” is restrictively defined in article 2(c) [of the Procedures Directive] to mean only a person who has made an application for asylum” and that there was nothing within the Procedures Directive “that prohibits the removal of a dependant of an asylum applicant who has no independent asylum claim of his or her own”. The Court of Appeal added that the “prohibition stems solely from paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules” which provides that:</a></p><a name="para43"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Until an asylum application has been determined by the Secretary of State … no action will be taken to require the departure of the asylum applicant or <i>their dependants</i> from the United Kingdom.” (Emphasis added)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">At para 140 the Court of Appeal, relying on <i>In re S 2002</i> concluded that:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules (which prohibits the removal of a dependant during the pendency of the principal applicant’s asylum claim) has nothing to do with the status and/or rights of a refugee. In particular, it is not an emanation of the duty not to refoule a refugee, but rather of the duty to have proper respect for family life. As such, on a proper interpretation, it cannot in our view act as a bar to the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention which is itself driven by welfare considerations and the principle of family unity.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">On this basis the Court of Appeal held that neither the Procedures Directive nor paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules prohibited removal under the 1980 Hague Convention “where the child is named as a dependant in an application for asylum by a parent, but makes no independent claim for international protection”.</p>

Rather, the question was posed in relation to circumstances where a child had been granted refugee status or where there was a pending independent asylum application by a child. In relation to both situations, the Court of Appeal concluded at para 152 that “any bar applies only to implementation” so that “even where a child cannot be returned under the 1980 Hague Convention because he or she has been granted or has applied for refugee status, the High Court is not prevented from <i>determining </i>an application for a return order, or indeed from making a return order; although, if a return order were to be made, it may be required to stay implementation.”</a></p><a name="para44">

The Court of Appeal then set out at para 161 the matters which it seemed were relevant matters to be included when determining whether, and, if so, when to grant a stay.

It was also their view that “[t]his applies equally to circumstances in which the taking parent and/or child have been granted refugee status; and, for these purposes, the grant of rights to the child by the Secretary of State because of the grant of refugee status to the parent”.</a></p><a name="para46">

All of them had intervened before the Court of Appeal except for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR”) and the International Academy of Family Lawyers (“the IAFL”). Their participation, along with that of counsel for the principal parties, greatly assisted the court. The following is a description of each of the interveners and a short summary of the position each of them adopted.</a></p><a name="para48">

The second written case took a fundamentally different approach to that adopted before the Court of Appeal and in the first written case. They also provided a note dated 23 January 2021 to explain the reasons for this change in position followed by a post-hearing note dated 10 February 2021. I make no criticism of the change in position but rather consider the willingness and ability to adopt a different position to reflect high professional standards. In the first case and in relation to ground one of the appeal the Secretary of State contended that it was unlawful for an order for the summary return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention to be implemented whilst a claim for international protection, in relation to which the child has been made a dependant, is pending before the Secretary of State. In relation to ground two it was submitted that the asylum determination process is separate from the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. As such, the existence of an outstanding claim for asylum does not prevent the Family Division from determining or otherwise progressing an application under the 1980 Hague Convention; save to the extent that any order requiring the return of a dependent child under the 1980 Hague Convention cannot be implemented whilst the claim for asylum in which the child is named as a dependant is pending before the Secretary of State. In relation to ground three it was submitted that it was a matter for the Family Division, on a case by case basis, to consider whether to stay proceedings and/or proceed with determining an application under the 1980 Hague Convention in the light of an asylum claim or of the grant of refugee status by the Secretary of State. However, the Secretary of State agreed with the Court of Appeal that the High Court should be slow to stay 1980 Hague Convention proceedings.</a></p><a name="para49">

The Secretary of State no longer sought to challenge the Court of Appeal’s finding that there is no bar to implementing a return order made under the 1980 Hague Convention in relation to a child who is named as a dependant to a claim for international protection that is pending before the Secretary of State. It was pointed out that it was open to the dependent child to make a claim for international protection in their own right and, if they did so, as the Court of Appeal recognised, they were thereafter protected from refoulement whilst their claim is being determined by the Secretary of State.</a></p><a name="para50"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second intervener, the International Centre for Family Law, Policy and Practice (“the ICFLPP”), is an organisation associated with the University of Westminster that is involved in family and child law with a particular focus on international aspects including child abduction. The ICFLPP acknowledged that the Secretary of State has the sole power to determine applications for asylum. However, it was submitted that an entitlement to protection from refoulement can be asserted and determined within the process of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. That was an issue which had not been raised by the father, so at the conclusion of the hearing the court invited written submissions from the parties and from all the interveners in relation to it and in particular to the following question:</a></p><a name="para51"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">In circumstances where an application for asylum has been made by or on behalf of a child and the Secretary of State has not yet made a decision on the application, is there any bar in law to a Family Court deciding in Hague Convention proceedings that the child is not a refugee and making and implementing an order for the return of the child to the country from which he or she has been removed in accordance with the Hague Convention?</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third intervener, Reunite International Child Abduction Centre (“Reunite”), undertakes and publishes research, and provides advice and assistance to individuals and government, statutory and voluntary bodies, in the field of international child abduction. Reunite adverted to the unfairness inherent in the administrative asylum process in which the left-behind parent had no right to participate. It was stated that the asylum process is “undertaken behind closed doors by officials exercising administrative functions” and that “the left behind parent has no right to see, let alone challenge, any evidence submitted as part of an asylum claim”. It was also submitted that the “process is one in which the welfare of the child plays only a peripheral role and where the child may not have a voice”. Reunite supported the proposition that the rights of refugee children must be fully respected so that no child who is in fact a refugee should be returned to a country where they face persecution.</a></p><a name="para52"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Reunite also submitted that the 1980 Hague Convention should not be rendered ineffective by an asylum process which was not designed for the resolution of disputes about a child arising from the breakdown of a parental relationship. The solution advanced on behalf of Reunite was that an order of the High Court was not a form of “refoulement” but rather the court was determining whether the child wished to remain in the United Kingdom. In this respect Reunite referred to the wording of article 7 of the Procedures Directive which provides that an asylum applicant must be “… <i>allowed to remain</i> in the member state in which the application is made … until the determining authority has made a decision in accordance with the procedures at first instance set out in Chapter III of the Directive” (emphasis added). It was stated that the use of permissive language in this context does not mean that an asylum applicant is prohibited from leaving if they choose to do so. It was also submitted that in the case of a child, that freedom of choice will be exercised by those who hold parental responsibility, so that if they cannot agree the court must make the decision as to whether or not they wish to remain in the United Kingdom. If the parents do not agree, the court can stand in their shoes and exercise a form of quasi-parental authority over the child, which is the function it exercises when making an order under the 1980 Hague Convention. Again, this was not an issue raised by the father.</a></p><a name="para53">

UNHCR also supported a harmonious application of the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1980 Hague Convention. In summary it was submitted:</a></p><a name="para55">

The requirement to implement this objective is based on the presumption that the prompt return of an abducted child promotes the interests of children generally as well as the interests of the individual child. So, what is meant by prompt? The answer is provided by article 11 which specifies that, if a decision is not reached within six weeks of the commencement of an application, then reasons for the delay can be requested. In short, the 1980 Hague Convention requires an application to be determined within six weeks.</a></p><a name="para68">

That obligation means that the courts will, for instance, take other cases out of the list to accommodate the earliest possible date for the determination of a 1980 Hague Convention application. However, the obligation extends not only to the courts but also to all those who are either directly or indirectly involved in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. This means that it extends to every step taken by all those involved in the investigation and determination of any related application for asylum. Any delay in either the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and in any related asylum application is inimical to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom to determine applications under the 1980 Hague Convention promptly, where necessary by giving priority to any step necessary to determine such an application.</a></p><a name="para69">

Recital (11) to the Procedures Directive states “It is in the interest of both member states and applicants for asylum to decide as soon as possible on applications for asylum”. Paragraph 333A of the Immigration Rules requires the Secretary of State to ensure that a decision is taken on an application for asylum “as soon as possible, without prejudice to an adequate and complete examination”.

The most significant, for the purposes of this appeal, is <i>In re S 2002</i> in which the Court of Appeal (Laws LJ, with whom Rix and Thorpe LJJ agreed) considered section 15 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 which was a predecessor of section 77 of the 2002 Act. Section 15 provided as follows:</a></p><a name="para112"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“During the period beginning when a person makes a claim for asylum and ending when the Secretary of State gives him notice of the decision on the claim, he may not be removed from, or required to leave, the United Kingdom.”</p>

Laws LJ continued by stating that “[t]he section is not intended to occupy any wider canvas. It cannot I think sensibly be read as creating a substantial exception or any exception to the obligations arising under article 12 of the Hague Convention or be intended to circumscribe the duty and discretion of a judge exercising the wardship jurisdiction.” In this way section 15 was held not to apply to 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. As the Court of Appeal in this case stated at para 129 “this construction appears subsequently to have been adopted or confirmed by the insertion into what is now section 77, after the reference to removal etc, of the words ‘in accordance with a provision of the Immigration Acts’ …”. An issue arises in this appeal as to whether section 77 of the 2002 Act does not apply to 1980 Hague Convention proceedings or whether by virtue of article 7 of the Procedures Directive applicants for asylum are protected from the implementation of a return order in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings until the determining authority, that is the Secretary of State, has made a decision.</a></p><a name="para113">

At para 27 he stated:</a></p><a name="para114"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Dependants are indeed protected by the law when a claim for asylum is made by mother or father.

As regards the position of such dependants pending an appeal by the principal asylum seeker, it is the practice of the Secretary of State not to remove them and that practice, absent some wholly exceptional justification for a departure from it, would no doubt be protected by the courts either under article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as scheduled to the Human Rights Act 1998, or as a matter of legitimate expectation or both.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">An issue arises in this case as to whether paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules provides protection for dependants as a consequence of their rights as refugees until a decision is taken by the Secretary of State, or whether Laws LJ had intimated that both paragraph 329 and this practice of the Secretary of State pending an appeal had “nothing to do with the status and/or rights of a refugee” but was rather an emanation of “the duty to have proper respect for family life”.</p>

The first is whether naming a child as a dependant on an asylum application can be understood to be an application by the child. If so, then the second question is whether the child is entitled to protection from refoulement pending the determination of that application so that a return order cannot be implemented. The third question is: when is an application for asylum determined? If an application is still pending during any appeal period, then the fourth question is at what point in time does any remedy against a refusal of refugee status no longer have a suspensive effect on the implementation of a return order in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. I will deal with each of those questions in turn.</a></p><a name="para115">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“138.&nbsp; Neither the 1951 Geneva Convention nor the Directives require any such protection, which can only arise from either (i) the parent’s application with the child as a named dependant being treated as a claim for asylum and subsidiary protection by the child himself or herself, or (ii) from considerations of family unity and the right to family life under article 8 of the ECHR.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have described (paras 86-89 above), whilst we understand that, on an application by a parent, the Secretary of State in fact considers whether a child requires international protection, <i>the application is not properly construed as - nor is it treated by the Secretary of State as - a form of deemed application for protection by the child</i>.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our view, as described above and as intimated by Laws LJ in <i>In re S (2002)</i> (see paras 80-82 and 100 above), <i>paragraph 329 of the Immigration Rules (which prohibits the removal of a dependant during the pendency of the principal applicant’s asylum claim) has nothing to do with the status and/or rights of a refugee. In particular, it is not an emanation of the duty not to refoule a refugee, but rather of the duty to have proper respect for family life.</i> As such, on a proper interpretation, it cannot in our view act as a bar to the return of a child under the 1980 Hague Convention which is itself driven by welfare considerations and the principle of family unity.” (Emphasis added)</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">I depart from the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in respect of those parts of these paragraphs to which I have added emphasis.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para116"></a><a name="para117">117.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that there is no obligation on the Secretary of State to consider whether an individual is a refugee absent any application. However, article 2(g) of the Qualification Directive (quoted at para 87 above) only requires there to be a request by a third country national or stateless person for protection <i>who can be understood</i> to seek refugee status (or other international protection). Also, article 2(b) of the Procedures Directive (quoted at para 91 above) only requires there to be an application made by a third country national or stateless person <i>which can be understood</i> as a request for international protection. I consider that a request for international protection made by a principal applicant naming a child as a dependant is also an application by the child, if objectively it can be understood as such. I also consider that, generally speaking, such an application can (and should) objectively be understood as an application by the child, for a combination of two reasons. The first is the inherent likelihood, expressly recognised in recital (27) to the Qualification Directive (quoted at para 85 above), that any grounds which an adult applicant may raise for fearing persecution or serious harm of a relevant kind will also apply, by reason of their relationship, to a child who is a dependant of that adult. The second is that, as pointed out in the Secretary of State’s submissions, in the case of a child, it is the parent applicant who determines, on behalf of their child, whether to make a claim for asylum. An omission by a child to make an application in their own right cannot therefore be regarded as a choice which the child has made (even if he or she has legal capacity to make it). Understanding an application for refugee status or other international protection which names a child as a dependant as including an application by the child accordingly protects the interests of the child by ensuring that the child’s own status is considered. Such separate consideration is necessary not least because, if the principal application is granted, the kind of residence permit for which the child is eligible depends on whether or not the child is a refugee or in need of international protection in his or her own right.</a></p><a name="para117">

If an application for international protection made by a parent naming a child as a dependant is not regarded as including an application by the child unless the latter application has been made formally, a refusal of the parent’s application would not prevent the parent from at that point making a further application for the child in his or her own right, which would then need to be considered and decided separately. In a case where there are 1980 Hague Convention proceedings pending this would have the potential to introduce an additional layer of delay. If there is a possibility that an asylum claim will be made in the name of the child, it is vital that it should be brought forward and decided at the first opportunity.</a></p><a name="para120">

That is not cutting across or directly interfering in the exercise by the Secretary of State of her exclusive powers with respect to the control of immigration and asylum.

I do not consider such an approach can be correct as it ignores the substantive effect of a return order which is that the child is being returned to the country from which they seek refuge. I consider that the obligation in article 7 binds the State in its entirety so as to preclude any emanation of the State (including the High Court) from implementing a return order so as to require an applicant to leave the United Kingdom whilst their asylum claim is being considered by the “determining authority”.</a></p><a name="para129">

I agree that if, on some exceptional basis, naming a child as a dependant cannot objectively be understood to be a request for refugee status for the child then paragraph 329 is an emanation of the duty to have proper respect for family life. However, where an application for international protection can objectively be understood as a request for international protection by a dependant, then I consider that paragraph 329 is an emanation of the duty not to refoule a refugee under article 7 of the Procedures Directive. So, in addition to relying on article 7 of the Procedures Directive a dependant who objectively can be understood to be making a request for international protection is entitled to rely on paragraph 329 which requires that no action will be taken to require his or her departure from the United Kingdom prior to the determination of the application by the Secretary of State.</a></p><a name="para131">

Article 7 of the Procedures Directive also refers to decisions at first instance, providing that “<i>Applicants</i> shall be allowed to remain in the member state, for the sole purpose of the procedure, <i>until the determining authority has made a decision</i> in accordance with the procedures <i>at first instance</i> set out in Chapter III” (emphasis added). So, the decision by the Secretary of State at first instance is not the final determination of the application. After the Secretary of State’s decision, a person still remains an applicant until a <i>final decision</i> has been taken. Article 2(c) of the Procedures Directive defines an applicant as meaning “a third country national or stateless person who has made an application for asylum in respect of which <i>a final decision</i> has not yet been taken” (emphasis added). Article 2(d) of the Procedures Directive provides that a “final decision” means “a decision on whether the third country national or stateless person be granted refugee status by virtue of [the Qualification Directive] and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the member states concerned pending its outcome, subject to Annex III to this Directive”.</a></p><a name="para135">

Article 39(1)(a) in that Chapter provides that “Member states shall ensure that applicants for asylum have the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal, against the following: “(a) a decision taken on their application for asylum …”. Article 39(2) provides that “Member states shall provide for time-limits and other necessary rules for the applicant to exercise his/her right to an effective remedy pursuant to paragraph 1”. Article 39(3) provides that “Member states shall, where appropriate, provide for rules in accordance with their international obligations dealing with: (a) the question of whether the remedy pursuant to paragraph 1 shall have the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the member state concerned pending its outcome”. It can be seen that member states have a margin of appreciation in relation to whether their domestic rules have the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the member state concerned pending the outcome of the effective remedy guaranteed by article 39(1). This is in contrast to article 7 which provides that prior to the first instance decision all applicants shall be allowed to remain in the member state.</a></p><a name="para136">

In Chapter III of the Procedures Directive a number of exceptions to the basic principles and guarantees are set out together with various provisions for curtailing or limiting the remedy provided to asylum seekers (see articles 27, 28 and 31).

At the other end of the spectrum there are various statutory provisions (reflecting the provisions of Chapter V of the Procedures Directive) restricting or otherwise precluding the exercise of appeal rights. For example the Secretary of State can issue a certificate: (i) under sections 94 and 94B of the 2002 Act where a claim is considered to be clearly unfounded (thereby requiring any appeal rights to be exercised from abroad) or (ii) under section 96 of the 2002 Act (which prevents a person from exercising an appeal right under section 82 if the Secretary of State considers that there is no satisfactory reason why a matter relied on in a further application for asylum was not raised during an appeal against a previous refusal).</a></p><a name="para143">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“While a person’s appeal under section 82(1) is pending he may not be -</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That protection only relates to being removed from or being required to leave the United Kingdom “in accordance with provisions of the Immigration Acts”. There is no requirement to read down section 78 to comply with article 7 of the Procedures Directive as the obligation in article 7 only applies until the Secretary of State has made a decision. A return order made under the 1980 Hague Convention does not remove or require a child to leave the United Kingdom in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Acts. So, the question arises as to whether the protection in section 78 applies to a child pending determination of their in-country appeal in order to comply with the obligation to provide an effective remedy under article 39 of the Procedures Directive.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Payne submitted that to implement a return order pending an in-country asylum appeal by a child would encroach on the Secretary of State’s exclusive responsibility, as the determining authority, to decide whether the merits of the asylum claim required the appellant to be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom whilst the appeal was determined in order for the appeal to be effective.</a></p><a name="para145">

In particular, (i) a child who has been returned to a country where they have nationality cannot meet the definition of “refugee” within article 1A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention or article 2(c) of the Qualification Directive, both of which require that they be outside their country of nationality; and (ii) a child who is not in the United Kingdom would not meet the criteria for the grant of refugee status and therefore the asylum claim could not be granted (see paragraphs 334 and 336 of the Immigration Rules). Furthermore, if the appeal were allowed, there would be no means to require the left-behind parent to obtain, or otherwise enforce, the return of the child to the United Kingdom. So, Mr Payne submitted, there cannot be an effective remedy under a pending in-country appeal if in the meantime the child has in fact been returned under the 1980 Hague Convention to the country from which they have sought refuge.</a></p><a name="para146"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146"></a><a name="para147">147.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal considered, at para 135, that there were four points which illustrated potential difficulties with Mr Payne’s analysis.</a></p><a name="para147"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147"></a><a name="para148">148.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first point was that:</a></p><a name="para148"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“article 7 of the Procedures Directive expressly distinguishes asylum applicants who are awaiting a determination from the ‘determining authority’ (here, the Secretary of State) from those who have had their applications determined even if they have appealed. The article 7 requirement to allow applicants to remain in the territory of the member state is restricted to the former. Consequently, … that leaves section 78 of the 2002 Act (with its restriction on removals to those ‘in accordance with the Immigration Acts’) more exposed.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">However, article 21 of the Qualification Directive requires member states to respect their international obligations regarding non-refoulement. This protection extends to refugees who are only recognised as such after a decision on appeal, because of the declaratory nature of a grant of refugee status. So, the implementation of a return order in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings in respect of a child with a pending in-country asylum appeal would not respect the United Kingdom’s international obligations in compliance with article 21 of the Qualification Directive if the child was in fact a refugee. To give proper effect to article 21 of the Qualification Directive the protection in section 78 of the 2002 Act cannot be limited to removal “in accordance with the Immigration Acts”. Rather, by virtue of article 21 it also prevents implementation of a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention of a child pending determination of an in-country appeal.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para148"></a><a name="para149">149.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second point was that:</a></p><a name="para149"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Despite the terms of article 1A of the 1951 Geneva Convention and paragraphs 334 and 336 of the Immigration Rules, sections 92 and 94 of the 2002 Act … clearly envisage asylum appeals being made out-of-country.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">However, the provisions for some asylum appeals to be made out-of-country do not assist in determining whether an in-country right of appeal would be ineffective if a return order was implemented in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. In circumstances where an out-of-country appeal is appropriate then an effective remedy is consistent with the child being returned to the country in question.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para149"></a><a name="para150">150.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third point was that:</a></p><a name="para150"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para150">“Not all decisions relating to an asylum application are appealable. Appeal rights do not fully satisfy or exhaust the requirements for an effective remedy, because the availability of judicial review to challenge material non-appealable decisions (eg decisions that representations do not amount to a fresh claim for the purposes of paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules, or certification under section 94 or 96 of the 2002 Act: again, see para 75 above) is an essential element in satisfying the UK’s obligation to provide an effective remedy under article 39 of the Procedures Directive (see, eg, <i>TN (Afghanistan) and MN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1609.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1609</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1609.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2095</a> at para 16 per Maurice Kay LJ with whom Beatson and Briggs LJJ (as he then was) agreed).”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">However, where there is no right of appeal, there is no aspect of the asylum process which prevents a return order being implemented after a decision by the Secretary of State has been taken. If there is a judicial review application, then it would be in the discretion of the judge hearing the application whether to grant interim relief by way of an order suspending removal. This provides no answer to Mr Payne’s submission that where the Secretary of State has decided that, in order for the remedy to be effective, an applicant must be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom, they should not be required to leave by implementation of a return order in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para151">151.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fourth point was that:</a></p><a name="para151"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An asylum appeal having an automatic and full suspensive effect is not necessarily required to satisfy the obligation to provide an effective remedy: even if the statutory immigration and asylum scheme does not itself directly and automatically bar removal under a return order, it is arguable that the requirements for an effective remedy are fulfilled by the ability to make an interim application in the relevant appeal or judicial review proceedings for an order prohibiting removal pending the outcome of the challenge.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">However, the issue is not whether all asylum appeals have an automatic or suspensive effect. Out-of-country asylum appeals do not have a suspensive effect. Rather, the question is whether a statutory in-country appeal has suspensive effect which in turn depends on whether the suspensive effect is required to provide an effective remedy. Furthermore, applicants are entitled to exercise their statutory right of appeal so that it is not appropriate to require the Secretary of State or an applicant to make an application for an interim order pending the outcome of their appeal.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para151"></a><a name="para152">152.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am of the view, for the reasons given by Mr Payne (see paras 145 and 146 above) that there cannot be an effective remedy under an in-country appeal process if in the meantime a child has in fact been returned under the 1980 Hague Convention to the country from which they have sought refuge. Accordingly, an in-country appeal acts as a bar to the implementation of a return order in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. Due to the time taken by the in-country appeal process this bar is likely to have a devastating impact on 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. I would suggest that this impact should urgently be addressed by consideration being given as to a legislative solution.</a></p><a name="para152">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the circumstances in which the grant of asylum or a pending asylum application is a bar, does it act as a bar to (i) the determination of the application, or (ii) the making of a return order, or (iii) the implementation of the return order?”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">At para 142 the Court of Appeal held:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We consider this issue to be more straightforward. In argument, Mr Payne accepted that the High Court could determine an application for and even order the return of a child who has been granted refugee status, even though he submitted that that order cannot be implemented whilst that status is maintained; and a fortiori where an application for asylum remains outstanding. In our view, he was right to accept that the only bar is to actual return - although the precise course the court should follow in a particular case (including the stage of the proceedings when any stay should be imposed) is a different question which we consider below (paras 157-158). The duty of non-refoulement and the article 7 duty to allow asylum applicants to remain involve a prohibition on returning a person to his or her country of nationality: they do not prohibit either (i) the return of a child to the country of his or her habitual residence which is not the country of nationality; and (ii) the taking of decisions which are preliminary or ancillary to actual return. Nothing in the domestic provisions impose any such prohibitions. Indeed, sections 77 and 78 of the 2002 Act make the line in (ii) clear, by prohibiting any act of removal of an asylum applicant whilst expressly allowing ‘interim or preparatory action’ up to and including the giving of removal directions (see paras 77, 78 and 79(iii) above).”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para154"></a><a name="para155">155.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ground of appeal was in essence based on article 20 of the 1980 Hague Convention which provides:</a></p><a name="para155"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The return of the child under the provisions of article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Although this article is not expressly incorporated by the 1985 Act, it has been given domestic effect by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 which makes it unlawful for any public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with the ECHR, so that a court (as a public authority) is bound to give effect to ECHR rights wherever they appear, including the rights in article 20 (<i>In re D</i> at para 65). If a taking parent has been subjected to, for instance, abuse by the left-behind parent, or abuse from her own family members, then the issues which could be raised under article 20 are, as the Court of Appeal stated at para 41, amply reflected in the operation of article 13(b). I need only refer to what Lord Wilson said at para 34 of <i>In re S 2012</i>:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The application of article 13(b) ensures that the court is not acting in a way which is incompatible with the ECHR. The 1980 Hague Convention proceedings are focused upon the child, but that focus itself involves consideration of the position of the taking parent. Article 20 is not to be used as a way around the rigours of the other exceptions to return of the child.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para155"></a><a name="para156">156.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was submitted on behalf of the mother that her reliance on article 20 hinges upon determination of her application for asylum, and consideration by the Secretary of State as to whether G should be granted asylum. I disagree. It is clear that no judgment of the court shall be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of refugee or subsidiary protection. That is exclusively a matter for the Secretary of State. However, whilst the court does not determine the request for international protection it does determine the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings so that where issues overlap the court can come to factual conclusions on the overlapping issues so long as the prohibition on determining the claim for international protection is not infringed. In this way an exclusive focus on the merits of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings must in certain cases also require consideration of the facts giving rise to the claim for international protection. I consider that the mother’s arguments based on the ECHR properly analysed arise under article 13(b) and they can be addressed in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. There is no reason why those proceedings cannot be heard and determined prior to a decision in relation to the requests for international protection.</a></p><a name="para156">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">For my part I consider that the court can consider the merits of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings even if the factual issues overlap with the asylum claims, so long as the prohibition on determining the claim for international protection is not infringed.</p>

However, the general proposition is entirely consistent with the aims and objectives of the 1980 Hague Convention including the obligations of expedition and priority. Also, it has the benefit of making available to the Secretary of State a reasoned High Court decision on the evidence available to it, and tested to an extent by an adversarial process, of an application for summary return.</a></p><a name="para160">

<p class="ParaHeading">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical points as to the interplay between the two proceedings</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para162"></a><a name="para163">163.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point is that the Secretary of State has sole responsibility for both examining and determining claims for international protection: see paragraph 328 of the Immigration Rules (referred to at para 93 above). The Secretary of State’s responsibilities include examining and determining whether refugee status or subsidiary protection should be revoked: see article 1C of the 1951 Geneva Convention, articles 11, 14, 16 and 19 of the Qualification Directive and paragraphs 338A and 339A of the Immigration Rules. As the Court of Appeal stated at para 123 “the court has been properly sensitive to the fact that decision-making functions have been assigned to particular primary decision-makers by Parliament or under powers emanating from Parliament; and has been clear that the court has no power to review or otherwise interfere with the decision-making of that body except on a statutory appeal or on conventional judicial review grounds”. The Court of Appeal also stated at para 124 that “all decisions relating to asylum applications (including decisions to withdraw or revoke asylum status) fall within the exclusive powers of the Secretary of State, no court or tribunal has any power to intervene outside the statutory appeal process set out in the 2002 Act”.</a></p><a name="para163"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para163"></a><a name="para164">164.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings are separate from the asylum process. Frequently, the same factual background forms the basis for both (i) an application for asylum by a child and (ii) a “defence” to an application for a return order under article 13(b) (grave risk to the child). In determining an application for a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention, the court does not impinge in any way upon the Secretary of State’s exclusive function in determining refugee status. Rather, information in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and the court’s decision may inform the determination by the Secretary of State of a person’s asylum claim or as to whether the Secretary of State revokes refugee status. Similarly, information available to the Secretary of State such as country background information (though in this case that information is publicly available) and the decision of the Secretary of State may inform the court’s decision in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings.</a></p><a name="para164">

I consider that proceedings are related once it becomes apparent that an application for asylum has been made by a parent (regardless of whether the child is objectively understood to have made an application or been named as a dependant) or by a child.</a></p><a name="para165"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para165"></a><a name="para166">166.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as soon as it is appreciated that there are related 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and asylum proceedings it will generally be desirable that the Secretary of State be requested to intervene in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. It was suggested in this court that the Secretary of State should be joined as a party. In <i>In</i> <i>re H (A Child) (International Abduction: Asylum and Welfare)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/988.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 988</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/988.html">[2017] 2 FLR 527</a>, which also involved a related asylum application, Black LJ (with whom Moore-Bick, Longmore LJJ agreed) posed the question at para 39 as to whether it was necessary for the Secretary of State to be joined in the proceedings, “not least with the intent that the family court’s determination should be binding upon her too?”. That issue, amongst others was remitted to the High Court. However, by the time of the remitted hearing “a very broad level of agreement had been reached between the parties” so this question fell away, see <i>F v M (Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants intervening)</i>. If joining the Secretary of State as a party to the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings would result in the court’s determination being binding on her then the question arises as to whether this would infringe upon her sole responsibility for both examining and determining claims for international protection. We have not heard submissions on this point so for present purposes I consider that it is sufficient if the Secretary of State ordinarily be requested to intervene so ensuring that the decisions in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings did not trespass on her responsibilities in the asylum process.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para167">167.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, other steps which in general it is desirable should be taken as soon as it is appreciated that there are related proceedings include:</a></p><a name="para167"> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ensuring that there is liaison and a clear line of communication between the courts and the Home Office;</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Joining the child as party to the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings with representation; and</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para167"></a><a name="para168">168.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, I endorse the steps which the Home Office has taken post-hearing towards establishing a specialist asylum team to which this small group of cases would be assigned as soon as it is appreciated that there is an overlap with 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. This would replicate the approach in the courts in that all 1980 Hague Convention cases are heard in the Family Division of the High Court.</a></p><a name="para168"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para168"></a><a name="para169">169.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the documents in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings should ordinarily be made available to the Secretary of State.</a></p><a name="para169"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para169"></a><a name="para170">170.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the court should give early consideration to the question as to whether the asylum documents should be disclosed in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. Article 22 of the Procedures Directive provides that:</a></p><a name="para170"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<i>For the purposes of examining individual cases</i>, member states shall not: (a) directly disclose information regarding individual applications for asylum, or the fact that an application has been made, to <i>the alleged actor(s) of persecution of the applicant for asylum</i>; (b) obtain any information from the alleged actor(s) of persecution in a manner that would result in such actor(s) being directly informed of the fact that an application has been made by the applicant in question, and would jeopardise the physical integrity of the applicant and his/her dependants, or the liberty and security of his/her family members still living in the country of origin.” (Emphasis added)</p> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para170">In <i>R v McGeough</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/62.html">[2015] UKSC 62</a>; [2016] NI 280; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/62.html">[2015] 1 WLR 4612</a>, para 23 Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, giving the judgment of the court stated that “the stipulation [in article 22] is that it should not be disclosed to alleged actors of persecution <i>and the injunction against its disclosure is specifically related to the process of examination of individual cases</i>. The appellant’s case had been examined and his application had been refused. <i>The trigger for such confidentiality as article 22 provides for was simply not present</i>” (emphasis added). Paragraph 3391A of the Immigration Rules transposes article 22 into domestic law. That paragraph has a similar trigger containing the same limitation “For the purposes of examining individual applications …”. The preliminary words of both article 22 and the paragraph qualify the prohibitions confining confidentiality of the asylum documents to the asylum process. The provisions of article 22 and paragraph 3391A are intended to give instructions as to how to deal with the information when considering applications for asylum. They do not prevent a court from ordering disclosure nor is it necessary to postpone disclosure until the asylum process has concluded. The Court of Appeal <i>In the matter of H (A Child) (Disclosure of Asylum Documents)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/1001.html">[2020] EWCA Civ 1001</a>, para 68(3), relying on <i>R v McGeough</i> stated that “Absolute confidentiality only applies during the process of examination of the asylum application”. However, that confidentiality only applies for the purposes of examining individual cases within the asylum process. The article 22 trigger does not apply to the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. There will be other aspects of confidentiality which are set out in<i> In the matter of H (A Child) (Disclosure of Asylum Documents)</i>. Therefore, the court at an early stage of a 1980 Hague Convention application should consider disclosure of the asylum documentation in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings, applying the balancing exercise set out in <i>In the matter of H (A Child) (Disclosure of Asylum Documents)</i>.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para171">171.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In carrying out the balancing exercise a relevant factor will be whether the left-behind parent in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings is “the alleged [actor] of persecution of the applicant for asylum”.</a></p><a name="para171"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para171"></a><a name="para172">172.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, in carrying out the balancing exercise it will ordinarily be appropriate to identify the information contained in the asylum application which is distinct from and additional to the information that the taking-parent has already disclosed in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings (“the additional information”). There is an obligation on the legal representatives in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings to consider the asylum documents to identify the additional information and ordinarily it is the confidentiality of the additional information that must be balanced.</a></p><a name="para172"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para172"></a><a name="para173">173.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>UNHCR in its written submissions dated 10 February 2021 referred to “the vital importance of confidentiality in the asylum process” explaining by reference to the UNHCR <i>Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status and Guidelines on International Protection under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees</i> (reissued in 2019) at para 200 that “[i]t will be necessary for the examiner to gain the confidence of the applicant in order to assist the latter in putting forward his case and in fully explaining his opinions and feelings. In creating such a climate of confidence, it is, of course, of the utmost importance that the applicant’s statements will be treated as confidential and that he be so informed.” UNHCR considered and I agree that any disclosure exercise conducted in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings would need to balance the systemic importance of maintaining confidentiality in the asylum process, together with the applicant parent’s and the child’s particular right to confidentiality in that process against the left-behind parent’s rights under articles 6 and 8 ECHR and the child’s rights under article 8 ECHR.</a></p><a name="para173"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para173"></a><a name="para174">174.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, as submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State “… the difficulty that arises relates to harmonising, in so far as possible, the speed of the decision-making processes under the respective Conventions …”. All the parties and interveners in this case recognised the need for mechanisms to enable the court and the Secretary of State to co-ordinate their respective proceedings, to secure expedition in both. Prompted by this uniform recognition this court invited the parties and the interveners to suggest standard directions in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings where there is a parallel asylum claim. Extensive work was undertaken by counsel in relation to suggestions for standard directions. Furthermore, on behalf of the Secretary of State an “Expedited process for determining asylum claims with concurrent Hague Convention proceedings” was devised with such asylum claims being allocated to “a specific decision-making team who will hold responsibility for expedited cases (the Expedited Team)”. However, whilst there was a measure of agreement as to standard directions there has been no wider consultation and matters of practice and procedure are not for this court. It is for the High Court to determine its own procedures, which no doubt will take into consideration the matters set out by the Court of Appeal at paras 164 and 166. However, the exercise in this court identified (as set out in Appendix Two) some problem areas which might be considered together with some purely tentative suggestions in those areas for consideration by others.</a></p><a name="para174"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para174"></a><a name="para175">175.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seventh, in cases linked to 1980 Hague Convention proceedings consideration should be given to ensuring that any asylum appeal or any asylum judicial review will normally be assigned, in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, to a Family Division High Court judge (though not the same judge with conduct of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings). I make an equivalent recommendation in respect of Scotland that would mean that any asylum appeal or any asylum judicial review in cases linked to 1980 Hague Convention proceedings be normally assigned to a judge from the Court of Session with experience of family cases.</a></p><a name="para175"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para175"></a><a name="para176">176.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It should be possible to implement such an appeal procedure using existing statutory provisions. By virtue of section 6(1)(c) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (the “2007 Act”) a judge of the Court of Session and by virtue of section 6(1)(d) a puisne judge of the High Court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland are also judges of both the FtT and of the UT. Furthermore, a High Court judge or a judge of the Court of Session may act as a judge of the FtT if requested to do so by the Senior President of Tribunals: see paragraph 6(2), Schedule 2 of the 2007 Act. The request must be made with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: paragraph 6(3)(a), Schedule 2 of the 2007 Act (or the concurrence of the Lord President of the Court of Session for a judge of the Court of Session: paragraph 6(3)(b), Schedule 2 of the 2007 Act or the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, for a High Court judge in NI: paragraph 6(3)(c), Schedule 2 of the 2007 Act). As the legislation does not distinguish between High Court judges of particular divisions the need for a Family Division judge would simply be reflected in the particular High Court judge whom the Senior President of Tribunals requests to sit with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice in England and Wales, or of the Lord President of the Court of Session, or of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.</a></p><a name="para176"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para176"></a><a name="para177">177.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eighth, it is desirable that the High Court should have oversight over and be in a position to co-ordinate both proceedings until both have been concluded. For instance, if the Secretary of State refuses a child refugee status and if the child appeals to the FtT then it will be a matter for the High Court judge to bring the matter urgently to the attention of the Senior President of Tribunals and of the Lord Chief Justice requesting that a Family Division High Court judge acts in the FtT.</a></p><a name="para177"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disposal of the appeal</p>

Gwynneth Knowles J makes an order on paper adjourning the issue of disclosure to a further hearing on 5 June 2020. I would suggest that as soon as it becomes apparent that there is a related asylum claim the court should ordinarily consider (i) informing the Secretary of State of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings so that she is aware of the need for expedition and priority in relation to the asylum process; (ii) requesting the Secretary of State to intervene in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings so that there can be co-ordination with the asylum process; (iii) setting a review date and requesting the Secretary of State by her representative to attend at that review; (iv) indicating that at the review consideration will be given to making available to the Secretary of State all the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings documents and that consideration will also be given as to whether the asylum documentation should be released to the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings; (v) requesting the Secretary of State to keep the court informed as to each stage of the asylum process; (vi) informing the Secretary of State of the court’s objective to keep her informed as to each stage of the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings; (vii) informing the Secretary of State that if appropriate the court will assist by using its case management powers in order to advance the asylum process by, for instance, giving directions in relation to any medical report that may inform both the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and the asylum process.</p>

The mother’s legal representatives in relation to the asylum request are not present. I suggest that ordinarily consideration might be given as to whether they ought to attend. Lieven J made an order staying the father’s 1980 Hague Convention application pending determination of the asylum claim. Lieven J requested the Secretary of State to determine the outstanding asylum claim “with maximum speed”. I would suggest that any request for “maximum speed” is accompanied by setting a review date to be attended by the parties including any legal representative of the mother in relation to the asylum application with a request that the Secretary of State attends by her representative to inform the court as to progress and of any difficulties in the asylum process. For instance, consideration at such a review hearing could have been given by all those attending to an immediate remote interview of the mother by the case-working team, arrangements for a medical examination of the mother for the purposes of the asylum claim and arrangements for biometrics.</p>
