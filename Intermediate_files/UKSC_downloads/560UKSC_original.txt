<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“We lead women’s lives: we have no choice”. Thus has the Chief Justice
of Canada, the Rt Hon Beverley McLachlin, summed up the basic truth that women
and men do indeed lead different lives. How much of this is down to
unquestionable biological differences, how much to social conditioning, and how
much to other people’s views of what it means to be a woman or a man, is all
debateable and the accepted wisdom is perpetually changing. But what does not
change is the importance, even the centrality, of gender in any individual’s
sense of self. Over the centuries many people, but particularly women, have
bitterly resented and fought against the roles which society has assigned to
their gender. Genuine equality between the sexes is still a work in progress.
But that does not mean that such women or men have not felt entirely confident
that they are indeed a woman or a man. Gender dysphoria is something completely
different - the overwhelming sense that one has been born into the wrong body,
with the wrong anatomy and the wrong physiology. Those of us who, whatever our
occasional frustrations with the expectations of society or our own biology,
are nevertheless quite secure in the gender identities with which we were born,
can scarcely begin to understand how it must be to grow up in the wrong body
and then to go through the long and complex process of adapting that body to
match the real self. But it does not take much imagination to understand that
this is a deeply personal and private matter; that a person who has undergone
gender reassignment will need the whole world to recognise and relate to her or
to him in the reassigned gender; and will want to keep to an absolute minimum
any unwanted disclosure of the history. This is not only because other people
can be insensitive and even cruel; the evidence is that transphobic incidents
are increasing and that transgender people experience high levels of anxiety
about this. It is also because of their deep need to live successfully and
peacefully in their reassigned gender, something which non-transgender people
can take for granted.</a></p><a name="para1">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This case is about how the Department for Work and Pensions (the DWP),
in administering our complex welfare benefits system, treats people with a
reassigned gender, and specifically whether certain policies conflict (1) with
the Gender Recognition Act 2004; (2) with the Human Rights Act 1998; or (3)
with the Equality Act 2010. Those policies have undergone change in the course
of these proceedings, as have the arguments presented, and so the issues before
this Court are in some respects different from the issues before the High Court
and the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

transition began in 2003 and she changed her name in 2004. She has undergone
full gender reassignment treatment and surgery, which in her case included
facial feminisation surgery, in her words because it was “incredibly important”
to her “easily to ‘pass’ as a woman”. Her gender recognition certificate (GRC)
was one of the first to be issued under the Gender Recognition Act 2004. The
Gender Recognition Panel notified both the Inland Revenue (now HMRC) and the
DWP of the change.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>She was employed in a variety of roles, some managerial, until she
became unemployed in June 2010. Since then, apart from a period of employment
in 2015-2016, she has been in receipt of Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA), a benefit
which is administered by the DWP through Jobcentre Plus (JCP) offices. As a
condition of receiving JSA, she has to attend a JCP office in person every two
weeks. Her principal concern in these proceedings is with the way in which her
history is recorded by the DWP and the effect that this can have on her
interactions with its officials. She has had a number of distressing
experiences which indicate that DWP policies do not effectively protect the
privacy of her status but rather tend to draw attention to it.</a></p><a name="para4">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The DWP uses a centralised database, the Customer Information System
(CIS), to record information relating to each of its “customers” and everyone
else who has a National Insurance number. The CIS interfaces or links to a
number of other computer systems, including over 40 systems within government
and quasi-government departments, local authorities and HMRC, as well as to
benefit-specific computer systems, including the Jobseeker’s Allowance Payments
system (JSAPS) which is used to administer JSA. About 140,000 persons are
authorised to access the CIS.</a></p><a name="para5">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The information recorded on the CIS about a customer includes his or her
current sex, the fact that he or she was previously recorded as having a
different sex (if applicable), his or her current name and title, and his or
her former names and titles (if applicable), the fact that a person has a GRC,
its date of issue and date of notification to DWP, and (where this is the case)
the reason for a change of recorded sex being gender reassignment. These data,
including the data recording a change of gender, are held for the life of the
individual concerned and for 50 years and one day thereafter. This has been
referred to as “the Retention policy” in these proceedings.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When these proceedings were begun, as long ago as 2012, the fact of a
GRC and the reason for a change of sex being gender reassignment were noted in
such a way as to be visible to front-line users of the CIS, such as staff at
the JCP offices. This has been referred to as the “GRC Noting policy” in these
proceedings. As a result of these proceedings and changes to the DWP’s IT
supplier arrangements, those matters are no longer visible to front-line staff
and so the “GRC Noting policy” is no longer under challenge. However, any
previous name, title or gender is visible and in the great majority of cases
the reason for a change of name, title and gender will be gender reassignment.
Hence, without an extra layer of protection, front-line staff could readily
infer that gender reassignment had taken place.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That extra layer of protection is achieved through the DWP’s Special
Customer Records Policy (referred to in these proceedings as the SCR policy).
This sets out special procedures for dealing with the records of certain
categories of customer who require extra protection, for example because
unauthorised disclosure of their records could result in substantial distress
or physical harm. The categories of customer to which the policy may be applied
include, for example, victims of domestic or honour based violence and people
with witness protection orders. But it is not applied automatically to all such
people, as we are told that the great majority of those to whom the policy is
applied are transgender. It is, however, applied automatically to all those
recorded on the CIS as having a GRC, unless and until the customer asks for it
to be disapplied. The protection is therefore optional, but without it a
person’s gender history would be readily discernible by staff who needed to
access the CIS.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the SCR policy, an individual’s CIS record receives a protected
marking, ranging (at the material time) from private, restricted, confidential,
secret to top secret. Transgender records were marked restricted. Persons
wishing to access them must be specifically authorised and must have a legitimate
business reason for doing so; access is limited to a specific purpose or
purposes; and it is time-limited for a period not exceeding four hours.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Access to an individual’s CIS record is not required for the routine
issue of benefit payments, including JSA. However, an adviser will need to
access the CIS in order to make routine changes to relevant information, such
as a change of address or contact details. For an SCR customer, this will
require the same authorisation process as described in para 12 below.
Authorisations are monitored, so that inappropriate or unauthorised access can
be discovered, and this may result in disciplinary action.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Typically, the administration of claims for JSA requires a JCP adviser
to access two systems, the JSAPS and the Labour Market System (LMS). These are
both affected by the SCR policy. The LMS records information about the steps
taken by the customer to obtain employment. But it does not do so for customers
who are subject to the SCR Policy. Instead, their efforts to find work are
recorded manually on paper. When the customer’s LMS record is accessed, a
warning of “additional protection facility from unauthorised viewing” will pop
up directing the adviser to the paper record, which will only be accessed once
authorisation is given.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The JSAPS records information which enables an adviser to assess
entitlement to JSA and authorise payment. When an adviser accesses JSAPS to
authorise payment to a customer subject to the SCR policy, an error message
pops up warning “Sensitive account - You are not authorised to view it”. Access
is then gained through the authorisation process: this involves applying to the
DWP’s specialist IT team for temporary access to Special Customer Records.
Access is usually available within an hour but it can take considerably longer.
The adviser is warned again that the account is sensitive and no-one else
should view it.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On access, the front screen does not display previous names, titles or
gender or the issue of a GRC and normally there would be no need to search for
historical claim data. If there is such a need, the historical gender identity
data will only be available where a claim was made for JSA under a previous
name, title or gender and this claim is still live. It will not be displayed
where the claim was made after the change of gender (as in the case of this
appellant).</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that any JCP adviser processing a JSA claim is bound to learn
that the customer is subject to the SCR policy. The adviser will not usually
know why that is the case, but may well be able to “put two and two together”.
The operation of the policy causes inconvenience and delay in accessing
benefits: delays of an hour are usual and they can be as much as three days.
Late payment is, to say the least, a serious inconvenience to anyone on the
tight budget required of JSA claimants. Ringing up to find out why payment has
been delayed can also be a serious inconvenience as the authorisation process
has to be followed in order for the telephone advisers to access the account.
The alternatives to physically attending at the JCP offices are very limited.
The appellant has on at least three occasions asked to be allowed to sign on by
post but been refused.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant also reports some very distressing incidents in JCP
offices. On several occasions she has overheard references to her transgender
status in conversations in open plan offices with other customers present. Once
her status has become known within an office she has felt compelled to transfer
to another office to protect her privacy and dignity and, indeed, her physical
safety. She adds that she has had some very positive experiences with
individual DWP staff members, but every interaction with them, good or bad, is
against that background of insecurity and anxiety. The evidence she has placed
before the courts in these proceedings, both from experts in the field of
gender dysphoria and from other transgender customers, shows not only the depth
of these concerns but also that she is not alone in having them.</a></p><a name="para15">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After considerable correspondence exploring possible alterations to the
DWP’s policies, these proceedings were launched in April 2012. They were then
stayed in order that the DWP could review its policies on data retention and
implement any changes. This review concluded that the DWP needed to improve its
treatment of transgender customers but did not propose any change to the
Retention, GRC Noting or SCR policies in respect of them.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claim was heard by Simon J in May 2014: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2014/2403.html">[2014] EWHC 2403 (Admin)</a>.
All three policies were challenged as being (1) in breach of articles 8 and/or
14 of the European Convention on Human Rights; and (2) directly and indirectly
discriminatory contrary to the Equality Act 2010. It was common ground that the
Retention and Noting policies engaged the right to respect for private life
protected by article 8(1). Simon J held that they were not sufficiently clear,
precise and accessible to be “in accordance with the law” for the purpose of
justifying them under article 8(2) and granted a declaration to that effect.
However, he held that they pursued the legitimate aims of enabling accurate
calculations of state pension entitlement and of reducing opportunities for
identity theft and benefit fraud and were a proportionate means of doing so. He
was more doubtful whether the SCR policy even engaged article 8(2), as it was
designed to protect privacy, rather than to interfere with it, although it did
tend to have the opposite effect of drawing attention to transgender customers;
but he held that it was in any event justified by the need to protect DWP
staff. He rejected the claim based on direct discrimination, because the appellant
was not treated less favourably than other customers because of her gender
reassignment. He was prepared to assume that the policies were indirectly
discriminatory, in that they put transgender customers at a particular
disadvantage when compared with others, but they were justified under the 2010
Act for the same reasons that they were justified under the Convention.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between the High Court judgment and the hearing of the appellant’s
appeal to the Court of Appeal in December 2015, as already noted, the DWP
altered its policy and systems so that the fact of a GRC was no longer visibly
noted on the CIS (although other facts from which such an inference could be
drawn remained). The challenge to the GRC Noting policy was therefore no longer
a live issue before the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the Retention policy had
been clarified and was now accessible, so the issue of legality was no longer
live. On 9 February 2016, the appeal was unanimously dismissed. The only
judgment was given by Elias LJ, with whom Patten and Black LJJ agreed: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/47.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 47</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/47.html">[2016] PTSR 1344</a>. He accepted that article 8 was engaged by both
the Retention and the SCR policies, but agreed with Simon J that the
interference was proportionate. He rejected the argument that article 14
required transgender customers to be treated differently from others. Any
indirect discrimination entailed in the SCR policy was justified for the same
reasons that the interference with article 8 rights was justified. A new
argument, that the policies were contrary to the requirement in section 9 of
the Gender Recognition Act 2004 that where a full gender recognition
certificate is issued, “the person’s gender becomes for all purposes the
acquired gender” was rejected: this did not require history to be rewritten.</p>

</span>Before this court, the appellant challenges the Retention and SCR
policies on three grounds: (1) inconsistency with sections 9 and 22 of the
Gender Recognition Act 2004; (2) incompatibility with the rights under articles
3, 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (article 3 is raised for
the first time in this court); and (3) infringement of section 13, 19 or 26 of
the Equality Act 2010 (direct discrimination under section 13 was not pursued
before the Court of Appeal but is raised again before this court; harassment
under section 26 is an entirely new argument).</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>This Act, as is well-known, was passed in response to the judgments of
the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Goodwin v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/588.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 447</a> and the declaration of incompatibility made by the House of Lords in <i>Bellinger
v Bellinger </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/21.html">[2003] UKHL 21</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/21.html">[2003] 2 AC 467</a>. It lays down the criteria and
the process by which a person born in one gender may be recognised as having
acquired a different gender. Section 9 provides for the consequences:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a full gender
recognition certificate is issued to a person, that person’s gender becomes for
all purposes the acquired gender (so that, if the acquired gender is the male
gender, the person’s sex becomes that of a man and, if it is the female gender,
the person’s sex becomes that of a women).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection (1) does not
affect things done, or events occurring, before the certificate is issued; but
it does operate for the interpretation of enactments passed, and instruments
and other documents made, before the certificate is issued (as well as those
passed or made afterwards).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection (1) is
subject to provision made by this Act or any other enactment or subordinate
legislation.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 22 deals with the disclosure of “protected information”. Section
22(1) makes it a criminal offence “for a person who has acquired protected
information in an official capacity to disclose that information to any other
person”. Section 22(2) provides that, once a GRC is issued, protected
information includes information which “concerns the person’s gender before it becomes
the acquired gender”. Section 22(3) defines the acquisition of such information
in an official capacity in such a way as to cover officials in the DWP, and
indeed elsewhere in the civil service and otherwise in connection with the
functions of a public authority. Section 22(4) and the Gender Recognition
(Disclosure of Information) (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) Order, SI
2005/635, provide for circumstances in which disclosure is not an offence.
These include: “22(4)(h) the disclosure is made for the purposes of the social
security system or a pension scheme”.</a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant accepts that section 9 “does not rewrite history”. Thus, in
<i>J v C</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/551.html">[2006] EWCA Civ 551</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/551.html">[2007] Fam 1</a>, the issue of a full GRC in the
male gender to a person who was previously female did not retrospectively
validate his prior marriage to another female (at a time when the law did not
provide for same sex marriages), with the result that he did not become the
father of a child born to the other female as a result of artificial
insemination by donor (as would otherwise have been the case under section 27
of the Family Law Reform Act 1987, which provided that the husband of a woman
who gives birth as a result of AID was to be treated for all purposes as the
father of the child). But she argues that section 9(1) does require her <i>now</i>
to be treated for all purposes as a woman and this includes how she is treated
by the DWP for the purpose of claiming and receiving JSA. Section 22(1) is not
an exception to the general principle in section 9(1). Rather it is an
additional protection. It does not follow from the fact that no offence is
committed under section 22 that a policy which is in breach of section 9(1) is
lawful.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The problem with this argument is that section 9(1) clearly contemplates
a change in the state of affairs: before the issue of the GRC a person was of
one gender and after the issue of the GRC that person “becomes” a person of
another gender. The sections which follow section 9 are designed, in their
different ways, to cater for the effect of that change. Thus, for example,
section 12 provides that the acquisition of a new gender does not affect that
person’s status as the father or mother of a child; section 15 provides that it
does not affect the disposal or devolution of property under a will or other
instrument made before the appointed day (thus section 9 will apply to
dispositions made after that date); section 16 provides that the acquisition of
a new gender does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of
honour or property limited to descend with it (unless a contrary intention is
expressed in the will or instrument).</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in section 9 to require that the previous state of
affairs be expunged from the records of officialdom. Nor could it eliminate it
from the memories of family and friends who knew the person in another life.
Rather, sections 10 and 22 provide additional protection against inappropriate official
disclosure of that prior history. Section 10 and Schedule 3 deal with birth
registration. In summary, if there is an entry in the UK birth register
relating to a person to whom a full GRC has been issued, a copy of the GRC must
be sent to the appropriate Registrar General. He or she must make an entry in
the Gender Recognition Register (which is not open to public inspection) which
makes traceable the connection between that entry and the entry in the birth
register. The entry is used to create a new birth certificate which records the
acquired name and gender. Anyone who may have a copy of the UK birth register
entry of a person who has a full GRC may have a copy of the new birth
certificate. This must not disclose the fact that the entry is contained in the
Gender Recognition Register: see Schedule 3, paragraphs 5 and 6.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 22, as we have seen, protects from disclosure by officials
information concerning a person’s gender <i>before</i> it became the acquired
gender. It contains several exceptions, including one for disclosure for the
purpose of the social security system or a pension scheme. Obviously,
therefore, section 9 contemplates that the previous history may be kept on
record, for otherwise there would be no need for the protection given by
section 22.</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I conclude, therefore, that the Retention and SRC policies are not
inconsistent with, or prohibited by, any provision of the Gender Recognition
Act 2004. But that, of course, is not the end of the story.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant rightly emphasises that the 2004 Act was brought about by
developments in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. In <i>Goodwin
v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/588.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 447</a>, the court held (i) that the failure of
UK law to grant legal recognition, including a new birth certificate, to a
post-operative transsexual was a breach of her right to respect for her private
life under article 8; and (ii) that the failure of UK law to permit her to
marry in her acquired gender was a breach of her right to marry under article
12. I would emphasise two passages from the Court’s judgment in relation to
article 8:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“77.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … The stress and
alienation arising from a discordance between the position in society assumed
by a post-operative transsexual and the status imposed by law which refuses to
recognise the change of gender cannot, in the Court’s view, be regarded as a
minor inconvenience arising from a formality. A conflict between social reality
and law arises which places the transsexual in an anomalous position, in which
he or she may experience feelings of vulnerability, humiliation and anxiety.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court was, of course, speaking of the position before the Gender
Recognition Act which sought, so far as possible, to align the legal position with
social and psychological reality. But it makes the important point that this is
no small matter. It is not a minor inconvenience. It goes to the heart of the
person’s sense of self. This is reinforced by a later passage at para 90:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.85pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“… the very essence of the Convention is respect for
human dignity and human freedom. Under article 8 of the Convention in
particular, where the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle
underlying the interpretation of its guarantees, protection is given to the
personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of
their identity as individual human beings. In the 21st century, the right of
transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security in the
full sense enjoyed by others in society cannot be regarded as a matter of
controversy … In short, the unsatisfactory situation in which post-operative
transsexuals live in an intermediate zone [in] not quite one gender or the
other is no longer sustainable.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This puts it beyond doubt that the way in which the law and officialdom
treat people who have undergone gender reassignment is no trivial matter. It
has a serious impact upon their need, and their right, to live, not as a member
of a “third sex”, but as the person they have become, as fully a man or fully a
woman as the case may be.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the courts below, the appellant relied only on the right to respect
for private life, protected by article 8, and the right to enjoy the Convention
rights without discrimination, protected by article 14. In this court, the
statement of facts and issues raises for the first time the question of a
possible violation of article 3, the right not to be subjected to inhuman or
degrading treatment. In her submissions, however, article 3 was deployed to
make the point that there are positive obligations to protect individuals
against such treatment, as indeed there are under article 8. In <i>Identoba v
Georgia </i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2015/474.html">39 BHRC 510</a>, for example, the Strasbourg court found a
breach of article 3 where the authorities had failed to protect LGBTI demonstrators
from attack by homophobic counter-demonstrators. One aim of the SCR policy is
to protect transsexuals against the risk of physical and verbal abuse. The
complaint, as I understand it, is that it may not go far enough in doing so,
whether under article 3 or article 8.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the article 3 cases serve mainly to underline the importance
of the interests at stake here, whether under article 3 or article 8. The real
focus of the argument has been on article 8. In my view, both the Retention and
the SCR policies are an interference with the right of the appellant, and all
people who have undergone gender reassignment, to respect for their private
lives. The SCR policy may be designed to protect the privacy of their deeply
private information but it has the consequence of drawing the attention of
front-line staff, and maybe others in the office, to it. Opting out means that
front-line staff who need it will have unimpeded access to the CIS, in which
the gender history is recorded. So the customer has the choice between
unimpeded access on those occasions when front-line staff need to consult the
CIS and impeded access which in itself draws attention to the possibility, even
the probability, that the claimant has undergone gender reassignment. This is
not a minor interference. On the contrary, it is a very serious matter. It goes
to the heart of how the appellant, and others in her situation, relate to the
world and the world relates to them.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So the real question is whether this interference can be justified by
the operational needs of the benefits system. Two legitimate aims are put
forward by the DWP for the Retention policy. The first is the need to retain
the information for the purpose of calculating entitlement to state retirement
pension. A transgender person has pension rights in his or her acquired gender
from the date of the GRC: Gender Recognition Act 2004, Schedule 5, paragraphs 7
and 8. This means that the date of the GRC will be material to the calculation
of the entitlement of certain customers (those born before 6 December 1953;
female to male transsexuals whose change of gender occurs after they have
reached statutory retirement age for women and before equalisation on 6 March
2019; and male to female transsexuals whose change of gender occurs before 6
March 2010 and before they have reached state pension age for a man but after
they have reached it for a woman). The DWP will need to know the date for the
purpose of checking entitlement at the time and also for checking and
maintaining claims during the customer’s life expectancy thereafter. With the
equalisation of the pension age, there will eventually come a time when this is
no longer necessary, but that is some considerable time in the future. It is
accepted that this does not apply to this particular appellant, but it does
apply to approximately one third of transgender customers, whose state pension
calculation will be directly affected by their birth gender.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second legitimate aim put forward is to identify and detect fraud.
There is a particular risk of identity theft in the case of transgender
customers. A fraudster may obtain a birth certificate in the customer’s
original name and use this, along with other evidence, to obtain a national
insurance number allocated to that name (two linked examples of this were
detected in 2012). The DWP also argue that front-line staff are at the
forefront of detecting frauds - they can sense when something is not right and
need to have access to the information to investigate and detect this.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant accepted that these were legitimate aims in the courts
below and the evidence in support of them was not challenged. In her written
case before this court she argues that these objectives are not sufficiently
important to justify the limitation of a protected right and that those
limitations are not rationally connected to the objectives. She argues that,
now that the fact and date of the GRC is masked on the CIS, it cannot be
necessary to retain the <i>visible</i> gender (name and title) history in order
to calculate state pension entitlement. As for fraud detention and prevention,
there are other ways of verifying the claimant’s identity. Under the new system
for Universal Credit, front-line staff will no longer have access to this
information.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The DWP understandably objects to the introduction of new arguments on
matters which were conceded in the courts below, and on which it has not been
able to file evidence in rebuttal; but they can be addressed briefly. In my
view, for as long as gender is in any way relevant to the entitlement to and
calculation of state retirement pension, it is necessary for the data to be
retained on the CIS system and the rational connection between the two is
obvious. The question of whether it should remain visible to some front-line
staff or whether it is feasible to mask it in some way which nevertheless
enables those who need to see it to be able to do so are questions which go to
the overall balance between the aims pursued and the means used to pursue them,
in other words to the proportionality calculation. As for fraud detection and
prevention, the problem lies, not so much with verifying the identity of the
genuine transgender claimant but with verifying the identity of the fraudulent
claimant who has stolen that person’s previous identity. The legitimacy of the
objectives for which the current computer systems are designed cannot be
affected by the development of wholly new computer systems to support a wholly
new benefits system. Once again, the real issue is not the aim, but the overall
balance between ends and means which is of the essence of the proportionality
calculation.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addressing that balance, several points must be made:</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While I would certainly not minimise the depth of the intrusion where it
takes place, for the most part there is no need for front-line JCP staff to
consult the CIS. Whether or not the SCR policy applies, it is only rarely that
they will need to access the CIS and thereby discover the historic information
recorded there.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The DWP has been engaging with the appellant and those advising her over
many years in an attempt to understand and cater for her concerns. Following
the High Court decision, the GRC data were masked on the CIS. If nothing else,
this litigation has taught the DWP the importance of doing what can be done
within the existing systems to cater for those concerns.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We are here dealing with large computer systems, designed to cater for
vast numbers of customers, which interact with one another in complex ways. It
is no simple matter to modify existing systems in a way which will not
compromise their efficiency and effectiveness. It is one thing to devise a
completely new computer system, such as that now being developed for Universal
Credit, and quite another to modify an old one which has been in operation for
many years.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The DWP’s evidence is that it is not possible to make further
adjustments to the CIS system except at inordinate expense. This court is in no
position to question that.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Most importantly, it is not for this or any other court to administer
the benefits system. That is the business of the DWP. The courts can correct
individual decisions or actions which violate an individual’s human rights: if
a DWP official gained unnecessary or unauthorised access to a customer’s
records, or made improper use of the information obtained through authorised
access, the customer would have a claim under section 6(1) of the Human Rights
Act 1998 against a public authority which had acted incompatibly with her
privacy rights. The courts can also correct legal provisions which violate
human rights (unless contained in an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament). But
the courts can only rarely correct the systems set up by the responsible
government departments or public authorities to administer the law - unless
perhaps they systemically and inevitably result in violations of individuals’
rights. That is not this case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(6)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The courts must inevitably place great weight on the judgment of those
whose business it is to design and administer those systems. They are the
experts in administration and we are not.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment, therefore, the courts below were entitled to reach the
conclusion that the CIS Retention policy was a proportionate means of achieving
its legitimate aims and I share their view. In reaching this conclusion, I in
no way seek to minimise the importance to the appellant and others in her
situation of the intrusion into her privacy which is entailed by the policy.
For her, and for others, it must be good news that the Department has taken
their concerns seriously, and that they will be differently catered for when
Universal Credit is rolled out throughout the country.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The SCR policy and the Retention policy cannot be considered in
isolation from one another. The SCR policy is designed to restrict access to
the CIS to those who are authorised because they have a real need for that
access. This of course has the legitimate aim of protecting the privacy of
those SCR customers who need and want it. This brings with it the problems of
delay, with its attendant inconvenience or even hardship, and it may well draw
attention to the very matter which it is designed to protect. But such problems
are inevitable if access to the CIS is to be restricted. They can be avoided if
the customer does not want the policy to apply, but at the cost of less
restricted access to the CIS. The real question, therefore, is whether the CIS
Retention policy is justified and in my judgment, for the reasons given above,
it is.</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discrimination</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant relies both on discrimination in the enjoyment of
Convention rights, in violation of article 14 of the Convention, and on direct
and indirect discrimination in breach of sections 13 or 19 of the Equality Act
2010 respectively. Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic by virtue
of sections 4 and 7 of the Equality Act and is undoubtedly a “status” for the
purpose of article 14.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Her submission on direct discrimination, under both article 14 and
section 13, is that the policies treat transgender customers in the same way as
other customers when in fact their situations are different and they should be
treated differently. As the Strasbourg court held in <i>Thlimmenos v Greece </i>(2000)
31 EHRR 411, just as like cases must be treated alike, unlike cases must be
treated differently.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The problem with this submission is that the DWP policies <i>do</i>
treat transgender customers differently from others. For those who want it, the
SCR policy applies. In this respect, transgender customers are in no different
position from any of the other vulnerable groups to whom the policy is applied
if wanted and needed. The admitted problems associated with the SCR policy are
the inevitable concomitant of offering them this extra protection for their
privacy. Once again, the real complaint is that, once accessed by those with a
reason to do so, the CIS reveals the customer’s previous name and title, from
which an inference of gender reassignment may, but need not, be drawn.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, it is not clear in what way transgender customers are treated
less favourably than others on the CIS because of their transgender status. The
current names and titles, and any previous names and titles, of all customers
are recorded. Customers change their names and titles for a wide variety of
reasons, not least because of marriage or divorce. All are treated in the same
way. Of course, a change of sex may often be readily deduced from a change of
name and title, whereas other changes may be more speculative. But all relate
to the customer’s private (and sometimes family) life. There is no difference
in treatment from others who change their name or title because of the customer’s
transgender status.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, in my view, Simon J was right to reject the claim of
direct discrimination under both article 14 and section 13 and it is not
surprising that the direct discrimination claim under section 13 was not
pursued, by counsel then appearing for the appellant, before the Court of
Appeal.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The indirect discrimination claim under both article 14 and section 19
of the Equality Act relies upon the particular disadvantage that transsexual
customers suffer as a result of the Retention and SCR policies, either together
or separately, when compared with other customers, whether in general or those
to whom the SCR policy is also applied. I would be prepared to accept, for the
reasons given earlier, that many, if not all, customers who have undergone
gender assignment feel a greater need to protect that information from others
than do customers who have changed their names or titles for other reasons.
Gender reassignment changes one’s identity at a much deeper level than does
getting married, getting divorced, being bereaved, adopting a new name, or any
of the other reasons why a change of name or title may be recorded. It may also
be the case that justification for an interference with the article 8 right is
not invariably justification for discrimination under article 14 or indirect
justification under section 19. However, in this case, the “provision, criterion
or practice” in question, the SCR policy, is a proportionate means of achieving
a legitimate aim for the purpose of section 19(2)(d) and, for the same reasons,
any discrimination involved in the policies is justified for the purpose of
article 14.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the first time in this court, and somewhat faintly, the appellant
argues that the DWP’s policies, and specifically the implicit “outing” involved
in the SCR, create a “harassing environment” contrary to section 26 of the
Equality Act 2010. This allegation was not pleaded in the claim form or argued
in the courts below and is not clearly spelled out in the appellant’s case.
Under section 29(3) of the Equality Act, a service provider must not harass a
person requiring the service or a person to whom the provider is providing the
service. Under section 26(1), “A person (A) harasses another (B) if (a) A
engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, and
(b) the conduct has the purpose or effect of (i) violating B’s dignity, or (ii)
creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive
environment for B”. This is not an allegation which can sensibly be made in a
claim for judicial review of the DWP’s policies in relation to transgender
people. It might be made in a substantive claim under the Equality Act in
relation to the sorts of incidents of which the appellant has complained (and
on occasions received some compensation). Then there would have to be specific
evidence directed towards such a claim and the DWP would have the opportunity
of investigating the complaint and putting in evidence in rebuttal. None of
that has happened in this case. But in any event it is quite clear from the
DWP’s efforts to understand and to meet the appellant’s concerns within the
bounds of practicality that its policies aim to have the reverse effect: to
respect the dignity of transgender customers and to avoid creating an
intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for
them. There are disciplinary measures in place for staff who are guilty of such
behaviour. In other words, if such behaviour takes place, it is not the system
which is to blame.</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the concerns which the appellant has raised before and
during these proceedings are very real and important to her, and no doubt to
other transgender customers of the DWP. The proceedings have already brought
about some change in DWP policy and no doubt the DWP will continue to consider
how the service it offers to transgender customers could be improved. The
introduction of Universal Credit is an opportunity to do this. But for all the
reasons given earlier the Retention and SCR policies are not unlawful under
either the Human Rights Act 1998 or the Equality Act 2010 and this appeal must
be dismissed.</a></p><a name="para46">
