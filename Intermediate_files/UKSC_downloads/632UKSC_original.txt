This appeal concerns the provisions of section 246A of the 2003 Act which deal with early release from prison of those serving extended determinate sentences. The effect of the provisions is that Mr Stott will not be eligible to apply for release until he has served two-thirds of his custodial term, in contrast to other categories of prisoner who can apply for release at an earlier point in their custodial term. He contends that the provisions of section 246A are discriminatory and in violation of article 14 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR” or “the Convention”) taken together with article 5 of the Convention. </a></p><a name="para1">

Prior to the trial, he had pleaded guilty to other counts relating to indecent photography of a child. On 23 May 2013, he was sentenced to an extended determinate sentence (“EDS”) in respect of ten counts of rape. An EDS comprises two elements, namely an “appropriate custodial term”, and a further period for which the offender is to be subject to a licence (“the extension period”), see section 226A(5) at para 85 below. Mr Stott’s appropriate custodial term has been fixed at 21 years, with an extension period of four years. He was also sentenced to various determinate sentences of imprisonment to be served concurrently. He was refused permission to appeal against his sentence, see <i>R v Stott </i>[2016] EWCA Crim 172. </a></p><a name="para2">

It will be necessary to look further at the statutory provisions governing release later but, in broad outline, section 246A of the 2003 Act requires, in most cases, that the EDS prisoner be released on licence as soon as he has served the “requisite custodial period” and the Parole Board has directed his release. The requisite custodial period is two-thirds of the appropriate custodial term specified by the sentencing court, so Mr Stott would have to serve 14 years before becoming eligible for parole. Other categories of prisoner are, in contrast, eligible for parole at the half-way point in their sentences. If these rules had applied to Mr Stott, he would have been eligible for parole once he had served ten and a half years. He complained that there was no justification for this difference in treatment in relation to eligibility for parole, and that it was unlawful discrimination within article 14. He brought judicial review proceedings. </a></p><a name="para3">

First, the circumstances must fall within the ambit of a Convention right. Secondly, the difference in treatment must have been on the ground of one of the characteristics listed in article 14 or “other status”. Thirdly, the claimant and the person who has been treated differently must be in analogous situations. Fourthly, objective justification for the different treatment will be lacking. It is not always easy to keep the third and the fourth elements entirely separate, and it is not uncommon to see judgments concentrate upon the question of justification, rather than upon whether the people in question are in analogous situations. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead captured the point at para 3 of <i>R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/37.html">[2005] UKHL 37</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/37.html">[2006] 1 AC 173</a>. He observed that once the first two elements are satisfied: </p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the essential question for the court is whether the alleged discrimination, that is, the difference in treatment of which complaint is made, can withstand scrutiny. Sometimes the answer to this question will be plain. There may be such an obvious, relevant difference between the claimant and those with whom he seeks to compare himself that their situations cannot be regarded as analogous. Sometimes, where the position is not so clear, a different approach is called for. Then the court’s scrutiny may best be directed at considering whether the differentiation has a legitimate aim and whether the means chosen to achieve the aim is appropriate and not disproportionate in its adverse impact.” </p>

The debate is about the application of article 14. Two issues have been identified. The first issue (“Issue 1” or “the status issue”) is whether </span>the different treatment of Mr Stott is on a ground within the meaning of “other status” in article 14. The second issue (“Issue 2”) requires determination only if Issue 1 is answered in the affirmative. It has two parts: </a></p><a name="para9">

The Secretary of State argues that Mr Stott fails on the status issue, so Issue 2 does not arise. However, if that is wrong, the Secretary of State argues that Mr Stott’s sentence is not analogous to the other sentences under consideration, and that there is in any event an objective justification for treating the different categories of prisoner differently. </a></p><a name="para10">

In 2006, in <i>R (Clift) </i>, the House of Lords held that Mr Clift’s classification, as a long-term prisoner serving a determinate sentence of 15 years or more, did not amount to an “other status”, and accordingly there was no infringement of article 14.

Some way into his period of imprisonment, the Parole Board recommended his release on parole. Had Mr Clift been serving a term of less than 15 years, or life imprisonment, the Secretary of State would have had a statutory obligation to comply with the recommendation of the Parole Board. However, by virtue of various statutory provisions and the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998 (SI 1998/3218), the final decision in relation to prisoners serving determinate terms of 15 years or more lay with the Secretary of State, who rejected the recommendation. Mr Clift contended that the early release provisions discriminated against him in breach of his rights under articles 5 and 14 of the ECHR by denying him the right, that other long-term prisoners enjoyed, to be released if the Parole Board recommended it. </a></p><a name="para15">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Clift was able to establish that his rights in relation to early release were within the ambit of article 5. Although there is no issue about article 5 in the present case, a brief resumé of how the House of Lords approached it will set the article 14 issues in a proper context. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill said at para 17, the ECHR does not require member states to establish a scheme for early release, and prisoners may, consistently with the Convention, be required to serve the entirety of the sentence passed, if that is what the domestic law provides. However, where the domestic law in fact provides for a right to seek early release, that right is within the ambit of article 5. In relation to long-term prisoners serving determinate terms, the law of England and Wales did confer a right to seek early release, setting a time at which a prisoner must be released as of right, and an earlier time at which he might be released if it was judged safe to do so. Accordingly, as Lord Bingham said at para 18, differential treatment, in relation to early release, of one prisoner as compared with another, otherwise than on the merits of their respective cases, gave rise to a potential complaint under article 14. </a></p><a name="para16">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the discrimination which article 14 prohibits is discrimination “on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.” Not falling within any of the named grounds, Mr Clift could only bring himself within the protection of article 14 if his differential treatment could be said to be on the ground of “other status”. He argued that this requirement was satisfied on the basis that his treatment was on the ground that he was a prisoner sentenced to a determinate term of 15 years or more. Lord Bingham (with whom there was general agreement, although some other members of the House added reasons of their own) rejected this argument, but he did so “not without hesitation”, and influenced by the fact that the Strasbourg jurisprudence had not endorsed a status of this kind as falling within article 14. Lord Hope of Craighead too, having put the arguments for and against Mr Clift being able to lay claim to status, was mindful of the need for “a measure of self-restraint”, so as not to outstrip Strasbourg. What each would have said, had they known what the ECtHR was going to decide in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>in 2010, is unknown, although one cannot avoid the sense that the outcome might well have been different. However, in order to give proper consideration to what, if any, continuing influence <i>R (Clift) </i>should have, it is necessary to isolate the strands of reasoning which went to make up the conclusion of the House: </a></p><a name="para17">
 <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">i) <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was agreement that the words “or other status” in article 14 (in French “toute autre situation”) are far from precise, but that they are not intended to cover differential treatment on any ground whatever, because in that case, the list of grounds which precede them would be otiose (paras 27, 43, and 56). </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">ii) <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reliance was placed on the passage quoted above from para 56 of <i>Kjeldsen, </i>and the search was for something in the nature of a “personal characteristic by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other” (paras 27, 28, 42, and 56 for example). </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">iii) <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was accepted that, as the specific grounds of discrimination listed in article 14 show, protection is extended not only to characteristics over which a person has no control, such as race or birth, but also to acquired characteristics, such as religion or political opinion (paras 28 and 45). </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">iv) <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Bingham and Lord Hope both advanced the proposition that, to qualify, the personal characteristic in question must exist independently of the treatment of which complaint is made. Lord Bingham said, at para 28, that he did “not think that a personal characteristic can be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains”, without giving any explanation, or authority, for this view. He did not appear to consider that Mr Clift would fall foul of this, as he was not complaining of the sentence passed on him, but of being denied a definitive Parole Board recommendation. Lord Hope agreed, at para 47, that “[i]t must be accepted, as Lord Bingham points out, that a personal characteristic cannot be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains.” Although he similarly did not spell out the foundation for his view, it may lie in his observation, at para 45, that each of the specific grounds shared a feature in common, namely that “they exist independently of the treatment of which complaint is made” and “[i]n that sense, they are personal to the complainant.” The remainder of para 47 is not entirely easy to understand, but might indicate that Lord Hope shared Lord Bingham’s opinion that this was not an area of difficulty for Mr Clift. It reads: </p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is plain too that the category of long-term prisoner into which Mr Clift’s case falls would not have been recognised as a separate category had it not been for the Order which treats prisoners in his group differently from others in the enjoyment of their fundamental right to liberty. But he had already been sentenced, and he had already acquired the status which that sentence gave him before the Order was made that denied prisoners in his group the right to release on the recommendation of the Parole Board. The question which his case raises is whether the distinguishing feature or characteristic which enables persons or a group of persons to be singled out for separate treatment must have been identified as a personal characteristic before it is used for this purpose by the discriminator.” </p>

Baroness Hale included a particularly detailed list of authorities at para 58, which led her to make the observation that in the “vast majority of Strasbourg cases where violations of article 14 have been found, the real basis for the distinction was clearly one of the proscribed grounds or something very close”. Examples were given of cases in which the grounds for the discrimination were not within article 14 (see, for example, paras 27, 45, 59-61), including prisoners who were treated differently because of the legislature’s view of the gravity of their offences ( <i>Gerger v Turkey </i>8 July 1999, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/1999/46.html">[1999] ECHR 46</a>, para 69, and see also <i>Budak v Turkey </i>(Application No <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2257345/00%22]}">57345/00</a>) (unreported), <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1214.html">[2006] ECHR 1214</a>).

I find it difficult to apply so elusive a test. But I would incline to regard a life sentence as an acquired personal characteristic and a lifer as having an ‘other status’, and it is hard to see why the classification of Mr Clift, based on the length of his sentence and not the nature of his offences, should be differently regarded. I think, however, that a domestic court should hesitate to apply the Convention in a manner not, as I understand, explicitly or impliedly authorised by the Strasbourg jurisprudence, and I would accordingly, not without hesitation, resolve this question in favour of the Secretary of State and against Mr Clift.” </p>

 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be said in Mr Clift’s case that the length of his sentence did confer a status on him which can be regarded as a personal characteristic. This is because prisoners are divided by the domestic system into broadly defined categories, or groups of people, according to the nature or the length of their sentences. These categories affect the way they are then dealt with throughout the period of their sentences. As a result they are regarded as having acquired a distinctive status which attaches itself to them personally for the purposes of the regime in which they are required to serve their sentences. This is most obviously so in the case of prisoners serving life sentences and where distinctions are drawn between short-term and long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences. It is less obviously so in the case of long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences of different lengths.” </p>

In his view, “the protection of article 14 ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons or groups of persons differently in the enjoyment of their Convention rights had not previously been recognised”, by which he seems, I think, to have meant “previously recognised by the ECtHR”. But, ultimately, two factors seem to have influenced his rejection of Mr Clift’s case. The first was that he accepted that it was “possible to regard what he has done, rather than who or what he is, as the true reason for the difference of treatment”. The second was caution about outstripping Convention jurisprudence. So, he said, “I am persuaded, with some reluctance, that it is not open to us to resolve the [other status point] in Mr Clift’s favour” (para 49). </a></p><a name="para21">

The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a personal or identifiable characteristic in any given case is a matter to be assessed taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see <i>Artico v Italy </i>, 13 May 1980, para 33, Series A no 37; and <i>Cudak v Lithuania </i>[GC], <span lang="PT-BR">no <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2215869/02%22]}">15869/02</a>, para 36, 23 March 2010 </span>).

In the present case the applicant does not allege a difference of treatment based on the gravity of the offence he committed, but one based on his position as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of more than 15 years.

Mr Minter complained that the application of the indefinite notification period was in breach of article 8 of the ECHR, either read alone or in conjunction with article 14. Although the notification requirement was an interference with his article 8 rights, it was not disproportionate, and the article 8 claim was manifestly ill-founded. However, Mr Minter argued that, by virtue of a change in the law, if he had been sentenced later, he would not have received an extended sentence and would not therefore have been subject to the indefinite notification period at all. That, he submitted, amounted to an unjustified difference in treatment based on “other status”, and to a violation of article 14 taken with article 8. </p>

On the facts, it considered Mr Minter’s assertion that no indefinite notification requirement would have been imposed if he had been sentenced later to be entirely speculative. But even had there not been that obstacle, his claim would have failed. The court began its assessment of the issue in this way: </a></p><a name="para42">
 </a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para42">“66.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for an issue to arise under article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see <i>Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v Russia </i>( </a><a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2260367/08%22]}">60367/08</a> and 961/11) 24 January 2017 at para 64). As established in the court’s case law, only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or ‘status’, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of article 14 (see <i>Khamtokhu and Aksenchik </i>( <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2260367/08%22]}">60367/08</a> and 961/11) 24 January 2017 at para 61). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised ( <i>Khamtokhu and Aksenchik </i>( <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2260367/08%22]}">60367/08</a> and 961/11) 24 January 2017 at para 64).” </p>

In a passage which exhibits, to my mind, the tendency (also seen elsewhere in the Strasbourg jurisprudence on article 14) for consideration of the issue of whether a difference in treatment is on the ground of “other status” to convert, almost seamlessly, into consideration of whether the applicant is in an analogous situation and/or whether the difference is justified, it distinguished the situation in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>: </a></p><a name="para43">

It is true that in <i>Clift </i>the court accepted that the different treatment of different categories of prisoners depending on the sentences imposed was based on ‘other status’ within the meaning of article 14 of the Convention. However, in the present case the different treatment complained of did not concern the length of the applicant’s sentence but rather the different sentencing regime applied to him as a consequence of a new legislation. As such, his article 14 complaint is indistinguishable from that which was declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded in <i>Massey </i>.

After a review of them, I summarise, at para 56 below, the position that the domestic case law seems to have reached on “other status” by the time of the ECtHR’s <i>Clift </i>decision. </a></p><a name="para45">

Perhaps foreshadowing the ejusdem generis argument advanced in <i>Clift </i>, in summarising his conclusion that the requisite “status” had not been established, he observed (para 51) that the “difference in treatment is not analogous to any of the expressly proscribed grounds”. </a></p><a name="para46">

The decision is of interest for Lord Hoffmann’s treatment of the question of whether article 14 was infringed. He considered whether being a person who has started legal proceedings qualified as a status, and was not persuaded that it did. In explaining why, at para 65, he appeared to adopt and develop Lord Steyn’s “analogous” approach which he described as being “that article 14 required discrimination to be by reference to some status analogous with those expressly mentioned, such as sex, race or colour”. </p>

Each of the two claimants complained of a violation of their rights under article 14, read with article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR. One claimant complained of discrimination on the basis of country of residence, and the other on the basis of age. The first was entitled to a retirement pension, but, because she was resident in South Africa, was precluded from receiving the normal annual cost of living increase. The second received state benefits at a lower rate because she was under 25. Their claims failed because the differential treatment of them was rationally justified. However, they did manage to establish that they came within the scope of “other status” in article 14. In the case of the claimant who was resident in South Africa, this is of note because she succeeded in establishing that this was a personal characteristic, notwithstanding that it was in principle a matter of choice and was not immutable. This result was reached through the application of what Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe described as “the <i>Kjeldsen </i>test of looking for a personal characteristic” (para 54). </a></p><a name="para48">

He claimed that the premium was a possession within article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR and that he had been discriminated against contrary to article 14. One of the questions for determination was whether homelessness fell within “other status” for the purposes of article 14. There was an argument as to whether it was necessary to show that it was a “personal characteristic” at all, and, if so, whether it was properly so described.

He said (para 36) that there was no doubt that the House of Lords had consistently proceeded upon the assumption that that was required, basing that approach primarily on the <i>Kjeldsen </i>case. There was also, in his view, a strong case for saying that as a matter of language, article 14 (or at least the English version of it) “appears to envisage precisely this, given the specific grounds on which unjustifiable discrimination is prohibited” (para 37). No case to which the court had been taken supported an argument to the contrary. However, before ultimately adopting that approach himself, Lord Neuberger did acknowledge that there may be a case for another interpretation, saying: </a></p><a name="para52">
 </a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para52">“39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None the less, it is fair to refer to the fact that the French version of article 14 (which has equal status with the English version - see article 59) ends with the words ‘ou toute autre situation’, which may suggest a rather wider scope than ‘or other status’. Further, while the ECtHR judgments relied on by RJM do not establish that no consideration need be given in an article 14 case to the issue of whether the discrimination is by reference to a ‘status’ which can be characterised as a ‘personal characteristic’, some of those judgments could be read as suggesting a rather less structured approach than that which has been adopted by this House. In particular, in an allegation of article 14 infringement, the ECtHR may not always consider whether the alleged discrimination is on the ground of ‘other status’ as an entirely free-standing question: it sometimes appears to approach the overall allegation of infringement on a more holistic or ‘broad brush’ basis: see, for instance, the reasoning in <i>Kjeldsen </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1976/6.html">1 EHRR 711</a>, para 56, and <i>Kafkaris </i>12 February 2008, paras 163-165, as well as <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=17&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=IC6132860E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9"> <i> <span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">Stubbings v United Kingdom </span> </i> <span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/44.html">(1996) 23 EHRR 213</a>  , paras 70-73.” </p>

He said (para 45) that “while reformulations are dangerous”, he considered that the concept of “personal characteristics” “generally requires one to concentrate on what somebody is, rather than what he is doing or what is being done to him”, and that, on that approach, homelessness was an “other status”. He considered (para 46) that this characterisation also fitted with Lord Bingham’s view in <i>Clift </i>that the personal characteristic could not be defined by the differential treatment of which the person complains. He considered (para 47) that the fact that homelessness was a voluntary choice (if it was) was not of much, if any, significance in determining whether it was a status for article 14; some of the specified grounds in the article were matters of choice too. Nor was it telling that homelessness was not a legal status. </a></p><a name="para53">

 </a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para54">“5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point on which I would comment is the expression ‘personal characteristics’ used by the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v Denmark </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1976/6.html">(1976) 1 EHRR 711</a>, and repeated in some later cases. ‘Personal characteristics’ is not a precise expression and to my mind a binary approach to its meaning is unhelpful. ‘Personal characteristics’ are more like a series of concentric circles. The most personal characteristics are those which are innate, largely immutable, and closely connected with an individual’s personality: gender, sexual orientation, pigmentation of skin, hair and eyes, congenital disabilities. Nationality, language, religion and politics may be almost innate (depending on a person’s family circumstances at birth) or may be acquired (though some religions do not countenance either apostates or converts); but all are regarded as important to the development of an individual’s personality (they reflect, it might be said, important values protected by articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention). Other acquired characteristics are further out in the concentric circles; they are more concerned with what people do, or with what happens to them, than with who they are; but they may still come within article 14 (Lord Neuberger instances military status, residence or domicile, and past employment in the KGB). Like him, I would include homelessness as falling within that range, whether or not it is regarded as a matter of choice (it is often the culmination of a series of misfortunes that overwhelm an individual so that he or she can no longer cope). The more peripheral or debateable any suggested personal characteristic is, the less likely it is to come within the most sensitive area where discrimination is particularly difficult to justify. There is an illuminating discussion of these points (contrasting Strasbourg jurisprudence with the American approach to the Fourteenth Amendment) in the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond in <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=17&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I454D1E00434111DD9B21D2EB69D4A35A"> <i> <span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">AL (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span> </i> <span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration: none"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/42.html">[2008] 1 WLR 1434</a>  , paras 20-35.” </p>

He appealed against the suspension of the benefit on the ground that it was in breach of his right not to be discriminated against under article 14 read with article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR. One of the arguments in the Supreme Court was as to whether, if there was discrimination in the treatment of him, it was on the ground of “other status”. It was held that this ground was applicable either by virtue of his status as “a severely disabled child in need of lengthy in-patient hospital treatment” (para 23), or by virtue of his status as “a child hospitalised free of charge … in a NHS … hospital … for a period longer than 84 days” (para 60). At para 21, Lord Wilson said that the prohibited grounds in article 14 extend well beyond innate characteristics, as demonstrated by <i>R (RJM) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/63.html">[2009] AC 311</a>.

Imprisonment for public protection had been abolished prior to him being sentenced, but not for those convicted before 3 December 2012. Amongst other things, he claimed that the differentiation between him and a person convicted of an identical offence on 4 December 2012 was unlawful under article 14. At para 63, Lord Hughes dealt with the question of status and, as will be seen, returned to the idea that it will not be possible to bring oneself within article 14 unless the proposed status exists independently of the treatment about which complaint is made: </p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The appellant submits that this discriminates objectionably against him on grounds of ‘other status’, namely either (i) his status as a convicted person prior to 3 December or (ii) his status as a prisoner who is subject to an indeterminate sentence. Assuming for the sake of argument that status as a prisoner subject to a particular regime can in some circumstances amount to sufficient status to bring article 14 into question <i>(Clift v United Kingdom </i>(Application No <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%227205/07%22]}">7205/07</a>) The Times, 21 July 2005), it cannot do so if the suggested status is defined entirely by the alleged discrimination; that was not the case in <i>Clift. </i>For that reason, the second suggested status cannot suffice. As to the first, even if it be assumed in the appellant’s favour that the mere date of conviction can amount to a sufficient status, which is doubtful, the differential in treatment is clearly justified. All changes in sentencing law have to start somewhere. It will inevitably be possible in every case of such a change to find a difference in treatment as between a defendant sentenced on the day before the change is effective and a defendant sentenced on the day after it. The difference of treatment is inherent in the change in the law. If it were to be objectionable discrimination, it would be impossible to change the law. There are any number of points which may be taken as triggering the change of regime. The point of conviction is clearly one, and the point of sentence is another. Neither is, by itself, irrational or unjustified.” </p>

Proposition (iv) lives on, in <i>R v Docherty </i>, but perhaps needs to be considered further, in the light of its rejection in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>(see further, below). The “analogous” point, which features at proposition (v), is reminiscent of the ejiusdem generis argument advanced in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, but not addressed head-on by the ECtHR. That court’s answer to the argument was, it will be recalled, to give quite wide-ranging examples of situations in which a violation of article 14 had been found. With the continued expansion of the range of cases in which “other status” has been found, in domestic and Strasbourg decisions, the search for analogy with the grounds expressly set out in article 14 might be thought to be becoming both more difficult and less profitable. However, that should not, of course, undermine the assistance that can be gained from reference to the listed grounds, taken with examples of “other status” derived from the case law. It may not be helpful to pursue proposition (vi) abstract; whether it assists will depend upon the facts of a particular case. Proposition (vii) comes into play when considering whether differential treatment is justified, rather than in considering the “other status” question, and need not be further considered at this stage. </a></p><a name="para63">

The words should be given a generous meaning, they submit. They invite attention to the range of situations which have been held, either by the ECtHR or by the domestic courts, to be within the category. Legally acquired statuses have been accepted as sufficient, as demonstrated, for example, by <i>Larkos v Cyprus </i>and <i>Pine Valley Developments Ltd v Ireland </i>, <i>Bah v United Kingdom </i>(all above) and <i>Krajisnik v United Kingdom </i>(2012) 56 EHRR SE7 (status as a prisoner convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia). <i> </i>They also invite attention to the fact that homelessness has been held to be covered, even if it is a matter of choice, ( <i>R (RJM) v </i> <i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>above), and to the status recognised in <i>Mathieson v Secretary of State Work &amp; Pensions </i>(above). And, of course, they rely on the ECtHR’s decision in <i>Clift </i>itself. </a></p><a name="para64">

Whilst this collection of authority establishes that a generous meaning should be given to the words, it also establishes that “other status” is not a catch-all category, see most recently para 61 of <i>Khamtokhu </i>. The central question, so the Secretary of State submits, is whether the basis or reason for the differential treatment is a “personal characteristic by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other”. In the Secretary of State’s submission, article 14 protects “personal characteristics” which are analogous to those expressly mentioned in the article, see para 65 of <i>R (Hooper) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>and para 51 of <i>R (S) v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police </i>. <i> </i>And, it is said, although the concept of a personal characteristic is not a precise one, and is not limited to something innate or inherent, it will typically be more concerned with who a person is, than with what he or she does, see paras 5 and 45 of <i>RJM </i>. Furthermore, the personal characteristic must be independent of the treatment about which complaint is made (para 28 and 45 of <i>Clift </i>in the House of Lords, and para 63 of <i>R v Docherty </i>). </a></p><a name="para67">

The classification of Mr Clift was based upon the length of his sentence, not the nature or gravity of his offence. That set his case apart from cases such as <i>Gerger v Turkey </i>and <i>Budak v Turkey </i>. Mr Stott’s case is different, it is said, because he is not relying on the length of his sentence but on the fact that he is subject to a particular sentencing regime in light of the gravity of his crime and the risk he poses to the community. It is said that the importance of this distinction was affirmed in <i>Minter </i>. Furthermore, unlike with Mr Clift, the treatment of which Mr Stott complains does not exist independently of the characteristic on which he bases his complaint of discrimination, because the release conditions about which he complains flow from his status as a prisoner serving an extended determinate sentence. Mr Clift had already been sentenced, and had thus already acquired his status, before the order was made which led to the different treatment of his group for the purposes of release. </a></p><a name="para68">

For my part, I would now depart from the determination, in <i>R (Clift) </i>, that different treatment on the basis that a prisoner was serving imprisonment of 15 years or more could not be said to be on the ground of “other status”. I am influenced by the ECtHR’s reasoned decision to the contrary, notwithstanding that it was not a decision of the Grand Chamber, but of a section of the court. I am also influenced by the hesitation apparent in the speeches of the House of Lords in <i>R (Clift) </i>, which disclose the constraint that was felt in the absence of any recognition by the ECtHR of a status such as that for which Mr Clift contended. Although one can only speculate as to how the decision would have gone if the ECtHR had already led the way, it is clear that the House could see the force of arguments advanced in Mr Clift’s favour. </a></p><a name="para70">

In considering the decisions of the House of Lords which pre-date <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, it is necessary to keep in mind the ways in which the ECtHR ultimately differed from the House, which I have attempted to set out, commencing at para 33 above. The Supreme Court authorities can be taken to have been decided with <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>in mind. </a></p><a name="para71">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the clearest difference between <i>R (Clift) </i>and <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>was in relation to whether the treatment of which the applicant complains must exist independently of the other status. Counsel for the Secretary of State continue to rely upon this as part of their argument, and they are correct to point out that it features as part of Lord Hughes’ analysis in <i>R v Docherty </i>. The first difficulty about the independent existence condition is the uncompromising rejection of it by the ECtHR, which went on to say that, on the contrary, the matter had to be assessed taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention was to guarantee practical and effective rights. It cited <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i>in support of its stance. The applicant in <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i>was a man who, in 1970, was found by a court to be the father of a girl, paternity then being disproved by a DNA test in 2004. He wanted the finding of paternity overturned, but, unlike fathers whose paternity had been established otherwise than through a court, and mothers, he had no means to achieve this under domestic law. He complained of various breaches of the ECHR, including that he had been discriminated against in the enjoyment of his article 8 and article 6 rights. There was found to be a violation of article 14 taken with article 8. It seems there was no dispute as to the applicability of article 14 (para 51), the dispute having centred on whether the various categories of people were in analogous situations, and whether the difference was justified. Nonetheless, in light of the specific endorsement, in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, of <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i>on the question of status, it is clear that the ECtHR saw the case as an example of a characteristic which did not exist independently of the treatment complained of and yet approved of its categorisation as an “other status”. </a></p><a name="para72">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second difficulty with the independent existence condition is that it made its appearance in <i>R (Clift) </i>unsupported by much, if anything, by way of explanation or supportive authority. Lord Hope might have been building upon his observation, at para 45, that the specific grounds all existed independently of the treatment of which complaint was made. However, whilst some of the grounds named in article 14 clearly <i>will </i>always exist independently of the complaint, I am not at all sure that the same can be said of all of them. “Property” might be a ground which would not always exist independently, and I think there are probably other examples. </a></p><a name="para73">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third difficulty is that the independent existence condition is not at all easy to grasp. Mr Clift satisfied it, because he relied upon being a prisoner serving a determinate term of 15 years or more, and his complaint was about the fact that, by virtue of a subsequent Order, he required the Secretary of State’s approval for his release, rather than automatically being released if the Parole Board recommended it. The homeless person in <i>RJM </i>, who complained about losing his benefits, also satisfied it. However, it was not satisfied, according to <i>Docherty </i>, where the prisoner was relying upon being a prisoner subject to an indeterminate sentence, and complained that he had been discriminated against by virtue of the fact that he could not have been given that sentence had he been convicted after 3 December 2012. Even with these practical examples, it is a challenge to make general sense of the concept, and things do not improve when one takes into account the width of the approach taken in Strasbourg to the ambit of article 14. </a></p><a name="para74">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, I would be cautious about spending too much time on an analysis of whether the proposed status has an independent existence, as opposed to considering the situation as a whole, as encouraged by the ECtHR in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>. In any event, it can properly be said that the status upon which Mr Stott relies exists independently of his complaint, which is about the provisions concerning his early release. By way of example, his extended determinate term of imprisonment does not only dictate the point at which he is eligible for release on parole; it dictates the period he will spend in prison if parole is not granted, and it brings with it also a licence extension. </a></p><a name="para75">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second respect in which the ECtHR differed from the House of Lords was as to whether Mr Clift’s complaint was based upon the gravity of his offence; it said not. The Secretary of State argues that Mr Stott’s case is not the same as Mr Clift’s, as Mr Stott’s complaint is not based on length of sentence, as in Mr Clift’s case, but on his particular sentencing regime, which is dictated by the seriousness of what he did and the risk he poses. </a></p><a name="para76">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded by the Secretary of State’s attempt to liken the case to <i>Gerger </i>and <i>Budak </i>, <i> </i>rather than <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, and to exclude the extended determinate term prisoner on the basis that the differential treatment in his case is because of what he has done and the risk he poses. The ECtHR dealt with the <i>Gerger </i>cases in para 61 of <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, and explained them as all being concerned with special provisions for those accused or convicted of terrorism offences. They also stressed that any exception to the protection offered by article 14 should be narrowly construed. True it is that an extended determinate sentence will only be imposed where there is a particular combination of gravity of offence and risk, but within the category of those serving extended determinate sentences, there will be various types of offence of varying seriousness. Putting it another way, what Mr Stott did has led to him receiving an extended determinate sentence, but, once imposed, that extended determinate sentence exists independently of what he did. If a life sentence is capable of constituting an “acquired personal status”, as Lord Bingham was understandably disposed to think it was (para 28 of <i>R (Clift) </i>), and a determinate term of 15 years is also ( <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>), it is difficult to see why an extended determinate sentence should be viewed differently. </a></p><a name="para77">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think that reliance on <i>Minter </i>assists the Secretary of State in relation to this issue. The complaint in <i>Minter </i>related to a new legislative regime being introduced, which did not benefit the applicant. The selection of a particular date for the commencement of a new legislative regime did not give rise to discrimination when those who were covered by it were treated differently from those who were subject to the old regime. Given the conflating of the various issues of status, analogous situation and justification, in the passage in <i>Minter </i>to which reference is made, it is difficult to be sure whether, in fact, the ECtHR was rejecting the “other status” argument or not, but in any event, the present case does not involve the commencement of a new sentencing regime. </a></p><a name="para78">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, whilst the attributes of the sentencing regime to which Mr Stott is subject will be of central relevance to Issue 2 in due course, for the purposes of determining status, in my view the distinction that the Secretary of State seeks to make between Mr Clift as a prisoner serving 15 years or more and Mr Stott as a prisoner serving an extended determinate term is not a real one. It follows that the decision of the ECtHR in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>is potentially influential in evaluating the present case. </a></p><a name="para79">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the argument that the characteristic needs to be analogous to those listed in article 14, this is difficult to pursue too far in the light of the ECtHR’s acceptance that a prison sentence of a particular length can be within the article. I have no difficulty in accepting that when considering an as yet unconsidered characteristic, a court will have in mind the nature of the grounds it was thought right to list specifically, but the case law that the court cited in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>demonstrates that a strict ejusdem generis interpretation would be unduly restrictive. </a></p><a name="para80">

Secondly, the court must consider that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences (section 226(1)(b)). Thirdly, a life sentence must not be required by section 224A or section 225(2) (section 226A(1)(c)).

Condition B (section 226A(3)) relates to the term that the court would specify as the “appropriate custodial term” if it did impose an extended sentence. By virtue of section 226A(6), the “appropriate custodial term” is the term of imprisonment that would, apart from section 226A, be imposed in compliance with section 153(2). Section 153(2) governs custodial sentences where there is discretion as to the length of sentence, setting out that, as a general rule, the sentence must be for the shortest term commensurate with the seriousness of the offence or combination of offences. Condition B will only apply if the appropriate custodial term that the court would impose would be at least four years. </a></p><a name="para87">

It is a sentence of imprisonment with a term equal to the aggregate of the appropriate custodial term and a further period, called the “extension period”, during which the offender is on licence. Subject to maximum periods set out in section 226A(8), the length of the extension period has to be fixed according to what the court considers necessary for the purpose of protecting members of the public from serious harm occasioned by the offender committing further specified offences. However, by section 226A(9), the term of the extended sentence (appropriate custodial term and extension period) must not exceed the maximum term for the offence (section 226A(9)). </a></p><a name="para88">

In most cases, the section requires that the Secretary of State refer the case to the Parole Board as soon as the prisoner has served the “requisite custodial period”, which is two-thirds of the appropriate custodial term. The Parole Board can only direct the release of the prisoner if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be confined. If the Parole Board does not direct the release of the prisoner, he must be released on licence at the expiry of the appropriate custodial term. </a></p><a name="para89">

The conditions for the imposition of such a sentence are that the offender was over 18 when the offence was committed, that he has been convicted of an offence listed in Schedule 18A to the 2003 Act (as also so inserted), and that the court does not impose a life sentence or EDS. Schedule 18A lists offences under the headings “Terrorism offences”, and “Sexual offences” (rape of a child under 13, and assault of a child under 13 by penetration). </a></p><a name="para93">

The aggregate of these two elements must not exceed the term that, at the time the offence was committed, was the maximum term permitted for the offence. It is worth noting that the “appropriate custodial term” for the SOPC provisions differs from the “appropriate custodial term” for the EDS provisions. The focus is on the overall sentence, the aggregate of the two elements, which has to be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. In contrast, an EDS comprises a custodial term commensurate with the offence <i>plus </i>a specified licence period, and can truly be described as an “extended” term. </a></p><a name="para94">

 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of section 82A is to require the sentencing judge to identify the sentence that would have been appropriate had a life sentence not been justified and to reduce that notional sentence to take account of the fact that had a determinate sentence been passed the offender would have been entitled to early release.” </p>

It contrasted the early release provisions applicable to an EDS, requiring the prisoner to serve two-thirds of the custodial term before becoming eligible for release, with the provisions for SOPC sentences (eligibility after half of the custodial term), and for life sentences excepting mandatory life sentences for murder (eligibility once the minimum term has been served which, save in exceptional circumstances, will be equivalent to half-way through the notional determinate sentence). This led to the conclusion (para 30) that, “putting mandatory life sentences to one side, save exceptionally, in every other case save for those sentenced to EDS, the custodial term to be served is one half of the nominate determinate term.” Thus, the EDS prisoner is “treated differently in relation to release on licence as compared with almost all other prisoners serving a custodial sentence” (para 34). </a></p><a name="para108">

This argument did not find favour with the Divisional Court, which considered the two prisoners to be in analogous situations. It considered it essential to have regard to “the principle of sentencing practice” that both an EDS and a life sentence “involve a period identified for punishment and deterrence and, potentially, further detention (albeit, in the case of an EDS, for a finite time) based on risk to the public” (para 44). </a><a name="para44">It continued: </a></p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Both must accept the period for punishment and then address the issue of risk; what is at issue is the question of eligibility for consideration for release not merely the mechanism whereby issues of release are decided.” </p>

 </a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para111"> </a><a name="para45">“Take the case of a crime which, applying the relevant guideline, justifies a sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment. For an offender in respect of whom there is no concern that he is a risk to the public, that will be the determinate term: as the law stands, he will serve six years and then be entitled to be released on licence (from which he can be recalled to prison for breach up to the end of the 12-year term). For another offender, deserving the same sentence but who, perhaps by reason of his mental condition, constitutes a risk to the public, the court might take the view that he requires an extended period on licence. If he was sentenced to an EDS with a custodial term of 12 years (ie the same as the first offender, their crimes being of equal gravity) with a two-year extension (for the purposes of extending supervision over him), he would only be eligible for consideration of parole after eight years. The gravity of their crimes is identical and their positions (in so far as punishment and deterrence is concerned) seem, to me at least, to be analogous. </a>” </p>

The court was not persuaded that this explanation for the difference in treatment of prisoners addressed what was, in the court’s view, “the crucial issue of the distinction between the punitive element of any sentence and that part of the sentence designed to cater for risk”. The fact that the offender had committed a serious offence did not, in the court’s view, provide any rational basis for altering the extent of the punitive element of a sentence, which was, in its view, the result of deferring eligibility for release in the case of an EDS prisoner; other prisoners would also have committed very serious offences, but be eligible at an earlier stage. As for dangerousness, that did not justify the different release provisions because “that is to confuse punishment and deterrence with risk”. This point is explained at para 49 as follows: </a></p><a name="para113">
 </a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para113"> </a><a name="para49">“Dangerousness under Part 12 of the 2003 Act [the sentencing provisions] is assessed by reference to future risk, and it is only at the point of potential release that the risk will be assessed (based, of course, on the history of the offender, progress in custody and resettlement plans). If relevant risk to the public remains, the offender will remain in prison. If not, it will be appropriate to release him. There is no rational justification for setting a later and arbitrary point for parole eligibility (at which risk is to be assessed) for EDS prisoners, as opposed to life sentence prisoners, or prisoners serving a sentence pursuant to section 244A of the 2003 Act. </a>” </p>

If he had been given a determinate sentence, Mr Stott would have been entitled to release at the half-way point in his sentence, that is after ten and a half years, and, had he been given a life sentence, he would probably also have been eligible for release after ten and a half years. So, Mr Southey suggests, in relation to eligibility for release, Mr Stott would have been in a better position had he been given a life sentence, even though life sentences are reserved for the most serious cases, for offenders who are the highest risk or have the most serious criminal records. </a></p><a name="para115">

He also invites us to recognise that people can be in an analogous position even if their situation is not identical, and to concentrate on the similarities between EDS prisoners and other prisoners. In terms of similarities, he emphasises that both EDS prisoners and indeterminate sentence prisoners depend, for their early release, on risk assessment by the Parole Board. Like the Divisional Court, he relies upon what he says is the sentencing principle that the period preceding eligibility for parole is “the punitive and deterrent element of a sentence passed”, whereas any further time spent in custody is “seen as pertaining to the risk to the public posed by the offender” (see, for example, <i>R (Foley) v Parole Board for England and Wales </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/2184.html">[2012] EWHC 2184 (Admin)</a>). In his submission, this is the same for each group of prisoners, and the Secretary of State’s argument is wrong because it ignores that sentencing principle. Furthermore, he points out that determinate sentence prisoners, EDS prisoners, and those serving an indeterminate sentence all “share the same interest, namely in being released from custody”. </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para117">117. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On justification, Mr Southey reminds us that it is the differential treatment that must be justified, not the EDS itself, and in his submission, it has not been. Considerations of relative risk cannot provide the required justification, he says. It can be assumed that the highest risk offenders, and the offenders who have committed the most serious offences, are serving a life sentence, and lower risk prisoners should not be treated less favourably in relation to early release. Risk is addressed through the Parole Board process, an EDS prisoner only being released if the Parole Board is satisfied that continued detention is not necessary for the protection of the public. There is no basis, submits Mr Southey, for concluding that the risk that an EDS prisoner poses at the half-way point in his sentence will necessarily be such as to require continued detention, and denying him the opportunity even to apply for release until two-thirds of the way through his sentence, when the prisoner serving an indeterminate term can apply at half-time. The effect of this is to impose a greater penalty without reason. Further, he says that there is no basis to distinguish between the EDS prisoner and the regular determinate sentence prisoner as both are equally culpable, and the punitive component of their sentence should be the same; differential risk is addressed by the involvement of the Parole Board in the case of the EDS prisoner. </a></p><a name="para117">

It is submitted that it is in a class by itself, designed to address a particular combination of offending and risk. Although accepting that a life sentence can be viewed as comprising a period of detention justified by punishment and deterrent followed by detention justified solely by public protection, Sir James Eadie does not accept that a similar analysis applies to a determinate sentence. His submission is that the whole of a determinate sentence (and the whole of the custodial term of an EDS) is imposed for the purpose of punishment and deterrence. </a></p><a name="para118">

Some prisoners have a right to release on licence at the half-way stage, but in some cases, the prisoner is entitled to apply for release sooner, and in some cases release requires the Parole Board’s direction. In the case of life sentences, a prisoner may not always be eligible to apply to the Parole Board at what would be the half-way point in a determinate sentence, because the minimum term of a life sentence can be fixed at more than half of the notional determinate sentence (see <i>Szczerba </i>above). Accordingly, in the Secretary of State’s submission, each type of sentence has release arrangements which have been tailored to meet the requirements of that particular sentence, justified by reference to the particular characteristics of the offenders on whom the sentence is imposed. The particular arrangements for EDS prisoners flow from the characteristics of that group of prisoners, in contrast to those serving ordinary determinate terms or indeterminate sentences. </a></p><a name="para119">

Those cases were about relevantly similar release processes being applied differently, he says, whereas the complaint here is, in contrast, about the operation of different types of sentence, and whether the factors which justify the imposition of a particular sentence also justify the particular release arrangements that form part of the administration of the sentence.

Here, the policy choices made by Parliament, with respect to the release arrangements for an EDS prisoner, are well within its discretion when striking a balance between the interests of public protection and the interests of the individual prisoner. Unlike in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, the differences in treatment are all justified by the risk that EDS prisoners pose in comparison to other prisoners, and the early release provisions achieve the legitimate aim of protecting the public. </a></p><a name="para121">

The applicant had been sentenced to a longer custodial sentence than would have been commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, because the court considered it necessary to protect the public from serious harm (section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991). He argued that his sentence consisted of a “punitive part” and a “preventive part”, and that he should have been entitled to a proper review of the lawfulness of his continued detention, with an oral hearing, as soon as he had served the period that he would have served under the normal punitive sentence. The ECtHR observed that, in contrast to indeterminate sentences, there was no question of the sentence being imposed because of factors that were susceptible to change with the passage of time, such as dangerousness or mental instability. The whole of the fixed term was “a sentence which was imposed as punishment for the offences committed”. The necessary judicial control was therefore incorporated in the original conviction and sentence. </a></p><a name="para125">

The case was concerned with an extended sentence imposed under section 210A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (as inserted by section 86 of the (inserted by Crime and Disorder Act 1998)), but there are similarities between such a sentence and an EDS. The sentence comprised a custodial term of seven years followed by an extension period of three years on licence. The prisoner was released on licence after serving two-thirds of the custodial term, but then recalled. He complained of a breach of article 5, on the basis that he had not been provided with appropriate rehabilitation courses, during the period of his recall, to enable him to achieve his release, by demonstrating to the Parole Board that he no longer posed a risk to the public. Although the court took the opportunity to modify the article 5 jurisprudence by departing from <i>R (Kaiyam) v Secretary of State for Justice </i>(above), his action failed because he had, in fact, been provided with a range of appropriate rehabilitative measures. Lord Reed gave a judgment with which the remaining members of the court were all in agreement, and, although the issue for the court was different, some passages have some relevance to the present case. </p>

The same can be said of the present case, as these objectives form part of the sentencing process in England and Wales as well, featuring in section 142(1) of the 2003 Act as “purposes of sentencing” (above). Section 142(1) is in very general terms, applying to “any court dealing with an offender in respect of his offences”, making no difference between periods of the sentence which will be spent in custody and periods which the offender can expect to spend on licence. No doubt this is unsurprising, given that the sentencing judge is not to have regard to the early release provisions when fixing the appropriate sentence. </a></p><a name="para129">

He said: </a></p><a name="para130">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Release on licence is intended to ensure that the process of transition from custody to freedom is supervised, so as to maximise the chances of the ex-prisoner’s successful reintegration into the community and minimise the chances of his relapse into criminal activity.” </p>

In the following passage from para 60, he proceeded upon the basis that the custodial term addressed the punitive aspect of the sentence, in contrast to the extension, which was for the protection of the public: </a></p><a name="para131">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt; margin-left:72.0pt">“60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … the purpose of detention during the extension period is materially different from that of a determinate sentence. In terms of section 210A(2)(b) of the 1995 Act, the extension period is ‘of such length as the court considers necessary for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1)(b)’, namely ‘protecting the public from serious harm from the offender’. … The punitive aspect of the sentence has already been dealt with by the custodial term, which is ‘the term of imprisonment … which the court would have passed on the offender otherwise than by virtue of this section’: section 210A(2)(a). Where a prisoner serving an extended sentence is detained during the extension period, other than by virtue of an order made under section 16 or another sentence, his continued detention is therefore justified solely by the need to protect the public from serious harm.” </p>

The category in relation to which this is perhaps most challenging to explain, is where release requires the Parole Board to be satisfied on the question of risk. Some prisoners, notably for present purposes, the EDS prisoner, have to serve a greater proportion of their sentence than others, before they can try to persuade the Parole Board on that issue. Whatever the correct answer to the two component debate, this differential wait for the chance to approach the Parole Board demands attention. Accordingly, there might not be much value in pursuing the two component debate further. </a></p><a name="para135">

Whilst the assertion that the requirement for an EDS prisoner to serve two-thirds of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole is out of step with comparable prisoners has an initial attraction, it is less compelling if the rest of the prisoners are not, in fact, in step with each other. The argument proceeds on the basis that other prisoners are eligible for release/parole at the half-way point in their sentence, but on closer examination, it can be seen that this is by no means universal. Standard determinate sentence prisoners <i>are </i>entitled to (automatic) release at the half-way point. Most life sentence prisoners (excepting those where a whole life term has been imposed) are eligible to apply for release once they have served their minimum term, and in most cases this minimum term will be the equivalent to half of the notional determinate term, but that is not universal even for discretionary life sentences (see <i>Szczerba </i>above), and in the case of mandatory life sentences, the period is not fixed by reference to a notional determinate term. Accordingly there are other prisoners who serve longer than half of their sentences before they have a chance of release on licence. Conversely, there are some prisoners who serve less than half. Home Detention Curfew can enable determinate sentence prisoners to achieve their release before the half-way point, and an SOPC prisoner is eligible to apply for release from the half-way point of his appropriate custodial term, and not the half-way point in his overall sentence (which will be the aggregate of the custodial term plus the licence tacked on to it). </a></p><a name="para136">

The prisoners under consideration there, all required a recommendation from the Parole Board before they could achieve early release. But for those, like Mr Clift, who were serving determinate terms of 15 years or more, the final decision on early release lay with the Secretary of State, whereas for the other prisoners the Parole Board’s recommendation was enough. The ECtHR considered the prisoners to be “relevantly similar”. The key was that, in each case, it was all about determining whether the prisoner posed too much of a risk to be released. So, at para 67, the court observed that a refusal of early release was “not intended to constitute further punishment but to reflect the assessment of those qualified to conduct it that the prisoner in question poses an unacceptable risk upon release”. As “the methods of assessing risk and the means of addressing any risk identified are in principle the same for all categories of prisoners”, it considered that there was no distinction to be drawn between the prisoners, who were in analogous positions. </a></p><a name="para140">

The claimant had been given a determinate sentence of 18 years. She was eligible for release at the half-way point in the sentence if the Parole Board recommended it, and for automatic release at the two-thirds point. The test that the Parole Board had to apply in her case was more onerous than the test that would have been applicable had she been given a life sentence. She therefore argued that there was a violation of article 14. Her claim failed because <i>R (Clift) </i>meant that she could not establish that the different treatment was on the ground of other status, but the court went on to set out what it would have decided had there not been that obstacle. Although acknowledging that there were differences between the sentences, Treacy J (with whom Thomas LJ agreed, adding a few words) accepted, at para 71, that the situation of the claimant was analogous to an indeterminate sentence prisoner, saying: </a></p><a name="para141">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Whilst it is obvious that an offender serving a determinate sentence has the benefit of having a finite limit on the reach of the law in relation to that sentence, I do not think that constitutes a material difference. Both types of sentence now in reality are divided into a punitive element which may be followed by a period of risk based detention. So, in my view, the identified differences between a determinate and an indeterminate sentence do not prevent their treatment as analogous.” </p>
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court’s conclusion was that there was no objective justification for the difference. Treacy J considered the reasoning in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>pertinent, because it was also about “the imposition of different early release requirements”. Release during Ms Foley’s sentence and during an indeterminate sentence both involved a risk assessment exercise, and consideration of risk by the same body, but significantly different tests were applied. Treacy J’s analysis proceeded upon the basis that the punitive element of a determinate sentence lasted up to the half-way point, leading him to conclude that there was no good reason why “those who ex hypothesi are to be regarded as less dangerous because they have received a determinate rather than an indeterminate sentence, should be subject to greater punishment … [or] … why both types of offender should not become eligible for release subject to questions of risk at the same point in their sentence” (see paras 69 and 76). </a></p><a name="para142">

The situation was not found to be analogous in <i>Massey </i>, and the following reasoning found at para 25 of the judgment of Moses LJ is equally applicable here, it is submitted: </p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“however he cloaks his application, the real complaint he advances is a challenge to his original sentence. … The reality of his argument is that he was sentenced under a different regime.

At the least, however, <i>Massey </i>serves as an introduction to my consideration of whether Mr Stott’s complaint is also, in fact, about the sentencing regime to which he has been consigned rather than, discretely, about the early release provisions that are part of it. </a></p><a name="para144">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me important to recognise the complexity and detail of the provisions governing the various sentences that can be imposed. It was, in part, for that reason that I set these out as fully as I did earlier. From that review of the statutory provisions concerning EDS, standard determinate sentences, SOPC, and indeterminate sentences, it can be seen that, far from there being a basic sentencing regime, with discrete variations for particular sentences, each sentence has its own detailed set of rules, dictating when it can be imposed and how it operates in practice, the early release provisions being part and parcel of the rules. Some sentences can only be imposed if there is a significant risk of the offender causing serious harm to members of the public by committing further offences, for example. Some sentences can only be imposed where the offender has already committed offences of a particular type. For some, there is automatic early release on licence, but, for others, release on licence is dependent on the Parole Board. Those serving indeterminate terms remain on licence (and liable to be recalled to prison) for the rest of their lives, whereas other offenders will be on licence for a finite period only. All of this fine detail tends to support the Secretary of State’s argument that each sentence is tailored to a particular category of offender, addressing a particular combination of offending and risk. Subject of course to sentencing guidance, the judge selects the sentence which matches the attributes of the case before him, and fixes the term of any period of imprisonment, extended licence etc. I can therefore see the force in the argument that the release provisions about which Mr Stott complains should not be looked at on their own, but as a feature of the regime under which he has been sentenced, the same regime that is sufficiently distinct to justify taking the view that his complaint is on the ground of “other status”. There might be said, therefore, to be a building case for holding that he is not in an analogous situation to others sentenced under different regimes. </a></p><a name="para145">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para145"></a><a name="para146">146. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weight is added to this when some of the detail of the EDS regime is compared specifically with other sentences. Of the determinate sentences, only an EDS requires a finding of significant risk to members of the public of serious harm. The Secretary of State points out that, in contrast to EDS prisoners, not all discretionary life sentence prisoners have been found to be dangerous, such a finding not being required for the imposition of life sentences under section 224A. That submission, whilst literally correct, is significantly weakened when one considers the nature of the listed offences which are a pre-requisite to the imposition of such a life sentence. As we have seen, Mr Southey’s submission that life sentences are “reserved for offenders who are the highest risk or have the most serious criminal records”, for “the most serious cases”, reflects the view that Treacy J took of relative dangerousness in <i>Foley </i>. </a></p><a name="para146">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146"></a><a name="para147">147. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There <i>are </i>important differences between an EDS and a discretionary life sentence, however. There are respects in which a discretionary life sentence must undoubtedly be viewed as having more serious consequences for the offender, notwithstanding that he may have an earlier opportunity to approach the Parole Board. An EDS involves imprisonment for a specified period which will necessarily come to an end, whether or not the prisoner’s release is directed by the Parole Board, but a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence may remain in detention for the rest of his life. If he is released, he remains on licence (and liable to recall) for life, whereas the EDS prisoner is on licence for a finite period only. </a></p><a name="para147">

Mr Southey proceeds upon the basis that life sentences are given to the prisoners who are the highest risk or have committed the most serious offences. Those serving a determinate sentence, including an EDS, are therefore lower risk/less serious offenders, and there cannot be any justification for treating them less favourably in relation to early release than life prisoners. Relative risk cannot justify this, he says, because neither category of prisoner will be released before the Parole Board directs it, having considered the question of risk, and both categories will be on licence upon early release. Although Mr Southey also complains that there is no basis for distinguishing between those serving an EDS and those serving a determinate term, I find the comparison less persuasive than is the comparison with indeterminate sentence prisoners, given the conditions for the imposition of an EDS, which differentiate EDS prisoners from standard determinate term prisoners. The comparison may have had more force, had the two-component punitive/risk analysis been unassailable. In that event, it could have been questioned how it was justified to require the EDS prisoner to serve a longer punishment period (as opposed to a longer period of detention dependent upon risk) than a standard determinate term prisoner. However, I have explained my reservations about the two component analysis earlier. </a></p><a name="para149">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para149"></a><a name="para150">150. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of State’s fundamental answer is that there are different categories of sentence, tailored to the particular characteristics of the offenders, and striking a balance between the interests of public protection and the interests of the individual prisoner. All EDS prisoners are dangerous, and the legitimate aim is to protect the public by ensuring that they serve a greater proportion of their custodial term than other categories of prisoner, which may include prisoners who are not dangerous. This is comprehensible when the position of an EDS prisoner is compared with a standard determinate term prisoner, in relation to whom there is no equivalent requirement to find specifically that there is a significant risk of serious harm to the public through further specified offences. It works less easily in relation to indeterminate sentences. True it is that there is not a universal requirement for a finding of dangerousness, before the imposition of an indeterminate sentence, but, as I implied earlier, it is not a great leap from the conditions that have to be satisfied before the sentence can be passed to the conclusion that by far the majority of indeterminate sentence prisoners will pose a risk to the public. Nevertheless, it is correctly pointed out on behalf of the Secretary of State that, in contrast to the release provisions in relation to an EDS, the release provisions in relation to indeterminate sentences must cater for prisoners who are not dangerous, and might be suitable for release sooner. Moreover, Sir James invites us to consider each sentence as a whole, when considering justification, because it is artificial to compare release provisions only. Of crucial importance is the fact that the indeterminate sentence prisoner may never be released at all, whereas the EDS prisoner will be released at the end of his custodial term, even if he fails to satisfy the Parole Board on the question of risk, and also the difference in the duration of the licence in each case. </a></p><a name="para150">

Ms Foulds, an official from the Ministry of Justice who describes herself as “the policy lead on adult custodial sentencing policy”, says in her witness statement of September 2016 that the government introduced a “tougher, extended determinate sentence” as a “measure designed to enhance public protection and maintain public confidence in the sentencing framework”. The ECtHR in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>was not impressed with the public confidence argument, but accepted (para 74) that more stringent early release provisions “may be justified where it can be demonstrated that those to whom they apply pose a higher risk to the public upon release”. Given that it cannot be passed unless a risk condition is satisfied, an EDS is clearly aimed at offenders of this sort. </a></p><a name="para152">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para152"> <span style="color:black"></span></a><a name="para153">153. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The questions that are more difficult are whether the longer wait before the prisoner is eligible to apply to the Parole Board is an appropriate means of achieving this aim and whether it is disproportionate in its impact. The starting point for a determination of these questions is that the ECtHR would allow a Contracting State a margin of appreciation in assessing whether, and to what extent, differences in otherwise similar situations justify different treatment, and would allow a wide margin when it comes to questions of prisoner and penal policy, although closely scrutinising the situation where the complaint is in the ambit of article 5. This court must equally respect the policy choices of parliament in relation to sentencing <span style="color:black">. </span></a></p><a name="para153">

Ultimately, I am persuaded that the proper way to look at the issue is by considering each sentence as a whole, as the Secretary of State invites us to do. The sentencing judge imposes the sentence that complies with the statutory conditions prescribed by parliament, and the sentencing guidelines, and, within that framework, best meets the characteristics of the offence and the offender. The early release provisions have to be seen as part of the chosen sentencing regime, and the question of whether there is an objective justification for the differential treatment of prisoners in relation to earlier release, considered in that wider context. </a></p><a name="para154">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para154"></a><a name="para155">155. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that I have set out above, there is a readier comparison between the EDS and an indeterminate sentence, than between a simple determinate term and an EDS. But the EDS and the indeterminate sentence are by no means a complete match, leaving aside the difference in parole eligibility. Counter-balancing the indeterminate prisoner’s earlier eligibility for parole is the lack of any guaranteed end to his incarceration, and the life licence to which he is subjected. This fundamentally undermines the argument that the difference in treatment between the two prisoners in relation to early release is disproportionate, or putting it more plainly, unfair. I would accept that, on the contrary, bearing in mind the EDS sentencing package as a whole, the early release provisions are justified as a proportionate means of achieving the government’s legitimate aim. Thus, although I would accept that Mr Stott has been treated differently on the grounds of “other status” within article 14, there being an objective justification for the difference in treatment of EDS prisoners, his claim must fail. It is not in fact necessary in those circumstances to give a definitive answer as to whether EDS prisoners can be said to be in an analogous situation to other prisoners. However, there is a significant overlap between the considerations that are relevant to Issue 2A and to Issue 2B, and having looked at those matters again in the context of Issue 2B, and considered the complete picture, with the benefit also of what Lord Hodge has to say on the subject in his judgment, I have come to the view that EDS prisoners cannot be said to be in an analogous situation to other prisoners. Most influential in this conclusion is that, as I see it, rather than focusing entirely upon the early release provisions, the various sentencing regimes have to be viewed as whole entities, each with its own particular, different, mix of ingredients, designed for a particular set of circumstances. </a></p><a name="para155">

In March 2002 the Parole Board recommended his release on parole taking account of reduced risk and the scope for addressing it by other means. Under the legislation then in force, for prisoners serving determinate sentences of more than 15 years, release in line with a Parole Board recommendation remained in the discretion of the Secretary of State; for prisoners serving shorter sentences (and for prisoners serving indeterminate sentences) release was mandatory. In October 2002 the Secretary of State rejected the recommendation of the Parole Board in Mr Clift’s case on the grounds that his release would present an unacceptable risk to the public. </span></a></p><a name="para163">

Section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided a discretionary power to release long-term prisoners before the two-thirds point of their sentence, if recommended by the Parole Board. Section 50 gave power to reduce the effective period of detention by converting the discretionary power under section 35 into a duty in relation to specified classes of prisoners. The Secretary of State exercised that power by the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998 (SI 1998/3218), which applied to prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than 15 years. For those serving sentences of 15 years or more, the order left in place the discretion to order early release between the service of half and two-thirds of the sentence. </span></a></p><a name="para164">

A defence of justification would not therefore have been sustainable. (That view was in due course adopted in terms by the ECtHR: para 77). </p>

That in turn formed the basis of the more limited approach subsequently taken by the House in <i>R (RJM) </i>. Lord Neuberger (para 46), while noting that Lord Bingham would have been “inclined to regard a life sentence as an acquired personal characteristic and a lifer as having an ‘other status’”, observed that this was “in the absence of decisions such as <i>Gerger </i>…”.

It shows that the courts both here and in Strasbourg have been struggling with difficulty over a long period to find a rational criterion for defining and limiting the scope of “status” in article 14. It is true, as she says (para 44), that in more recent cases the Strasbourg court has moved beyond simple reference to a “personal characteristic”, to more expansive phrases such as “identifiable, objective or personal characteristic”. However, the decision in <i>Minter v United Kingdom </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2017/1183.html">(2017) 65 EHRR SE6</a>, noted by her at paras 41-43, suggests a tendency to restrict the scope of the decision in <i>Clift </i>itself, at least in the context of different sentencing regimes. I note Lady Hale’s suggestion that sentencing criteria “concentrate upon the dangerousness of the offender, itself a personal characteristic”. That may be so, but I find it hard to accept that “dangerousness”, whether a personal characteristic or not, is a status deserving of special protection under article 14. </p>

I would need considerable persuasion that the authors of the Convention intended mere conviction of a criminal offence, or subjection to a particular custodial regime, to entitle the recipient to specially protected status under human rights law. More generally, it is important that article 14 is kept within its proper role within the Convention, and outside the core protected areas is not allowed to develop into a means of bypassing the carefully defined limits applicable to the individual rights. </span></a></p><a name="para179">

In particular I agree that the EDS regime must be looked at as a whole and cannot be treated as analogous to regimes which have different purposes and different characteristics. It is wrong to isolate the particular feature of the provisions for release on parole, and to compare it with other release provisions without regard to their context. In this respect the case is clearly distinguishable from <i>Clift </i>where there was a direct analogy between the sentence as applied respectively to those serving more and less than 15 years.

Consistency in sentencing policy is an important objective, but it does not impinge on the core values which article 14 is designed to protect. Short of irrationality or (in Strasbourg terms) manifest unreasonableness, the courts should not allow themselves to be drawn into detailed consideration of the lines drawn by the legislature between the treatment of different categories of offender. </a></p><a name="para181">

That article speaks of the ECHR rights being secured without discrimination “on any ground such as” and then lists specific grounds, including “or other status”. As Lady Black has shown in paras 13-35 of her judgment, there has been a difference of view between the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) as to the meaning of the phrase “other status” in article 14, which was manifested in the speeches in the House of Lords in <i>R (Clift) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/54.html">[2007] 1 AC 484</a> (“ <i>Clift (HL) </i>”) and in the judgment of the 4th Section of the ECtHR in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>(Application No <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%227205/07%22]}">7205/07</a>, 13 July 2010) (“ <i>Clift (ECtHR) </i>”). Questions are likely to arise as to the boundaries of “any other status” absent further guidance by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR and I would not seek to make any general statement as to those boundaries. But I am satisfied that Mr Stott has the requisite status for the following four reasons. </p>

Thus, in <i>Clift (HL) </i>para 48, Lord Hope of Craighead stated that “a generous meaning” should be given to the words “or other status” while recognising that “the proscribed grounds are not unlimited”. Similarly, in <i>R (RJM) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/63.html">[2009] AC 311</a> (“ <i>RJM </i>”), Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury at para 42 spoke of “a liberal approach” to the grounds on which discrimination was prohibited. In <i>Clift (ECtHR) </i>, paras 55 and 56, the ECtHR spoke of the listed examples of status as being “illustrative and not exhaustive” and suggested that a wide meaning be given to the words “other status”. In <i>Biao v Denmark </i>(2016) 64 EHRR 1, the ECtHR again spoke of giving those words “a wide meaning” and in <i>Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v Russia </i>(Application Nos <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%2260367/08%22]}">60367/08</a> and 961/11) the Grand Chamber repeated that view at para 61. It appears, as Lord Neuberger stated in <i>RJM </i>(para 39) that the ECtHR interprets article 14 on a “holistic or broad-brush basis”. Thirdly, the Supreme Court in <i>Mathieson v Secretary of State for Health </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/47.html">[2015] UKSC 47</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/47.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3250</a>, para 22, has accepted the judgment in <i>Clift (ECtHR) </i>. While, like Lord Carnwath, I would welcome further guidance from the Grand Chamber, I am persuaded that the weight of authority currently supports the view that Mr Stott has the required status under article 14 because he has been sentenced to a particular sentence of imprisonment, namely an EDS. </p>

I agree with her analysis in paras 123-134 of her judgment that a determinate sentence cannot be divided into a part relating to punishment and deterrence on the one hand and the avoidance of risk on the other. The idea that the punitive and deterrent part of a determinate sentence ends at the point of entitlement to, or at least eligibility for consideration for, early release is central to Mr Southey’s case and the reasoning of the Divisional Court.

In <i>R v Round </i>[2010] 2 Crim App R(S) 45, para 44, Hughes LJ described this requirement to disregard early release in fixing a sentence of imprisonment was “a matter of principle of some importance”. The Court of Appeal in <i>R v Burinskas </i> <i>(Attorney General’s Reference (No 27 of 2013)) (Practice Note) </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2014/334.html">[2014] 1 WLR 4209</a>, paras 38-39 endorsed his statement. This disregard is unsurprising as the purposes of the early release regimes include matters such as economy and the relief of over-crowding in prisons, as well as the public interest in re-integrating a prisoner into society with the benefit of supervision. As a result, each of the four purposes of imprisonment in section 142(1) of the 2003 Act may be relevant justifications of the prisoner’s continued detention throughout the custodial sentence which the judge has imposed. It follows that a determinate sentence of imprisonment is not to be divided by reference to its relevant early release provisions into a period for punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation on the one hand and a period when the only purpose is the protection of the public. There is no “punitive part” and “preventive part” in a determinate sentence of imprisonment. As Lady Black has shown (paras 124-125 of her judgment), judgments of the ECtHR, which address the requirement allowing the detained person access to judicial determination of the lawfulness of his detention in article 5(4) of the ECHR, have repeatedly recognised this characteristic of the determinate sentence. I therefore find myself in respectful disagreement with the Divisional Court in <i>R (Foley) v Parole Board for England and Wales </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/2184.html">[2012] EWHC 2184 (Admin)</a> in so far as it reasoned (para 68-69) that the reality was that the punitive element of a determinate sentence ended at the half way point.

The Divisional Court appears to have accepted this submission in paras 44-45 and 48 of its judgment.

In Lord Reed’s judgment, with which the other Justices agreed, punishment and deterrence were relevant purposes throughout the custodial term (paras 49 and 60). The provisions for early release and the period on licence (if any) before the expiry of the custodial term serve the purpose of assisting a prisoner to resume his life in the community with the assistance of supervision (para 50). The early release provisions when applied to a determinate sentence in English law or to an EDS serve a similar purpose. The period on licence after the expiry of the custodial term of an extended sentence, on the other hand, is to protect the public from serious harm (paras 53 and 60). </p>

Lady Black has discussed this in paras 136 and 145 of her judgment. As she states, there are prisoners serving discretionary life sentences who are not eligible to apply for release because their minimum term imposed under section 82A of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”) exceeds one half of the notional determinate term ( <i>R v Szczerba </i>[2002] 2 Cr App R(S) 86). Further, the minimum term for prisoners on mandatory life sentences is not fixed by reference to early release provisions applicable to a notional determinate term (section 269 of and Schedule 21 to the 2003 Act). On the other hand, SOPC prisoners under section 236A of the 2003 Act are eligible to apply for release once they have served one half of the appropriate custodial term, which is less than their overall sentence, and the overall sentence is the sentence that is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence (section 236A(3)). Other prisoners on determinate sentences can achieve release before they have served one half of their sentence at the discretion of the Secretary of State by being placed on a curfew at a specified location (sections 246 and 250(5)). </span></a></p><a name="para192">

It is appropriate to take a holistic approach to each sentencing regime in deciding whether or not one regime is analogous to another. Not all prisoners serving a discretionary life sentence will be more dangerous than a prisoner serving an EDS. There are prisoners who are serving a life sentence under section 224A of the 2003 Act, which does not require a finding that the offender was dangerous, although it is likely that in most cases he will be: <i>Burinskas </i>at para 8. A prisoner serving an EDS is not eligible for release at the direction of the Parole Board at one half of his custodial term while a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence is generally so eligible when the court exercises its discretion under section 82A of the 2000 Act. But that is far from the whole picture. As the Court of Appeal recognised in <i>Burinskas </i>(para 36), a life prisoner might have to wait for many years after his minimum term has expired before the Parole Board consider it safe to release him. By contrast, a prisoner serving an EDS is entitled to be released at the end of the custodial period without any further assessment of risk (section 246A(7)). Similarly, a person who has been given a life sentence remains on licence and subject to recall to prison for the rest of his life. By contrast, the licence provisions imposed on a person serving an EDS end on the expiry of the specified extension period (section 226A(5) and (8)). </span></a></p><a name="para193">

In <i>R (Massey) v Secretary of State for Justice </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/1950.html">[2013] EWHC 1950 (Admin)</a> a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (“an IPP”) complained that he had been discriminated against compared with a prisoner who was sentenced to an EDS after the new sentences introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 because he was subject to an indeterminate period of imprisonment while the EDS prisoner was not. Moses LJ rejected this claim, stating (at para 25) that the claimant and the EDS prisoner were “not in an analogous situation precisely because they were sentenced under a different regime.” In <i>R (Bristow) v Secretary of State for Justice </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/3094.html">[2013] EWHC 3094 (Admin)</a> the Divisional Court held that a claimant was not in an analogous situation to prisoners under a previous legislative regime and (para 16) that prisoners who were subject to discretionary release were not in an analogous situation to prisoners under an automatic release scheme. In <i>Minter v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2017/1183.html">(2017) 65 EHRR SE 6</a> in which an applicant complained of being subjected to an indefinite notification requirement, the ECtHR held that there was no discrimination as the applicant had been subjected to a different sentencing regime which was the consequence of new legislation (para 68). There is some force in Mr Southey’s response that the cases were concerned with changes in sentencing policy which were effected by legislation. This weakens their utility to Sir James Eadie to some extent. But the cases, and <i>R (Massey) </i>in particular, provide some support for his submission that one should have regard to the characteristics of each regime as a whole and not just to its provisions for early release when judging whether a claimant is in an analogous situation to someone sentenced under a different regime. </p>

This is, first, because there is no split between the punitive/deterrent part and the risk-related part of a custodial term in a determinate sentence (including an EDS) at the point at which a prisoner becomes eligible for early release. This contrasts with the position of prisoners serving discretionary life sentences. The supposed existence of this split played a fundamental part in Mr Southey’s argument and appears to have influenced the judgment of the Divisional Court, giving rise to a focus only on whether a prisoner remained dangerous after a spell in prison. It is, secondly, because there is no principle that a prisoner is entitled to be released or is eligible at the discretion of the Parole Board to be released once he has served one half of his custodial term. The position is, as I have stated, more complex. Thirdly, it is because a prisoner sentenced to an EDS is sentenced under a statutory regime which, when viewed in the round, has materially different characteristics from other determinate sentences and from life sentences, both discretionary and mandatory. In my view, the obvious and relevant differences between the sentencing regimes are sufficient to prevent prisoners serving sentences under these different sentencing regimes from being in an analogous situation. </span></a></p><a name="para195">

In repealing the provisions which established the IPP and in creating a particular regime for the imprisonment of persons convicted of serious offences and who are also dangerous Parliament is entitled to have regard both to public protection and to the maintenance of public confidence in criminal sentencing. The preservation of public confidence is a legitimate aim, at least in the context in which the custodial term which is appropriate for the offence has not expired: <i>Clift (ECtHR) </i>para 74. </span></a></p><a name="para199">

In my view one must look at the early release provisions in the context of the individual sentencing regimes which may have positive and negative features as far as the prisoner is concerned. The EDS prisoner, convicted of a serious offence and who is dangerous at the time of sentencing, has a longer wait before he is eligible for consideration for parole than many other offenders who are subject to different regimes of imprisonment, but he also has the benefit of a defined custodial term and a defined period during which he is subject to licence thereafter, in contrast to prisoners who have received life sentences. Those are the components of the particular sentencing regime which cannot be described as arbitrary. Sir James Eadie in his submissions has not provided any separate justification for the requirement of an EDS that the prisoner serve two-thirds of his sentence before he is eligible to be considered for parole rather than some other proportion, beyond saying that the offender has committed a serious offence and is dangerous at the time of sentencing. But, in my view, he does not require to do so because the EDS is a separate sentencing regime which is neither arbitrary nor unlawful. </span></a></p><a name="para200">

That is clearly not the situation in Mr Stott’s case. It will not be the situation in many cases and it is not a sufficient basis for calling into question the justification for the early release provisions of the EDS generally. Article 14 of the ECHR does not in my view provide an answer to this problem; not every anomaly in sentencing is a breach of ECHR rights.

It has enabled me to stand back and look at the basics. The claim is that the early release provisions relating to prisoners serving an extended determinate sentence (EDS) unjustifiably discriminate against such prisoners in the enjoyment of their right to liberty, contrary to article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights read with article 5. The basic fact about any sentence of imprisonment is that it takes away the prisoner’s liberty: that is the right protected by article 5. The first thing that the prisoner (and indeed anyone else) wants to know is “how long for”? So let us take three prisoners who have committed the same, very serious, offence: one receives an ordinary determinate sentence of, say, 21 years; another qualifies for an EDS and receives an EDS of, say 21 years, with an extended licence period of four years on top of that; and another qualifies for and receives a discretionary life sentence, with a minimum custodial period of ten and a half years. The first prisoner will automatically be released on licence after ten and a half years; the second prisoner will only be considered for release on licence after 14 years; the third prisoner will be considered for release on licence after ten and half years. Is this most basic disparity in the treatment of these three prisoners compatible with the convention rights of the less favourably treated one? </a></p><a name="para205">

 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.” </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1">The equally authentic French text reads: </p>
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“La jouissance des droits et libertés reconnus dans la présente Convention doit être assurée, sans distinction aucune, fondée notamment sur le sexe, la race, la couleur, la langue, la religion, les opinions politiques ou toutes autres opinions, l’origine nationale ou sociale, l’appartenance à une minorité nationale, la fortune, la naissance ou toute autre situation.” </p>
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para206">Thus, for the English “without discrimination”, the French reads “sans distinction aucune”, but the European Court of Human Rights has said that outlawing any distinction could lead to absurd results, and the French text should be read in the light of the more restrictive text of the English version ( <i>Belgian Linguistic case (No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1968/3.html">(1968) 1 EHRR 252</a>, para 10). On the other hand, for “other status”, the French reads “toute autre situation”, which has led the court to take an expansive view of what counts as an “other status” (see <i>Carson v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/338.html">(2010) 51 EHRR 13</a>, para 70). </p>

Unlike article 1 of the 12th Protocol to the Convention (to which the United Kingdom is not a party), it does not prohibit discrimination in the enjoyment of “any right set forth by law” but only in the enjoyment of the Convention rights. But of course there does not have to be a breach of one of those rights - otherwise the article would add nothing. The rights have to be enjoyed equally. So the facts have to fall within the ambit of one of the rights or relate to one of the ways in which one of the rights is secured within the member state. In this case it is common ground that a sentence of imprisonment falls within the ambit of article 5, which regulates the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his liberty. Equally it is common ground that there is no breach of article 5, because article 5(1)(a) permits “the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court”. </a></p><a name="para208">

It is clearly intended to add something to the requirement of discrimination or a difference in treatment: otherwise article 14 would simple have said that “the enjoyment of the Convention rights shall be secured without (unjustified) discrimination (between persons in an analogous situation)”. “Status” has usually been said to refer to a “personal characteristic” of the person concerned (beginning with <i>Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v Denmark </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1976/6.html">(1976) 1 EHRR 711</a>, but see also, for example, <i>Maktouf and Damjanovic v Bosnia and Herzegovina </i>(2013) 58 EHRR 11, para 83, and <i>Magee v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 31 EHRR 35, para 50, where differences in treatment between different courts or different parts of the United Kingdom were held not to be contrary to article 14 as they were not based upon personal characteristics). But it is not limited to innate qualities such as sex, race, colour, birth status or sexual orientation. It includes acquired qualities such as religion, political opinion, marital or nonmarital status, or habitual residence. But in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>(Application No <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22appno%22:[%227205/07%22]}">7205/07</a>, judgment of 13 July 2010, inexplicably only reported in The Times, 21 July 2010), the court pointed out that not all the listed qualities are a personal characteristic, giving property as an example. Not only that, the court has not given an <i>ejusdem generis </i>interpretation to “other status” and has adopted a very broad approach: applying article 14, for example, to different categories of property owners ( <i>James v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 123</a>, para 74), large and small landowners ( <i>Chassagnou v France </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1999/22.html">(1999) 29 EHRR 615</a>, para 95), and non-commissioned officers and ordinary soldiers ( <i>Engle v The Netherlands (No 1) </i>(1969) 1 EHRR 647). </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para210">210. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, the court also declared itself “not persuaded that the Government’s argument that the treatment of which the applicant complains must exist independently of the ‘other status’ upon which it is based finds any clear support in its case law” (para 60). <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i> <i>v Slovakia </i>(2006) 46 EHRR 10 was cited as an illustration: a man who had been adjudged father of a child in legal proceedings complained that there was no way of correcting the record when DNA tests proved that he was not the father, whereas fathers whose paternity had been established on other grounds, and mothers, did have such a possibility ( <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i>, para 48). With respect, this is not a good illustration, for two reasons. First, the applicability of article 14 was not disputed and so there is no discussion of “other status” in the judgment. Second, and more important, while it may well be the case that there was no other difference in treatment between the applicant and the others with whom he compared himself, his status, as a man who had been adjudged father in legal proceedings, was obviously different from the status of those fathers who had not, and even more different from the status of mothers. In other words, his status was not <i>defined by </i>the difference in treatment complained of. That, it seems to me is the true principle: the “status” must not be defined solely by the difference in treatment complained of, for otherwise the words “on any ground such as …” would add nothing to the article. </a></p><a name="para210">

In <i>Fornah v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/46.html">[2006] UKHL 46</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/46.html">[2007] 1 AC 412</a>, the House of Lords affirmed the principle (also endorsed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) that a “particular social group” must exist independently of the persecution to which the group is subject: by this was meant that the group was not defined solely by the persecution it feared. </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para212">212. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I have no difficulty in accepting that “The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a personal or identifiable characteristic in any given case is a matter to be assessed taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective” ( <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>, <i> </i>para 60) <i>. </i>Prisoners subject to an EDS can be identified as a distinct group, just as prisoners subject to an ordinary determinate sentence and prisoners subject to a life sentence, can be identified as a distinct group. They are defined by much more than the particular early release regime to which they are subjected. Indeed, the argument that this particular type of sentence is a distinct “package”, so persuasively put forward on behalf of the Secretary of State as a justification for the difference, confirms that fact. This is much clearer than the difference in <i>Clift </i>, which was simply between different lengths of determinate sentence. If further support for that conclusion were required, it could lie in the different criteria for the imposition of each type of sentence, which concentrate upon the dangerousness of the offender, itself a personal characteristic. </a></p><a name="para212">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para212"></a><a name="para213">213. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions (3) and (4) are logically distinct but are often discussed together in the cases. As Lord Nicholls put it in <i>R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/17.html">[2005] UKHL 17</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/37.html">[2006] 1 AC 173</a>, para 3: </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.85pt;margin-bottom: 26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“… the essential question for the court is whether the alleged discrimination, that is, the difference in treatment of which complaint is made, can withstand scrutiny. Sometimes the answer to this question will be plain. There may be such an obvious, relevant difference between the claimant and those with whom he seeks to compare himself that their situations cannot be regarded as analogous. Sometimes, where the position is not so clear, a different approach is called for. Then the court’s scrutiny may best be directed at considering whether the differentiation has a legitimate aim and whether the means chosen to achieve the aim is appropriate and not disproportionate in its adverse impact.” </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para214">214. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no such “obvious, relevant difference” here. The three groups in question are all prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment. From their point of view, the most important question in their lives is “when will I get out?” Allied to that may be two subsidiary questions, “who will decide when I get out - will it be automatic or will I have to go before the Parole Board?” and “if I am let out, what will be the consequences of that?” Each group of prisoners under discussion here is subject to a different package of answers to those questions. But we must beware of treating the “package” which means that each of these groups has a different status as meaning that their situations are not analogous for the purpose of needing a justification for the difference in their treatment. To take an obvious example, women have a different status from men for the purpose of article 14. But the obvious physical differences between men and women do not mean that their situations are not relevantly similar, for the purpose, for example, of their right to liberty or to respect for their family lives. We have to look to the essence of the right in question to ask whether men and women prisoners are in a relevantly similar situation. The essence of the right in question here is liberty. It would obviously be discriminatory to make one sex serve longer sentences for the same crime simply because of their gender (as opposed to other factors which might justify a difference in treatment). </a></p><a name="para214">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para214"></a><a name="para215">215. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real question in this case has always been whether the difference in treatment can be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The background is important here. The EDS was introduced in its current form when the indefinite sentence for public protection (IPP) was abolished. It was considered necessary to replace IPP with a sentence, reserved for those who posed a particular risk to the public, which was demonstrably tougher than an ordinary determinate sentence. As Alison Foulds, policy lead on adult custodial sentencing policy in the Ministry of Justice, explained in her witness statement: </a></p><a name="para215">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This was a measure designed to enhance public protection and maintain public confidence in the sentencing framework. Offenders eligible for an EDS have committed serious offences and been found to be dangerous, and would previously have been eligible for an indefinite sentence, an IPP, but not necessarily a life sentence. The longer period to be served in prison under the EDS is justified on these grounds, and distinguishes the sentence from a standard determinate sentence, and a special determinate sentence for offenders of particular concern, which provide for automatic release at the half way point, or discretionary release from the half way point, as appropriate.” </p>
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para215"></a><a name="para216">216. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Protecting the public is undoubtedly a legitimate aim. Furthermore, the criteria for imposing an EDS include that there is “a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences” (Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 226A(1)(b)). The public will be better protected if he is required to serve more of his sentence in prison and can only be released during the rest of his custodial term if the Parole Board determines that this will be safe. The criterion for imposing the sentence would therefore appear to justify the difference in treatment between an EDS prisoner and a prisoner serving a standard determinate term, even though their actual offences may be commensurate. </a></p><a name="para216">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para216"></a><a name="para217">217. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same could be said of offenders serving a special custodial sentence for “certain offenders of particular concern” (Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 236A). Here the criterion is not the dangerousness of the particular offender, but the dangerousness of the offence which he has committed: if he is convicted of an offence listed in Schedule 18A, and the court does not impose a life sentence or an EDS, the court must impose a special sentence which consists of the “appropriate custodial term” plus an extra year for which he is subject to a licence (section 236A(1), (2)). These prisoners may be let out at half time, but only if the Parole Board decides that this will be safe. These prisoners have not been held to be dangerous in themselves in the same way that prisoners sentenced to an EDS have been held to be dangerous. Nevertheless, this comparison is getting closer to the bone, given the intrinsically dangerous nature of the offences listed in Schedule 18A (most of which have a terrorist connection). </a></p><a name="para217">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para217"></a><a name="para218">218. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The comparison with a discretionary life sentence is more difficult to understand. It is well-established that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the specified period which the prisoner must serve before he can be considered for release on licence should be fixed at half of the notional determinate sentence which he would have received for the offence had he not been subject to a life sentence because of his dangerousness: see <i>R v Szczerba </i>[2002] 2 Cr App R(S) 86. Given that a discretionary life sentence prisoner is even more dangerous than an EDS prisoner, how can it be justified that the former can be considered for release on licence after serving half of what would have been an appropriate determinate sentence, whereas the latter must wait until he has served two thirds of the appropriate determinate sentence? The public’s need for protection is likely to be greater in the case of the “lifer” than in the case of the EDS prisoner. But in any event, neither can be released on licence until the Parole Board has determined that it will be safe to do so. The public is equally well protected in each case. </a></p><a name="para218">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para218"></a><a name="para219">219. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is, of course, the case that there are ways in which the EDS prisoner is better off than the “lifer”. He must be released on licence at the end of his appropriate custodial term, even if the Parole Board has not determined that this would be safe, whereas the “lifer” must only be released if this is adjudged safe. Once released on licence, he can only be returned to prison during the period of his extended sentence, whereas the “lifer” will remain on licence, and thus subject to return to prison, for the whole of his natural life. This is the essence of the “package” element which was pressed on us as a justification for the difference in their early release regimes. The package should not be “salami sliced” into its component parts for the purpose of deciding whether each difference in treatment can be justified. </a></p><a name="para219">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para219"></a><a name="para220">220. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, however, it is easy to see how the additional disadvantages (from the prisoner’s point of view) of a discretionary life sentence are justified by the considerations which led the court to impose the sentence in the first place. It is hard to see how, alone of all four types of prisoner considered here, it is thought necessary to insist that an EDS prisoner stays in prison for more than half the custodial term appropriate to the seriousness of his offending. One would have thought that, if anything, a discretionary life prisoner would be even less likely to be fit for release at the half way point. But the speed of rehabilitation is notoriously difficult to predict at the outset. That is why the decision is left to the Parole Board when the time comes to consider release. And the protection which the Parole Board offers to the public is the reason why it is not necessary, for that purpose, to insist that EDS prisoners spend a larger proportion of the appropriate term in prison. </a></p><a name="para220">

Further, under the special custodial sentence regime introduced by Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 as amended by section 236A of the 2003 Act, whereby a court could impose the appropriate custodial sentence plus a further period on licence of one year, a prisoner was entitled to have his suitability for release on licence considered by the Parole Board after serving half such sentence. The special custodial regime was available for inter alia an offender who had raped a child under 13, which it happens was also offending for which Mr Stott was sentenced. </a></p><a name="para226">

In the case of a mandatory life sentence, the minimum custodial sentence must take account of various factors, none expressly linked with any notional determinate term. In the case of a discretionary life sentence, the court must, under section 82A of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, identify what sentence would have been appropriate had a determinate sentence been imposed and take account of the fact that the offender would then have been entitled to early release: see Lady Black, para 103.

I agree with Lady Black that he can. I accept that the requirement of an “other status” cannot simply be ignored, or subsumed in the question whether any discrimination is unjustified. This is for at least three reasons. First, the language of article 14 states that there must be discrimination on a ground “such as” those specified, the last being “other status”. There would be no point in this language, if the only question was whether there was discrimination. </a></p><a name="para228">

While it may be odd to speak of a criterion for the application of article 14 as an exception, the general idea is clear enough: (a) the concept of “status” should be construed broadly, but (b) not every difference in treatment is on the ground of status. </p>

It was a difference based on the differing gravity of the offence, rather than on any status. For the same reason, a mere difference in the sentence imposed cannot of itself amount to a difference in status. This also explains the difference in treatment by Lord Hughes of the two arguments raised in favour of the existence of a status in <i>R v Docherty (Shaun) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/62.html">[2016] UKSC 62</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/62.html">[2017] 1 WLR 181</a>, para 63. As to the second argument, the mere imposition of an indeterminate sentence under the appropriate sentencing regime could not give the offender a different status. As to the first, however, Lord Hughes left open the possibility that the offender had a different status because he had been convicted prior to 3 December 2012, when the appropriate sentencing regime provided for an indeterminate sentence, rather than after 3 December 2012, when indeterminate sentences for public protection were abolished. He held instead that any discrimination on the ground of status was justified. </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para231">231. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That a mere difference in treatment does not by itself constitute a difference in status is a proposition which is difficult to fault in the light of <i>Gerger </i>and what I have already said. But problems have arisen from attempts to extend the application of such a proposition to cases beyond its scope. This is, I think, the root of the third difficulty expressed by Lady Black in the first sentence of para 74 of her judgment. There is no reason why a person may not be identified as having a particular status when the or an aim is to discriminate against him in some respect on the ground of that status. Thus, in <i>Clift </i>the categorisation of Mr Clift as a prisoner serving a sentence of more than 15 years’ imprisonment (a bright-line distinction clearly associated in the legislature’s mind with a significantly higher level of risk) was with a view to the discriminatory treatment about which Mr Clift complained, since it meant that he would receive less favourable treatment (a) as regards early release, than life prisoners presenting on their face an even greater risk, and also (b) as regards prisoners serving sentences of less than 15 years, since his release would be subject to approval by the Secretary of State who could contribute nothing relevant to any evaluation of continuing risk. It is to my mind unsurprising that such categorisation was in these circumstances regarded as giving Mr Clift a relevant status. It was common ground in <i>Clift </i>that being a prisoner was a status, and it was a short step from that in the circumstances to accepting that being a particular type of prisoner, namely one serving a determinate sentence of 15 years of more and viewed accordingly as presenting a particular risk (which was however addressed in a discriminatory fashion), could also be identified as a status. </a></p><a name="para231">

He had the status of a father whose paternity had been established by judicial determination, in contrast with the different status of a parent whose paternity was legally presumed without judicial determination. The discrimination between these two statuses was that in the latter case paternity could subsequently be disproved by a DNA test, whereas in the former case no such procedure existed under domestic law. </a></p><a name="para232">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para232"></a><a name="para233">233. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ECtHR in para 60 of its judgment in <i>Clift </i>rejected “the Government’s argument that the treatment of which the applicant complains must exist independently of the ‘other status’ upon which it is based”. It reasoned that in <i>Paul </i> <i>í </i> <i>k </i>“there was no suggestion that the distinction relied upon had any relevance outside the applicant’s complaint”. One might question if that could really have been so: it seems, self-evidently, one thing to have to prove paternity in court and thereafter, whenever the need arose, to have to identify a valid and enforceable court decision establishing paternity, and another matter to be able simply to rely on a factual presumption. Leaving that thought on one side, however, <i>Clift </i>suggests that a difference in the basis of established paternity represented a sufficient difference in status, even though the only continuing effect of the distinction consisted in the discriminatory possibility in the one case and impossibility in the other of subsequent disproof of paternity by a DNA test. </a></p><a name="para233">

That would surely be discrimination on an illegitimate ground within the language of article 14.

Article 14 is not targeted at achieving complete equality of treatment. A firm which haphazardly treated different customers with different standards of attention because its different employees were not consistently trained to perform to the same standards could not be said to be discriminating on the ground of any status possessed by any of its customers. A person who refused to serve a customer within ordinary hours (or to stay open late out of hours, when normally he would have been prepared to do so) because he had a headache could not be said to be discriminating on the ground of any status possessed by the or any customer. There would be no question of him having to justify his conduct by reference to the severity of his headache. </a></p><a name="para235">

He is subject to an EDS, which is a sentence distinct from and has characteristics differing from those of any ordinary determinate or indeterminate sentence. The difference of treatment about which he complains consists in one consequence of his being given an EDS, namely that he was and is subject to a different regime as regards eligibility for consideration for parole. </a></p><a name="para236">

It follows from what I have already said that, in my opinion, the Supreme Court should now depart from that decision, and follow the clear guidance given by the ECtHR in <i>Clift v United Kingdom </i>. I should add that, in reaching this conclusion, I have benefitted substantially from Lady Black’s comprehensive analysis of the authorities on status. Save to the limited extent that appears from what I have said above, I have no comment on and see no reason to disagree with that analysis. </p>
 <p class="ParaHeading">Analogous position and justification </p>
 <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para238">238. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decisive questions are therefore whether an offender like Mr Stott serving an EDS is in an analogous position to an offender serving a determinate or indeterminate sentence, and, if so, whether the difference in treatment of an EDS offender as regards parole is objectively justified.

On this basis, the question is whether the differences in their treatment as regards release on licence are justified. Like Lady Black, I do not consider that this question is avoided by the argument, advanced by the Secretary of State, that the whole of all such sentences should be seen as imposed as punishment for the offences committed, rather than as having two components, a punitive part followed by a preventive part. However such sentences may in other contexts be analysed, it remains the case that the differences between them regarding early release have significant advantages or disadvantages for the relevant prisoners, which once identified call for examination and justification. </span></a></p><a name="para239">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para239"></a><a name="para240">240. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as regards justification, the ECtHR accepted in <i>Clift </i>that more stringent early release provisions could be justified where a particular group of prisoners could be demonstrated to pose a higher risk to the public upon release: para 74. On that basis, it accepted in principle that the application of more stringent early release provisions might “have to be dependent on a bright-line cut-off point” and considered “that such a bright-line distinction will not of itself fall foul of the Convention”; accordingly, the fact that different early release provisions applied to those serving determinate sentences of 15 years or more, compared to those serving less than 15 years, did not of itself suggest unlawful discrimination: para 76. </a></p><a name="para240">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para240"></a><a name="para241">241. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason the ECtHR regarded the difference in <i>Clift </i>between treatment of, on the one hand, prisoners serving more than 15 years’ imprisonment and, on the other hand, prisoners serving less than 15 years’ imprisonment or serving indeterminate sentences as unjustifiable was the requirement for the Secretary of State to consent to implementation of any Parole Board recommendation for release in the case of the former: paras 77 to 78. The ECtHR said in this connection that: </a></p><a name="para241">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The differential treatment of prisoners serving 15 years or more, whose release continued to be dependent on the decision of the Secretary of State, had become an indefensible anomaly, as the assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task which was at the relevant time recognised to have no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not, and did not claim to, bring any superior expertise …” </p>
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para241"></a><a name="para242">242. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ECtHR also held the difference in treatment in <i>Clift </i>between prisoners serving in excess of 15 years’ imprisonment and life prisoners to be unjustified for a further reason. Life prisoners apparently presented a greater risk than a prisoner on whom a determinate sentence had been passed. Yet there was in their case no requirement that the Secretary of State consent to their release. Once release was recommended by the Parole Board, it was the Secretary of State’s duty to direct their release on licence. </a></p><a name="para242">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para242"></a><a name="para243">243. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the same token, in the present case, a more stringent release regime for prisoners sentenced to an EDS could be regarded as justified, when compared with that applicable to prisoners sentenced to an ordinary determinate sentence. Any ordinary determinate sentence and the “appropriate” custodial term to be served under an EDS fall to be determined on the principle set out in section 153(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, that they: </a></p><a name="para243">
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“must be for the shortest term (not exceeding the permitted maximum) that in the opinion of the court is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it.” </p>
 <p class="ParaNoNumber">One pre-condition to the imposition of an EDS is, however, that “the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences”: section 226A(1)(b) of the 2003 Act. Another (at the relevant time) was that the court was “not required by section 224A or 225(2) to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life”: section 226A(1)(c). </p>
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para243"></a><a name="para244">244. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying similar reasoning to that of the ECtHR in <i>Clift </i>, Parliament could be taken to have considered that this risk was in the case of an EDS prisoner sufficiently significant (a) to require release on licence during the currency of the appropriate custodial term to depend on a Parole Board recommendation, (b) to require two-thirds of such term to have run, before the Parole Board considered whether to make such a recommendation and (c) to require an extended period on licence after expiry of the appropriate custodial term. In contrast, release on licence is, in the case of an ordinary determinate prisoner, automatic once he has served the “requisite custodial period” consisting of half their nominal sentence: section 244. The Administrative Court in Sir Brian Leveson, President of the Queen’s Bench Division’s full and helpful judgment, was not persuaded that there was any justification for a distinction which necessarily assumes that EDS prisoners remain as a class a significant risk until the two-thirds point, depriving them of even the chance of demonstrating their safety for release on licence until that point, whereas all ordinary determinate prisoners are assumed to be safe for automatic release at the half way stage. I see the force of the Administrative Court’s view, but in the light of the ECtHR’s approach in <i>Clift </i>and my conclusions regarding the comparison with indeterminate prisoners in the ensuing paragraphs, I do not base my judgment on it. </a></p><a name="para244">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para244"></a><a name="para245">245. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is, on any view, even more difficult to understand the logic of an apparently more stringent regime for EDS prisoners, when compared with discretionary life prisoners, in circumstances where the offending was, by definition, not of such a seriousness as to attract a life sentence. The tariff period for a discretionary life prisoner is, barring exceptional circumstances, set at half the notional determinate period. Once that tariff period has expired, the life prisoner has a right to require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board, and to be released on licence if the Parole Board is satisfied that such release is, in short, safe: Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, section 28(5). </a></p><a name="para245">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para245"></a><a name="para246">246. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A prisoner serving an EDS, therefore, is likely to be in a significantly worse position, as regards consideration by the Parole Board and release on licence, than a discretionary life prisoner, although the latter is likely to have committed a more serious, or no less serious, offence. It is true that in other respects a life prisoner is treated more severely: if the Parole Board is not satisfied as to the safety of his release, he may remain in prison indefinitely and, if he is released, he remains on licence and may be recalled throughout his life. But this is inherent in the nature of a discretionary life sentence, and, if anything, suggests that one would expect a more, rather than less, severe regime of review for release on licence to apply to life prisoners. It is also the case that some life prisoners may be less dangerous and safer at an earlier stage for release than some prisoners serving an EDS. But that is not the general position. None of these factors explains why life prisoners are in the great generality of cases likely to be eligible for consideration of their safety for release on licence by the Parole Board at a considerably earlier point than prisoners serving an EDS can hope for. Eligibility for consideration for release is merely the gateway to consideration by the Parole Board of safety for release on licence. It does not prejudge that question. No real explanation or justification has been given for a difference in treatment, which has important practical consequences for the prisoners affected and must seem a palpable anomaly. </a></p><a name="para246">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para246"></a><a name="para247">247. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The position regarding mandatory life prisoners is less easy to compare with that of prisoners serving an EDS. As Lady Black explains in para 102, the sentencing judge determines, in the light of the seriousness of the offence and other circumstances, a minimum custodial period after the expiry of which the prisoner has a right to require the Secretary of State to refer him to the Parole Board and a right to be released on licence if the Parole Board so recommends. But there appears to be no general or normal rule as to the length of this period, as there is in the case of discretionary life sentences: see <i>R v Szczerba </i>, cited above. </a></p><a name="para247">
 </a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para247"></a><a name="para248">248. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the event, I conclude that prisoners serving an EDS are in a significantly worse position as regards eligibility for consideration by the Parole Board and release on licence, when compared with discretionary life prisoners, that no convincing explanation or justification for this difference has been shown and that section 246A(8)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is for this reason incompatible with article 14 read with article 5 of the ECHR, in so far as it requires two-thirds of the relevant custodial period to have expired before any such eligibility arises. Since preparing this judgment on the issues of analogous situation and justification, I have also had the advantage of reading what Lady Hale says in her paras 213 to 222, with which I find myself in agreement on these issues. It follows that, in my opinion, the appeal succeeds, and Mr Stott is entitled to succeed to a corresponding declaration of incompatibility. </a></p><a name="para248"> </a></div><a name="para248">
