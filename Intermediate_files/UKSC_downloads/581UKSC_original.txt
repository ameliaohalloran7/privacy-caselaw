<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 2003 and 2008, John Worboys, the driver of a black cab in
London, committed a legion of sexual offences on women. The first respondent in
these proceedings (who has been referred to throughout as DSD) was among his
first victims. She was attacked in 2003. The second respondent (NBV) became
Worboys’ victim in July 2007. Many others were attacked by him between 2003 and
2007 and, sadly, yet more after NBV was assaulted.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DSD and NBV brought proceedings against the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for the alleged failure of the police to
conduct effective investigations into Worboys’ crimes. The claims were brought
under sections 7 and 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). The combined effect
of these provisions (so far as this case is concerned) is to allow a person who
claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with
their rights under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) to bring proceedings against the public
authority and to be awarded damages.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The kernel of DSD and NBV’s claims is that the police failures in the
investigation of the crimes committed by Worboys constituted a violation of
their rights under article 3 of ECHR. This provides that “[n]o one shall be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” They
succeeded in that claim before Green J, who delivered judgment on the liability
issues on 28 February 2014, (Neutral Citation </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2014/436.html">[2014] EWHC 436 (QB)</a>). In a
second judgment handed down on 23 July 2014, (Neutral Citation <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2014/2493.html">[2014] EWHC 2493 (QB)</a>), Green J awarded compensation to DSD and NBV against MPS. An appeal by
MPS was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Lord Dyson MR, Laws and Kitchin LJJ)
on 30 June 2015, (Neutral Citation <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/646.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 646</a>): <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/646.html">[2016] QB 161</a>). MPS
has appealed to this court. The Secretary of State for the Home Department
(SSHD) intervened, making written and oral submissions. A number of other
parties intervened. Liberty intervened, as did jointly the organisations Rape
Crisis, England and Wales, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Southall
Black Sisters and the Nia Project. They made helpful written submissions and
valuable oral submissions.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this appeal MPS accepts that both respondents were subjected to
serious sexual assault by Worboys. It further accepts that there were
significant errors by the police in each of the investigations into the crimes
committed against them. MPS has said that, whatever the outcome of this appeal,
MPS will not seek to recoup any of the compensation and consequential costs
which have been paid.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>DSD and NBV have recovered compensation from Worboys and each of them
has received an award from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="ParaHeading">The principal issue</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is accepted that HRA imposes a general duty to investigate
ill-treatment amounting to a violation of article 3 of ECHR. The main area of
dispute is the nature of that duty. That issue has a number of themes. They can
be summarised as follows:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Is it a public duty or one owed to individual victims of the breach of
article 3?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Is it a systems or an operational duty?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Does the duty to investigate breaches of article 3 in relation to a
particular individual arise only when it is alleged that state authorities are
complicit in the breach?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the duty comprehends an obligation to investigate breaches of article
3, even if there is no involvement of state agents, is there a right to claim compensation
against the state?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Should the fact that a victim can obtain redress against an offender or
make a claim under the CICA scheme affect consideration of the availability of
a right to compensation under HRA?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(vi)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this context, is it relevant that UK courts have, so far, refused to
recognise a common-law duty of care on the police in relation to the manner in
which officers prevent and investigate crime?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">(vii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, it is suggested that it would require the clearest statement in
consistent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) Grand
Chamber to the effect that a positive duty was owed by the state to individuals
who suffered treatment contrary to article 3 at the hands of another individual
before holding that the investigative duty of the state was animated. If ECtHR
jurisprudence is found to be less than clear, the appropriate course was to
allow the government to deploy its arguments in Strasbourg - <i>R (Ullah) v
Special Adjudicator </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/26.html">[2004] 2 AC 323</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many of these themes overlap and blend into one another and it is
impossible to consider them other than compendiously, not least because that is
how they are treated in many of the relevant authorities, both domestic and
European. It is necessary at the outset, however, to recognise that examination
of the nature of the duty is a multi-faceted exercise.</a></p><a name="para7">

<p class="ParaHeading">The nature of the duty owed under HRA - the arguments</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant argues that the duty of the police to investigate, detect
and prosecute crime is of a communal nature; one which is owed to the public at
large, not to individual citizens. It is submitted that the “general rule” is
that no private law duty is owed to victims of crime. This is because it has
been deemed that it would not be “fair, just and reasonable” to impose such a
duty. The consistent theme of judicial decisions on the liability of the police
at common law has been, the appellant suggests, that there are overwhelming
public policy reasons that no such liability should be recognised. The Court of
Appeal in the present case had emphasised the importance of consistency between
the common law and HRA. It would be anomalous, the appellant contends, for
there to be different bases of duty owed by the police at common law and under
HRA. Many of the public policy considerations which militated against the recognition
of such a duty at common law apply with equal force to the duty to investigate
that arises under article 3 of HRA.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is accepted that there is a duty to investigate allegations of
ill-treatment which amount to a violation of article 3 but it is suggested that
this duty can be enforced through the disciplinary regime, under the
independent oversight of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The
existence of this regime, the appellant says, reflects the public nature of
that duty.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Insofar as article 3 of ECHR imposes a positive obligation to respond to
ill-treatment by a member of the public who is not a state agent, that
obligation, the appellant submits, is to put in place the legal structures
required to ensure that a proper inquiry can be conducted. It does not extend
to the operational content of an individual inquiry. The investigative
obligation in relation to individual cases arises only where state agents are
complicit in the alleged ill-treatment.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The SSHD submits that the origin of the investigative duty is <i>Assenov
v Bulgaria </i>(1998) 28 EHRR 652 where ECtHR stated that an effective official
investigation was required where there was an arguable claim of serious
ill-treatment “by the police or other such agents of the state unlawfully and
in breach of article 3” - para 102. It is therefore argued that the principled
foundation for the implication of an investigative duty is to underpin the
effectiveness of the express prohibition set out in article 3. That prohibition
could only apply, the SSHD argues, to agents of the state, not to private
individuals.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents’ riposte to these arguments is that the state has a duty
under article 3 to conduct an effective investigation into crimes which involve
serious violence to an individual. This is a positive, protective obligation to
take measures designed to ensure that individuals within its jurisdiction are
not subject to the treatment which article 3 prohibits. The duty is not an
abstract one owed to the public at large but can be invoked by an individual
who demonstrates that the state’s failure to fulfil its obligation has led to
her or his suffering treatment prohibited by the article.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents submit that the appellant’s argument about the need for
consistency between the common-law position and the availability of a claim
under HRA is, properly analysed, one of justiciability. They point out that the
appellant accepts that there is a domestic law duty to investigate effectively
serious criminal offences. It is accepted that there were several deficiencies
in the investigation of these offences. The decision by Parliament to enact HRA
effectively disposes of the issue of justiciability. The incorporation of ECHR
into domestic law made available to an individual a remedy for a breach by the
state of the article 3 protective obligation. This was entirely in line with
the jurisprudence of ECtHR.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, the respondents argue, the public policy considerations
which have been held to underlie the exemption from liability at common law do
not translate to the position under HRA. As Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood
held in <i>Van Colle v Chief Constable of Herts Police; Smith v Chief Constable
of Sussex Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/50.html">[2009] AC 225</a>, para 138, Convention claims have quite
different aims from civil actions.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the appellant’s argument that the duty of the state under article 3
is confined to putting in place legal structures to prohibit such ill-treatment
as is forbidden by the article, the respondents claim that this is
unsustainable, again in light of the decision in <i>Van Colle</i>. That
decision was premised on the existence of an operational duty to protect
against a real and immediate risk of serious violence.</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="ParaHeading">The relevant case law on the nature of the duty</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/651.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 20</a> the applicant complained that
she had been raped by two men when she was 14 years old. The men in question
were interviewed but it was concluded that they had not used threats or
violence and there was no evidence of resistance on the part of the
complainant. The district prosecutor therefore issued a decree terminating the
proceedings. The complainant’s application to ECtHR rested on the twin
assertions that Bulgarian law did not provide effective protection against rape
and sexual abuse as only cases where the victim had actively resisted were
prosecuted, and that the authorities had not properly investigated her
allegations. It is important to recognise that the court found that the failure
properly to investigate her allegations constituted violation of her rights
under articles 3 and 8 of ECHR. As I shall discuss below, the appellant has
concentrated on the first of the assertions made by the applicant in <i>MC</i>.
The second aspect of her complaint - that there was not a proper investigation
of her allegations is a distinct and unconnected ground on which the court
decided that article 3 had been breached.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 151 of <i>MC </i>ECtHR observed that, in a number of cases,
article 3 of ECHR gives rise to a positive obligation to conduct an official
investigation. The court expressly said that such positive obligations “cannot
be considered in principle to be limited solely to cases of ill-treatment by
state agents”. It concluded that the authorities had failed to explore the
surrounding circumstances - para 177. On that account, there was a violation of
the state’s positive obligation under article 3 - para 187. This was a duty
owed to the applicant personally and she was awarded compensation - para 194.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A significant passage from the court’s judgment is to be found in para
153:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the court considers that states
have a positive obligation inherent in articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to
enact criminal-law provisions, effectively punishing rape<i> and to apply them
in practice through effective investigation and prosecution</i>.” (Emphasis
supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The binary nature of the positive obligation arising under these
articles was noted by Green J in para 163 of his judgment: effective systems
and operational duties:</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… There were two relevant
aspects. First, whether the state of Bulgarian law on rape was so flawed as to
amount to a breach of the state’s positive obligation under articles 3 and 8
(the systemic failings). Secondly, to consider whether the alleged shortcomings
in the investigation were, also, so flawed as also to amount to a breach of the
state’s obligations under the same articles (the operational failings). Under
the heading ‘general approach’ the court explained that the duty to create a
corpus of law and the duty to ‘apply them in practice’ through investigation
and punishment were separate …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hughes has suggested (in para 117 of his judgment) that the
statement in para 153 of ECtHR’s judgment, that “article 3 carries an
obligation in some circumstances to investigate third party offending” leaves
“only uncertainties about its source and thus its extent”. What is not in the least
uncertain, however, is that, if the relevant circumstances are present, there
is a duty on the part of state authorities to investigate where non-state
agents are responsible for the infliction of the harm. That cannot be
characterised as other than an operational duty. The debate must focus,
therefore, not on the existence of such a duty but on the circumstances in
which it is animated.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is suggested (para 119 of Lord Hughes’ judgment) that <i>Calvelli and
Ciglio v Italy </i>(2002) (Application No 32967/96) does not provide authority
for the second proposition in para 151 of <i>MC, </i>namely, that positive
obligations to investigate cannot be considered in principle to be limited
solely to cases of ill-treatment by state agents. It should be observed,
however, that part of the applicants’ complaint in that case related to the
unexplained delay in the proper investigation of their representations that the
doctor who was ultimately charged with manslaughter was responsible for the
death of their child - see para 43 of the judgment. In other words, an
operational failure. At para 54, the court said this:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the instant case, the court
notes that the criminal proceedings instituted against the doctor concerned
became time-barred because of procedural shortcomings that led to delays,
particularly during the police inquiry and judicial investigation.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The rejection of the applicants’ case in <i>Calvelli and Ciglio </i>was
not because ECtHR considered that the duty to investigate was confined to “an
obligation to provide a sufficient investigative structure”, as Lord Hughes
puts it in the final sentence of para 119 of his judgment. To the contrary, the
Strasbourg court held that, because of the applicants’ entitlement to issue
proceedings in the civil courts and the fact that they entered into a
settlement agreement with the doctor’s insurers, they had waived their rights
to pursue criminal proceedings (para 54). Nothing in the court’s judgment
supports the suggestion that it was founded on a view that the extent of the
ancillary duty under article 2 was to provide a sufficient investigative
structure rather than a duty not to be negligent in the way in which the
inquiry was conducted. The court made that unequivocally clear in para 56 of
its judgment where it said that because the applicants had denied themselves
the “best means” of elucidating the extent of the doctor’s responsibility for
the death of their child, it was unnecessary to examine whether the time bar on
bringing proceedings prevented the doctor from being prosecuted. The coming
into force of the time bar had, of course, been contributed to by the
operational failure of the state authorities to conduct investigations more
expeditiously.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hughes has described the statement in para 152 of <i>MC </i>as
“tentative” - see para 121 of his judgment. It seems to me clear, however, that
the court was there recording that, hitherto, ECtHR had not excluded the
prospect that it would be held that actions by non-state agents would give rise
to positive obligations on the part of the state under articles 2 and 3 of
ECHR. <i>MC </i>provided the occasion to proclaim that such a positive
obligation existed.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to be an effective deterrent, laws which prohibit conduct
constituting a breach of article 3 must be rigorously enforced and complaints
of such conduct must be properly investigated. There is a clear line of
Strasbourg authority for the duty to properly investigate reported offences and
allegations of ill-treatment, which is summarised with approval at para 172 of <i>O’Keeffe
v Ireland</i> (35810/09):</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Court recalls the principles
outlined in <i>CAS v Romania</i> (cited above, paras 68-70) to the effect that
article 3 requires the authorities to conduct an effective official
investigation into alleged ill-treatment inflicted by private individuals which
investigation should, in principle, be capable of leading to the establishment
of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those
responsible. That investigation should be conducted independently, promptly and
with reasonable expedition. The victim should be able to participate
effectively.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has been suggested (Lord Hughes at para 123) that ECtHR in <i>MC </i>made
it clear that it regarded the deficiencies in the investigation as “the
consequence of, and part and parcel with, the flawed approach of the Bulgarian
system generally to the issue of lack of consent”. At para 179 the court said
this:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is highly significant that the
reason for that failure [to conduct a proper investigation] was, apparently,
the investigator’s and the prosecutors’ opinion that since what was alleged to
have occurred was a ‘date rape’, in the absence of ‘direct’ proof of rape, such
as traces of violence and resistance or calls for help, they could not infer
proof of lack of consent and, therefore, of rape from an assessment of all the
surrounding circumstances. That approach transpires clearly from the position
of the investigator and, in particular, from the Regional Prosecutor’s decision
of May 13, 1997 and the Chief Public Prosecutor’s decision of June 24, 1997.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the court was not suggesting in this passage that the
deficiencies in the investigation were somehow subsumed into the shortcomings
of the Bulgarian law. Nor was it suggested that deficiencies in investigation
had to be accompanied in all circumstances by systemic defects. In <i>MC, </i>the
lack of assiduity in the investigation could be explained because of the
inadequacy of that law but it does not follow that deficiencies in
investigation, if they are sufficiently egregious, cannot of themselves
constitute a violation of article 3. Cases decided after <i>MC </i>make that
unambiguously clear. I will discuss those cases presently.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Concentrating for the moment on <i>MC, </i>however, Lord Hughes suggests
that his thesis, that deficiencies in investigation were part and parcel of
“the flawed approach of the Bulgarian system generally”, was supported by the
words of para 168 which he quotes at para 122 of his judgment. In para 168,
ECtHR said that it was not concerned with “allegations of errors or isolated omissions
in the investigation”. The court accepted that it could not replace the
domestic authorities’ assessment of the facts of the case nor could it decide
on the alleged perpetrators’ criminal responsibility.</a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These statements must be seen in context. The Strasbourg court is a
supra-national body. There are obvious limitations on its opportunity to
examine deficiencies in investigation. National courts are not so constrained.
This case provides the perfect example. Green J heard detailed evidence of the errors
that had been made by police in the investigation of Worboys’ crimes. He was in
a position to form a judgment as to the impact of those errors on the
respondents’ cases. And it was open to him to find, as he correctly did, that
the errors were so serious that a violation of article 3 was established.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I cannot accept a suggestion that, to give rise to a breach of article
3, deficiencies in investigation had to be part and parcel of a flawed approach
of the system generally. I accept, however, that simple errors or isolated
omissions will not give rise to a violation of article 3 at the supra-national and<i>
</i>the national levels. That is why, as I point out below, only conspicuous or
substantial errors in investigation would qualify. The Strasbourg court disavowed
any close examination of the errors in investigation because it was a
supra-national court. It left that to national courts. But, my reference to
ECtHR’s disinclination to conduct such a close examination is not intended to
suggest that minor errors in investigation will give rise to a breach of the
Convention right on the national plane. To the contrary, as I make clear in
paras 53 and 72 below, errors in investigation, to give rise to a breach of
article 3, must be egregious and significant.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I hope is now clear, not every error in investigation will give rise
to a breach of article 3. But the difficulty in defining those errors which
qualify should not prompt capitulation to the notion that there has to be some
form of structural deficiency before egregious errors in the investigation of
the offences, such as occurred in this case, can amount to a breach of article
3. That proposition is strongly supported by consideration of cases decided
after <i>MC </i>and I turn now to those cases.</a></p><a name="para30">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case of <i>Szula v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/86.html">(2007) 44 EHRR SE19</a> involved a
complaint of sexual and physical abuse brought by a minor during the time that
he was in a residential approved school. The applicant’s claim was deemed
inadmissible but this was because it was concluded that there was “no
indication that the authorities showed any lack of diligence or expedition” in
the investigation of his allegations. Implicit in that finding was that, had
there been such an indication, the applicant’s case would have been admissible.
It has been suggested that this case is an example of the court having looked
for evidence of a structural defect or culpable disregard or an absence of good
faith in the administration of the domestic system (para 26). I do not agree.
In that case the court expressly recognised that the criminal law prohibited
the physical and sexual abuse alleged by the applicant. True it is that the
court, after reviewing steps taken by police and prosecuting authorities, also
said (in para 1 of its judgment):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“While that sequence of events was
somewhat unfortunate, the court does not consider that it discloses any
culpable disregard, discernible bad faith or lack of will on the part of the
police or prosecuting authorities as regards properly holding perpetrators of
serious criminal offences accountable pursuant to domestic law.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unquestionably clear that these observations were made in relation
to the discharge by the police and the prosecuting authorities of their <i>operational
duties.</i> There is no hint in the judgment that this was in any way related
to a “structural defect”. As I have said, the court had examined the criminal
law system and not found it wanting. I cannot accept, therefore, that the
quoted passage had anything whatever to do with a systemic or structural failure.
It was plainly pertinent - and only pertinent - to a review of the operational
actions and decisions of the police and prosecuting authorities. The fact that
the court considered it necessary to conduct such a review, when no systemic
defect was present, is important, however. It can only have been necessary if
the court considered that a purely operational failing, entirely unrelated to
any “structural defect”, could have given rise to a violation of article 3.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>In <i>Secic v Croatia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/1159.html">(2009) 49 EHRR 18</a> (31 May 2007), ECtHR
considered a complaint of ineffective criminal investigation of a racially
motivated physical assault. The court again repeated the statement from <i>MC</i>
that article 3 may give rise to a positive obligation to conduct an official
investigation - para 53. The court stated that the obligation on the state to
conduct an official investigation is one of means, not result, referring to the
article 2 cases of <i>Menson v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/107.html">(2003) 37 EHRR CD 220</a> and <i>Yasa
v Turkey</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/83.html">(1999) 28 EHRR 408</a>. At para 54, however, it observed that the
authorities had to take “all reasonable steps available to them to secure the
evidence concerning the incident” and that the authorities must act with
“promptness and reasonable expedition.” Having considered the investigations
conducted by the police, ECtHR concluded, at para 59, that “the failure of the
state authorities to further the case or obtain any tangible evidence with a
view to identifying and arresting the attackers over a prolonged period of time
indicates that the investigation did not meet the requirements of article 3 of
the Convention”. It therefore found that article 3 had been breached and that
the applicant was entitled to be compensated. Lord Hughes has cited this case
as an example where there were “plain overtones of structural State
deficiencies in relation to the investigation of allegations of racially
motivated or discriminatory violence” (para 126).</p>

</span>The applicant’s submissions are set out in paras 38-42 of the court’s
judgment. None of these submissions touched on any structural or systemic
deficiency in Croatian law or procedure. To the contrary, the applicant
complained that Croatian law provided for many processes and police methods
which the police had failed to follow. He also complained that they had failed
to apply to a Croatian court for an order compelling a journalist to reveal the
name of an interviewee who might have been able to shed light on the attack on
him. Such an application could have been made under section 30 of the Media
Act. No complaint was made about any inadequacy in that provision. All of the
applicant’s complaints were in relation to the operational failings of the
police.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Croatian government’s submissions are set out in paras 43-48 of the
Strasbourg court’s judgment. Apart from claiming that the applicant’s
ill-treatment did not reach the threshold required for a breach of article 3
and that the positive obligation under that article arose only where the state
had been made aware of acts which it was reasonable to expect them to prevent,
all the government’s submissions were focused on a defence of the operational
decisions and actions of the police. The question of systemic deficiencies was
simply not in play in this case. That is obvious also from the court’s
decision. At para 53 the court said that article 3 may give rise to a positive
obligation to conduct an official investigation. This was not, in principle,
limited to cases of ill-treatment by state agents. And at para 54 the court
said this:</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the court reiterates that the
scope of the … obligation by the state is one of means, not of result; the
authorities must have taken all reasonable steps available to them to secure
the evidence concerning the incident. A requirement of promptness and
reasonable expedition of the investigation is implicit in this context.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The complaint of lack of promptness related solely to police inaction.
Nothing about any structural or systemic deficiency was instanced. And the
remainder of the court’s judgment focused entirely on the operational failings
of the police. For my part, therefore, I have not been able to find any
overtones of structural state deficiencies in the report of this case.</a></p><a name="para36">

</span></i><i>v Croatia </i>(Application No 46423/06) 25 June 2009 was a case
in which the applicant had been assaulted by three individuals. Although ECtHR
acknowledged (in para 69 of its judgment) that no direct responsibility can
attach to a member state under ECHR for the acts of private individuals, it
stated (in paras 70 and 71):</a></p><a name="para37">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … even in the absence of
any direct responsibility for the acts of a private individual under article 3
of the Convention, State responsibility may nevertheless be engaged through the
obligation imposed by article 1 of the Convention. In this connection the Court
reiterates that the obligation on the High Contracting Parties under article 1
of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights
and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with article 3, requires
States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their
jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment, including such ill-treatment&nbsp; administered by private individuals
(see <i>A v United Kingdom</i>, cited above, para 22).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … In order that a state
may be held responsible it must … be shown that the domestic legal system, and
in particular the criminal law applicable in the circumstances of the case, <i>fails

</span>The court made clear that, as well as examining the “impugned
regulations and practices, and in particular the domestic authorities’
compliance with the relevant procedural rules”, it would also consider “the
manner in which the criminal mechanisms were implemented in the instant case” -
para 74. At para 75, ECtHR set out the “minimum standards applicable” in
respect of “the duty to investigate”. They included that the investigation be
independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the authorities
act with diligence and promptness. It also reiterated that “for an
investigation to be considered effective, the authorities must take whatever
reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident,
including, inter alia, a detailed statement concerning the allegations from the
alleged victim, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate,
additional medical reports”. The failings in fact identified in this case arose
at the post-investigative stage and ECtHR confirmed the principle that the
requirement for effective criminal law provisions extends to the trial phase of
proceedings - para 77.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>The ECtHR decided that the state authorities did not fulfil their
positive obligations under article 3. Violation of that article was found.
Compensation was awarded to the applicant. The various elements of an effective

</span>In the case of <i>Vasilyev v Russia</i> (Application No 32704/04) 17 December
2009 the applicant and his friend were seriously assaulted and robbed. Although
police officers attended the scene, no investigation into the circumstances of
the assault were conducted. The police officers claimed to have considered that
the applicant and his friend were intoxicated, so they moved them from the
position where they had been found and left them. A number of criminal
investigations were subsequently instituted, largely on the initiative of the
applicant’s mother. It was decided to suspend the proceedings because the
perpetrators could not be identified. This decision was reversed and restored
on a number of occasions. The two police officers who had attended the scene
were prosecuted for failing to fulfil their legal duty to protect victims of
offences. They were acquitted.</a></p><a name="para40">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The applicant did not lay blame on the state authorities for the attack;
nor was it suggested that they knew or ought to have known that the applicant
was at risk of physical violence at the hands of third parties. The court
explicitly found, however, that this did not absolve the state from obligations
under article 3. At para 99, it said that what the article required was that
“the authorities conduct an effective investigation into the alleged
ill-treatment even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals”.
It elaborated on this statement at para 100:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… For the investigation to be
regarded as ‘effective’, it should in principle be capable of leading to the
establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment
of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means.
The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to
secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, <i>inter alia, </i>eyewitness
testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation
which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity
of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a
requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context
(see, among many authorities, <i>Mikheyev v Russia</i>, no 77617/01, para 107

</span>A similar approach to that in the cases already discussed is found in
later decisions of ECtHR such as <i>Milanovic v Serbia</i> (Application No 44614/07)
14 December 2010, <i>CAS v Romania </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/512.html">(2015) 61 EHRR 18</a> and <i>BV v Croatia </i>(Application

concerning the procedural obligations in <i>CAS v Romania </i>(which reflected
the exposition of those in the cases considered in detail above) was expressly
endorsed by the Grand Chamber in <i>O’Keefe v Ireland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/96.html">(2014) 59 EHRR 15</a>.
These propositions have been reiterated by the second section of ECtHR most
recently in <i>BV v Belgium</i> (Application No 61030/08) 2 May 2017. At para
56 the court stated that the obligation to carry out an effective investigation
“cannot be limited to cases of ill-treatment by agents of the state”.</p>

said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Your Lordships have been referred
to many decisions of the European Court of Human Rights on article 6 of the
Convention. Although the Human Rights Act 1998 does not provide that a national

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondents argue that the authorities which I have reviewed above
constitute clear and constant jurisprudence to the effect that the state has a
duty under article 3 to conduct an effective investigation into crimes which
involve serious violence to an individual. In order that the protective right
under the article be practical and effective, the respondents also assert that
failure to conduct such an investigation gives rise to a right to hold the
state to account by, among other things, a claim for compensation on the part
of a person who was a victim of the article 3 violation and the state’s failure
to discharge its obligations under the article.</a></p><a name="para45">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant counters this argument, claiming that the Strasbourg
court’s extensive case law (including decisions of the Grand Chamber) refers
back to <i>Assenov</i> as the authoritative source of the obligation, derived
from article 3, to investigate allegations of ill-treatment by state agents. It
is suggested that <i>Assenov </i>explicitly limits the investigative duty to
cases where the ill-treatment has been perpetrated “by the police or other such
agents of the state unlawfully and in breach of article 3” (para 102). This
approach, it is claimed, has been followed by decisions of the Grand Chamber in
such cases as <i>Gäfgen v Germany</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/759.html">(2011) 52 EHRR 1</a> and <i>El-Masri v The

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted, of course, that <i>Assenov </i>was a case where the
claim was based on allegations against state agents, namely, the Bulgarian
police. When, therefore, the court expressed the view, which it did in para 102
of its judgment, that, “where an individual raises an arguable claim that he
has been seriously ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the State
unlawfully and in breach of article 3, that provision … requires by implication
that there should be an effective official investigation”, it did not address
the question whether such a duty arose where the perpetrators of the ill-treatment
were not state agents. It did not need to do so. The issue simply did not arise
in that case.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, in <i>Gäfgen </i>the complaint was made concerning the
applicant’s ill-treatment by police. So also in <i>El-Masri </i>the applicant
claimed that he had suffered ill-treatment at the hands of state agents and
that they had been actively involved in his subsequent rendition by CIA agents.
Statements in the judgments in both cases which echo that in <i>Assenov</i>
quoted in the preceding paragraph do not sound on the question whether
ill-treatment by individuals other than state agents can give rise to the duty
to investigate under article 3. Those decisions do not impinge upon, much less
derogate from, the authority of the cases decided by ECtHR between 2005 and
2017 discussed in paras 16 to 28 above. I consider that those cases amount to
clear and constant case law of the Strasbourg court. And I have concluded that
they establish that the state is obliged under article 3 to conduct an
effective investigation into crimes which involve serious violence to persons,
whether that has been carried out by state agents or individual criminals.
Further, in order that the protective right should be practical and effective,
an individual who has suffered ill-treatment contrary to article 3 has a right
to claim compensation against the state where there has been a failure by state

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 127 of Lord Hughes’ judgment, he suggests that the proper test
for the positive obligation to investigate reports of past violence under
article 3 is whether the state “has a proper structure of legal provision
designed to punish it when it occurs and has administered [it] in good faith
and with proper regard for the gravity of the behaviour under consideration”.
It is not clear whether this formulation excludes any investigation of
operational failings on the part of state authorities such as the police.
Conceivably, I suppose, a failure to administer the proper structure of criminal
legal provisions might entail an examination of the way in which police
conducted their inquiries into a particular case. But, importantly, the duty to
administer is qualified in Lord Hughes’ exposition by the stipulation that the
administration of the structure of legal provision, if it is to fall foul of
the test, must be shown to have been conducted in bad faith or without proper
regard for the gravity of the behaviour involved. This places an obvious
limitation on the scope of any review of the operational actions and decisions
of the police. There is no suggestion in this case, for instance, that the
police acted in bad faith. It might possibly be said that there were instances
of the police failing to have regard for the gravity of the crimes which the
respondents complained of but I am unsure whether this would fulfil Lord
Hughes’ test because the failure to have due regard to the gravity of the crime
must take place in the context of the administration of the proper structure of
legal provisions.</a></p><a name="para49">

</span>It is true, as Lord Hughes says in para 140, that there were structural
errors. But I cannot agree with his statement that the various detailed
failings in the conduct of the inquiry were “largely attributable to this
flawed structural approach”. Green J dealt with the operational failures in
these two cases in a long passage of his judgment between paras 285 and 313.
Some of these were related by him to lack of training but many were not.
Significantly, the judge found that if the operational failings had not occurred,
the police officers involved in the investigation “would have taken steps which
would have been capable of identifying and arresting Worboys”.</a></p><a name="para50">

</span>It is unnecessary to list all the operational failings. These are set
out in admirable and clear detail by the trial judge in his judgment. It is
sufficient to refer to a sample of these to explain why I do not accept that
these were largely attributable to a flawed structural approach.</a></p><a name="para51">

</span>None of these failures can be described as a failure in training or in
the structures that were in place for the investigation of serious crime at the
material time. Many other operational failures, none of which can be ascribed
to a “flawed structural approach” were found by Green J to have occurred. These
were considered by him to have contributed in a significant way to his finding
that a breach of article 3 had been established. If I have understood Lord
Hughes’ formulation of the relevant test correctly, none of them was relevant to
that conclusion.</a></p><a name="para52">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The prospect of every complaint of burglary, car theft or fraud becoming
the subject of an action under the Human Rights Act has been raised. I do not
believe that this is a serious possibility. All of the cases in this area
involve conspicuous and substantial shortcomings in the conduct of the police
and prosecutorial investigation. And, as this case illustrates, frequently,
operational failures will be accompanied by systemic defects. The recognition
that really serious operational failures by police in the investigation of
offences can give rise to a breach of article 3 cannot realistically be said to
herald an avalanche of claims for every retrospectively detected error in
police investigations of minor crime.</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="ParaHeading">A systems or an operational duty?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant argued that <i>MC v Bulgaria </i>should not be taken as
authority for the proposition that how the state carried out its investigative
duty at an operational level required to be examined in order to determine
whether article 3 had been breached. That case, it was said, involved a systemic
problem with Bulgarian law in relation to sexual offences. Under that law, it
was not sufficient, in a rape prosecution, to show that a complainant had not
consented to sexual intercourse. It was necessary to show that she was
incapable of defending herself, or that she had been compelled by force or
threats or that she had been brought to a state of defencelessness. The case
was therefore primarily concerned with the system of laws in Bulgaria, the
appellant claimed, and the court did not find a breach of article 3 because of
any particular failing in the investigation in isolation, but because the legal
system itself was deficient. The appellant claims that nothing in the judgment
says in positive terms that article 3 gives rise to an obligation to investigate
in cases where the state is not complicit in ill-treatment.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not accept these arguments. As pointed out in para 18 above, the
Strasbourg court in <i>MC </i>clearly specified that the state’s duty had two
aspects. The first was to enact criminal-law provisions which would effectively
punish rape. The second, distinct but definite obligation was to carry out
proper investigation and prosecution so that the laws could be applied
effectively. It should be noted that the applicant’s complaint in that case had
two separate aspects, described in para 109 of the judgment as follows:</a></p><a name="para55">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The applicant complained that
Bulgarian law and practice did not provide effective protection against rape
and sexual abuse as only cases where the victim had resisted actively were
prosecuted <i>and that the authorities had not investigated the events of July
31 and August 1, 1995 effectively</i>.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second aspect of her complaint was elaborated on in para 117 of the
judgment where it is recorded that she alleged that the investigation had not
been thorough and complete. The crucial issue of the timing of all the
movements of the men and the applicant during the night in question had not
been investigated.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court’s conclusions on the second aspect of the applicant’s
complaint were unmistakable. At paras 176-178 it said:</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“176.&nbsp; The court recognises that
the Bulgarian authorities faced a difficult task, as they were confronted with
two conflicting versions of the events and little ‘direct’ evidence. The court
does not underestimate the efforts invested by the investigator and the
prosecutors in their work on the case.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">177.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It notes, nonetheless,
that the presence of two irreconcilable versions of the facts obviously called
for a context-sensitive assessment of the credibility of the statements made
and for verification of all the surrounding circumstances. Little was done,
however, to test the credibility of the version of the events proposed by P and
A [the alleged rapists] and the witnesses called by them. In particular, the
witnesses whose statements contradicted each other, such as Ms T and Mr M, were
not confronted. No attempt was made to establish with more precision the timing
of the events. The applicant and her representative were not given the
opportunity to put questions to the witnesses whom she accused of perjury. In
their decisions, the prosecutors did not devote any attention to the question
whether the story proposed by P and A was credible when some of their
statements called for caution, such as the assertion that the applicant, 14
years old at the time, had started caressing A minutes after having had sex for
the first time in her life with another man.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">178.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court thus considers
that the authorities failed to explore the available possibilities for establishing
all the surrounding circumstances and did not assess sufficiently the
credibility of the conflicting statements made.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Plainly, therefore, the court made a separate finding in relation to the
inadequacy of the police investigation. This finding was entirely freestanding
of its conclusions in relation to the systemic deficiencies in the Bulgarian
law in relation to rape. That approach has been consistently followed in the
cases examined above. It is incontestably clear, therefore, that the positive
obligation to conduct a proper inquiry into behaviour amounting to breach of
article 3 may constitute a violation of the state’s duty under the article.</a></p><a name="para58">

<p class="ParaHeading">Is state complicity a prerequisite?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer to the argument that the positive obligation to investigate
is animated only where there is state involvement in the acts said to breach
article 3 can be simply supplied by reference to the passage from para 151 of <i>MC</i>
quoted at para 17 above. The statement that positive obligations are not solely
confined to cases of ill-treatment by state agents could not be clearer.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para60">“In general, actions incompatible
with article 3 of the Convention primarily incur the liability of a Contracting
State if they were inflicted by persons holding an official position. However,
the obligation on the High Contracting Parties under article 1 of the
Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and
freedoms defined in the Convention, taken in conjunction with article 3, also
requires states to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within
their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment administered by other
private persons (see <i>A v United Kingdom, </i>judgment of 23 September 1998,

</span>Likewise, in <i>CAS v Romania </i>where there was no question of state
involvement in the sexual abuse of the first applicant, the court was
unambiguous in its finding that this was not a prerequisite to a breach of
article 3. At para 69, it said:</a></p><a name="para61">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the absence of any direct state
responsibility for acts of violence that meet the condition of severity such as
to engage article 3 of the Convention does not absolve the state from all

</span>I am satisfied, therefore, that ECtHR has consistently held<i> </i>that
it is not required that there be state involvement in the acts alleged to
amount to breach of article 3. The appellant’s argument based on that
proposition must be rejected.</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="ParaHeading">Compensation</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The themes outlined in para 6 (iv) and (v) above may be taken together.
They can be dealt with briefly. Compensation is by no means automatically
payable for breaches of the article 3 duty to investigate and prosecute crime.
As Lord Bingham pointed out in <i>R (Greenfield) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/14.html">[2005] 1 WLR 673</a>, para 8, in many cases the Strasbourg
court has <a name="para8">treated the finding of the violation as, in itself,
just satisfaction under article 41 (although that was said in the context of article
6 breaches).</a></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is well settled, however, that the award of compensation for breach
of a Convention right serves a purpose which is distinctly different from that
of an order for the payment of damages in a civil action. As Lord Brown said in
<i>Van Colle</i> at para 138:</a></p><a name="para64">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Convention claims have very
different objectives from civil actions. Where civil actions are designed
essentially to compensate claimants for their losses, Convention claims are
intended rather to uphold minimum human rights standards and to vindicate those
rights. That is why time limits are markedly shorter. … It is also why section
8(3) of the [HRA] provides that no damages are to be awarded unless necessary
for just satisfaction …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Laws LJ said in para 68 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal, that the
inquiry into compliance with the article 3 duty is “first and foremost
concerned, not with the effect on the claimant, but with the overall nature of
the investigative steps to be taken by the State”. I agree with that. The award
of compensation is geared principally to the upholding of standards concerning
the discharge of the state’s duty to conduct proper investigations into
criminal conduct which falls foul of article 3. In paras 72-78 of his judgment,
Laws LJ set out the systemic and operational failures of the appellant, quoting
extensively from the judgment of Green J as to the first of these. That
catalogue of failures was considered to warrant the award of compensation to
the respondents, irrespective of the fact that they had received damages from
both Worboys and CICA. I cannot find any flaw in the judge’s decision to award
that compensation nor in the Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold that
decision.</a></p><a name="para65">

<p class="ParaHeading">The relevance of the circumstance that there is no common law
duty of care</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Van Colle </i>and<i> Smith</i>, two associated cases heard
together, the complaint was that police had failed to follow up reports of
threats to kill. In <i>Van Colle,</i> the alleged failure had resulted, it was
claimed, in the killing of the individual who was the subject of the threats.
In <i>Smith,</i> the victim was seriously injured. The first case was brought
solely under HRA, alleging violation of article 2. It failed on its facts. In <i>Smith,</i>
no HRA claim was made. The appellant relied solely on the common law, alleging
negligence by the police. The House of Lords rejected the argument that “the
common law should now be developed to reflect the Strasbourg jurisprudence
about the positive obligation arising under articles 2 and 3 of the Convention”
(para 136). A similar approach was taken by the majority in this court in <i>Michael
v Chief Constable of South Wales Police </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] AC 1732</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Laws LJ, in the Court of Appeal in this case, pointed out, the
essence of the argument on behalf of the appellants in those cases was that the
common law rule (that police owe “no general duty of care. … to identify or
apprehend an unknown criminal, nor. … a duty of care to individual members of
the public who might suffer injury through the criminal’s activities …” - <i>Hill
v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/12.html">[1989] AC 53</a>) should be
moderated so as to accommodate the ECHR - para 30. As he observed, the converse
is contended for in this appeal. The appellant and the Secretary of State argue
that the exemption from liability of the police at common law should be extended
to claims advanced under HRA so that the two systems should be in harmony.
There are two reasons for rejecting the argument.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the first place, the bases of liability are different, as mentioned
at para 44 above. In as much as it was considered that the common-law duty
should not be adapted to harmonise with the perceived duty arising under ECHR,
so should the latter duty remain free from the influence of the pre-HRA
domestic law. Alternatively, it requires, at least, to be considered on its own
merits, without the encumbrance of the corpus of jurisprudence under common-law.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly and more importantly, no assumption should be made that the
policy reasons which underlay the conclusion that an exemption of police from
liability at common law apply <i>mutatis mutandi </i>to liability for breach of
Convention rights. In <i>Michael </i>much of the debate as to whether police
owed a duty to an individual member of the public centred on the question
whether there was a sufficient proximity of relationship between the claimant
and the police force against whom action was taken. No such considerations
arise in the present context. The issue here is simple. Did the state through
the police force fail to comply with its protective obligation under article 3?</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The other principal argument advanced on behalf of the police in <i>Michael
</i>was that it would not be “fair, just and reasonable” to impose liability on
them for failings in individual cases. This is a concept with which the common
law, with its innate flexibility, can cope but it is not one which can easily
be accommodated in Convention jurisprudence. The police either have a
protective duty under article 3 or they do not. The presence of the duty cannot
depend on one’s conception of whether it is fair, just or reasonable for it to
exist.</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hughes has said (in para 130 of his judgment) that law enforcement
and the investigation of crime involve a complex series of judgments and
discretionary decisions; that they concern the choice of lines of inquiry, the
weighing of evidence and the allocation of finite resources. All of that is unexceptionable.
But the claim that to “re-visit such matters step-by-step by way of litigation
… would inhibit the robust operation of police work … divert resources from
current inquiries [and act as a deterrent] not a spur to law enforcement” is
unsupported by any evidence. In the first place, none of the cases cited above
required a painstaking, minute examination of decisions taken by police.
Nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence suggests that this would be
appropriate, much less that it would be even admissible, as the basis for
advancing a claim under article 3. Carrying out police investigations
efficiently should not give rise to a diversion of resources. On the contrary,
it should lead to more effective investigation of crime, the enhancement of standards
and the saving of resources. There is no reason to suppose that the existence
of a right under article 3 to call to account egregious errors on the part of
the police in the investigation of serious crime would do other than act as an
incentive to avoid those errors and to deter, indeed eliminate, the making of
such grievous mistakes.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The statement made by Lord Hughes (in para 130) about the undesirability
of the investigation of terrorist activity and the “delicate and difficult
decisions” it involves being subject to review would be a powerful factor, if
it were a possible consequence of following the jurisprudence of ECtHR in this
area. But, in my view, it is not. Nothing in that case law supports the notion
that a charter has been created for the examination of every judgment or choice
of strategy made. As I have said, only obvious and significant shortcomings in
the conduct of the police and prosecutorial investigation will give rise to the
possibility of a claim. There is no reason to suppose that courts will not be
able to forestall challenges to police inquiries based on spurious or
speculative claims.</a></p><a name="para72">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was strongly argued, particularly on behalf of the Secretary of
State, that the question whether a liability such as that contended for by the
respondents arises was one on which ECtHR should be invited to pronounce. The

Lord Brown suggested that where ECtHR had not spoken, our courts should hold
back, explaining that, if it proved that Convention rights have been denied by

corrected in Strasbourg. And <i>in R (Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The difficulty with the argument is that it fails to address the
circumstance that the courts of this country, constituted as they are as public
authorities, must give effect to (or refuse to give effect to) Convention
rights as a matter of domestic law.<i> </i>The HRA introduced to the law of the
United Kingdom the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
by making the Convention part of national law so that the rights became
domestic rights. Because the rights are domestic, they must be given effect
according to the correct interpretation of the domestic statute.<i> </i>As Lord
Hoffmann said <i>In re G (Adoption: Unmarried Couple)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2008] UKHL 38</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2009] AC 173</a>, para 34 “[the courts’] first duty is to give effect to the
domestic statute according to what they consider to be its proper meaning, even
if its provisions are in the same language as the international instrument
which is interpreted in Strasbourg”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The so-called “mirror principle” (whereby pronouncements by national
courts on Convention rights should precisely match those of Strasbourg) is
often attributed to Lord Bingham’s statement in <i>Ullah </i>at para 20 where
he said “The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg
jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more but certainly no less”. As
explained in para 232 of <i>R (Keyu) v Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/69.html">[2015] UKSC 69</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/69.html">[2016] AC 1355</a>, Lord Bingham was
careful to refer to the interpretation of the Convention (as opposed to the
interpretation of HRA). Despite this, his opinion in that case has been used in
a number of subsequent judgments to support the proposition that the content of
domestic rights under HRA should not, as a matter of principle, differ from
that pronounced by Strasbourg. Indeed, his judgment has been construed as
indicating that, unless ECtHR has given clear guidance on the nature and
content of a particular Convention right, the national courts of the United Kingdom
should refrain from recognising the substance of a claimed entitlement under
ECHR - see, for instance, <i>Al-Skeini, Smith </i>and<i> Ambrose, </i>referred
to in para 74 above.</p>

</span>In more recent cases, a departure from the mirror principle can be
detected. Thus, in <i>Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust (INQUEST
intervening) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/2.html">[2012] UKSC 2</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/2.html">[2012] 2 AC 72</a> it was held that there was a
positive obligation to protect the life of a mentally ill young woman who had
been admitted to hospital informally because of serious attempts to take her
own life. This decision was reached notwithstanding the fact that there was no
authority from ECtHR to that effect.<i> </i>In <i>Surrey County Council v P
(Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/19.html">[2014] UKSC 19</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/19.html">[2014] AC 896</a>, para 62 Lord Neuberger said that where there was no Strasbourg

said:</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This seems to me to be inescapably correct. Reticence by the courts of
the UK to decide whether a Convention right has been violated would be an
abnegation of our statutory obligation under section 6 of HRA. This section
makes it unlawful for a public authority, including a court, to act in a way
which is incompatible with a Convention right.</a></p><a name="para78">

Strasbourg court is clear and constant on the issues which this court has to
decide. Even if it were not, however, I would firmly reject the suggestion that
the decision of this court on whether the respondents enjoy a right under the
HRA to claim compensation against the appellant should be influenced, much less

</span>The claimants, DSD and NBV, succeeded before Green J in establishing
that they were entitled to damages from the defendant, the Commissioner of the
Police of the Metropolis, as a result of failures by the police properly to
investigate serious sexual assaults which had been perpetrated against them.
The claims were founded on the propositions that (i) article 3 of the European
Convention on Human Rights carries with it an obligation on the state to carry
out an effective investigation when it receives a credible allegation that
serious harm has been caused to an individual, and (ii) there were serious
defects in the police investigation of the assaults on the claimants.</a></p><a name="para81">

</span>The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, and this court takes the same
view. However, we disagree on one issue. That issue is whether a person in the
claimants’ position needs to establish that the serious defects in the
investigation in question were attributable to failures of a structural nature
(also referred to as systems, or systemic, failures), and not to purely
operational failures (ie failings on the part of the individual police officers
responsible for conducting the specific investigation).</a></p><a name="para82">

</span>We do not need to decide this issue in order to resolve the appeal, but
I agree that we should do so. It has been fully and helpfully argued by the

expounded by Lord Kerr and Lord Hughes, and it seems to me to be an important

</span>The competing arguments have been fully set out in the judgments of Lord
Kerr and Lord Hughes. Lord Kerr favours the wider approach, namely that a
claimant need only establish serious defects in the investigation into her
particular case, irrespective of whether they are systemic or operational
failures. Lord Hughes prefers the narrower approach, the effect of which is
that a claimant has to establish serious failings of a systemic nature, and
that failings of a purely operational nature will not suffice, at least where
the perpetrator of the alleged assault was not a state agent.</a></p><a name="para84">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In agreement with Lord Kerr, I am of the view, that serious failures
which are purely operational will suffice to establish a claim that an
investigation carried out pursuant to an article 3 (or indeed an article 2)
duty infringed that duty.</a></p><a name="para85">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So far as the Strasbourg jurisprudence is concerned, I consider that the
judgments to which we have been referred support the wider approach. The investigatory
duty was identified in <i>Assenov v Bulgaria </i>(1998) 28 EHRR 652, para 102,
where the court said that article 3, read with article 1, “requires by
implication that there should be an effective official investigation” into
cases where “an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously
ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the state unlawfully and in
breach of article 3”. I also note that the wider approach appears to have been
adopted by the Grand Chamber in the article 2 case of <span class="s7d2086b4"><i>Mustafa
Tunç and Fecire Tunç</i></span><span class="s7d2086b4"> <i>v Turkey</i></span>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2015/383.html">[2015] ECHR 383</a> - see at paras 183-209.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87">87.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I accept of course that those decisions were concerned with cases of
ill-treatment by state agents, and that the approval of the principle in other
decisions of the Grand Chamber (eg <i>Gäfgen v Germany</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/759.html">(2010) 52 EHRR 1</a> and
<i>El Masri v The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/2067.html">(2012) 57 EHRR 25</a>)
were also concerned with such cases. I also accept that the standard which a
court should apply when considering whether the investigatory duty has been
satisfied may well be more stringent in cases where the alleged ill-treatment
was caused by state agents than in cases where it was caused by others.
However, I see no basis for holding that the duty is different in kind in the
two types of case. While in a number of Strasbourg court decisions, it is
stated that the duty extends to cases where the alleged ill-treatment was
caused by third parties, there is no suggestion that the nature of the duty to
investigate is different in kind in the two types of case. Thus, in the recent
case of <i>BV v Belgium</i> (Application No 61030/08) 2 May 2017, para 56 the
court stated that the obligation to carry out an effective investigation
“cannot be limited to cases of ill-treatment by agents of the state”, without
suggesting that there was any difference in the basic nature of the duty.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88">88.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that in <i>Beganović v Croatia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/992.html">[2009] ECHR 992</a>, para
69, the court said that “<a name="para69">the scope of the State’s positive
obligations might differ between cases where treatment contrary to article 3 of
the Convention has been inflicted through the involvement of state agents and
cases where violence is inflicted by private individuals</a>”. However, even
without considering other decisions of the Strasbourg court, that seems to me
to be a very small peg on which to hang a contention that the two cases require
approaches which differ in nature. In any event, when that observation was
repeated in <i>Vasilyev v Russia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/2078.html">[2009] ECHR 2078</a>, para 100, the court
immediately went on to make the point that “<a name="para100">the requirements as
to an official investigation are similar</a>”, and that was a point repeated in
a number of subsequent decisions - see eg <i>Koky v Slovakia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/994.html">[2012] ECHR 994</a>, para 215, <i>Amadayev v Russia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/704.html">[2014] ECHR 704</a>, para 70, and <i>MC and
AC v Romania</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2016/359.html">[2016] ECHR 359</a>, para 111. Indeed, I note that in <i>Beganović
</i>itself, when considering whether the investigatory duty had been complied
with in a case where the alleged perpetrator had been a non-state agent, the
court said in para 74 that it should consider “<a name="para74">whether or not
the impugned regulations and practices, and in particular the domestic
authorities’ compliance with the relevant procedural rules, as well as the
manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant
case, were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent
state’s positive obligations under article 3</a>”. And the subsequent analysis
of the facts in paras 80-86, which led the court to conclude that there had
been a violation in that case, focussed very much on the operational failures.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89">89.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That approach appears to be supported by other Strasbourg court
decisions involving the investigatory duty in relation to acts of serious ill-treatment
by non-state agents. There is no suggestion in <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/651.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 20</a> that that duty is restricted to having effective systems in place: at
para 153, the court referred to the duty of a state “to enact criminal-law
provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through
effective investigation and prosecution”. In para 167, the court seems to me to
have been referring to both systemic and operational failures when it mentioned
“significant flaws” in “the impugned legislation and practice and its
application in the case at hand, combined with the alleged shortcomings in the
investigation” (and see para 179). The finding of inadmissibility in <i>Szula v
United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/86.html">(2007) 44 EHRR SE19</a> appears to me to have been based on the
assumption that operational failures would, in principle, suffice to found a
claim - see para 1.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90">90.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To the same effect, in <i>Šečić v Croatia</i> (2007) 49 EHRR
18, the court said in para 54 that the police should have taken “all reasonable
steps available to them” to obtain relevant evidence, which, as a matter of
ordinary language, naturally refers to operational steps. In para 59 the court
concluded that what appear to me to have been operational, rather than
structural, failures (summarised in paras 56-58) enabled the article 3 claim to
succeed. In <i>Beganović</i>, para 75, the court made the point that “the
duty to investigate” involved “the authorities [having to] take whatever
reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident” -
which covers operational matters at least as much as systems. <i>Vasilyev </i>is
another case where the court described the duty in terms which are, at least in
my view, significantly more consistent with the wider approach, namely that “the
authorities [should] conduct an effective investigation” involving “the
reasonable steps available to them” (paras 99 and 100). In the 2016 case of <i>Chernaya
v Ukraine </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2016/1117.html">[2016] ECHR 1117</a>, which involved an injury inflicted by a
non-state agent, the court reiterated in para 25 that “<span lang="EN-US">[t]he
minimum standards of effectiveness laid down by the Court’s case law include
the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject
to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities must act with exemplary
diligence and promptness” - again focusing on the operational aspects of the
particular investigation.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91">91.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang="EN-US">Of course, this Court is not required to follow
Strasbourg jurisprudence, even in a case such as this where there is a clear
and consistent approach adopted in a significant number of chamber decisions.
Dialogue between the United Kingdom Supreme Court (and indeed other courts in
the United Kingdom) and the Strasbourg court has proved to be beneficial to the
development of human rights law in this jurisdiction - and, I hope, in
Strasbourg. Accordingly, if it appears to us that the narrower approach is even
only probably correct, the fact that the Strasbourg court has consistently
taken a different view should not necessarily stand in the way of our coming to
a contrary conclusion. In this case, the notion that we can take such a course
can fairly be said to be supported by the fact that, although it is
inconsistent with the views expressed in a number of decisions of the
Strasbourg court, the notion that the narrower approach is correct has not, so
far as I can see, been specifically raised in that court. But there must be a
good reason for our taking such a course, and in this case, at least in my view,
there is not.</span></a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, in my view, there are good reasons for favouring the wider
approach. First, one starts with the proposition that, given that it is rightly
accepted on all sides that the authorities have an investigatory duty, it would
be of little value unless it was a duty to investigate effectively. Provided
that courts bear clearly in mind “the difficulties involved in policing modern
societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices
which must be made in terms of priorities and resources” and the need to
interpret the duty “in a way which does not impose an impossible or
disproportionate burden on the authorities” (<i>Osman v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/101.html">(1998) 29 EHRR 245</a>, para 116), I find it hard to understand why an investigation which
is seriously defective in purely operational terms should, in effect, be held
to satisfy the investigatory duty.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93">93.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, I cannot see any basis in its jurisprudence to suggest that it
is likely that the Strasbourg court would think it right to limit the extent of
the investigatory duty to systemic, as opposed to operational, failures. It is
true that in <i>A v United Kingdom</i> (1998) 27 EHRR 611, having held that
article 3, together with article 1, “requires States to take measures designed
to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to
torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”, the court concluded
that then-current statutory provisions “did not provide adequate protection to
the applicant against treatment or punishment contrary to article 3” and that
“the failure to provide adequate protection constitutes a violation of article
3” (paras 21 and 24). However, that conclusion merely reflected the factual
basis and arguments in the case. If the statute did not provide adequate
protection, there was a systemic failure, and it was both unnecessary and
pointless to consider the operational aspects of the legal system. However,
clearly to my mind, it does not follow that, if the statutory provisions had
complied with article 3, but the legal processes had been defective, the United
Kingdom would have been acquitted of infringing article 3. Indeed, the court’s
summary of the law in <i>A v United Kingdom</i>, para 22 contains nothing to
suggest that the state’s obligation there being discussed should be limited to
systemic matters.</a></p><a name="para93">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, while the court in <i>Osman</i>, para 116, was concerned to
ensure that the investigatory duty was not interpreted or applied
unrealistically, there is no indication in that paragraph that it was intending
to limit the duty to the provision of a satisfactory framework, irrespective of
how ineptly it operated in a particular case. Indeed, such an approach would
seem to me to be inconsistent with how the Strasbourg court approaches cases
generally, namely by reference to the specific facts of the particular case.</a></p><a name="para94">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94"></a><a name="para95">95.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, there are forensic considerations. In that connection, I would
start by rejecting the notion that it could be right for a court to dismiss a
claim that an investigation was seriously defective simply because the relevant
police procedures as set out in official documents were satisfactory. It would
not merely be formalistic, but both unjust and unrealistic, to hold that an
investigation, which was seriously systematically defective in practice,
nonetheless complied with the article 3 investigatory duty simply on the
grounds that, while the systemic defects occurred in practice, they did not
reflect the systems as laid down officially. Whether the wider or the narrower
approach is correct, the court must surely consider the real, not the
hypothetical.</a></p><a name="para95">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once that is accepted, I consider that the narrower approach could
present a court with difficult practical, categorisation, and apportionment
issues. Whichever approach applies, a court must inevitably start by
considering the failures in the particular case. On the wider approach, the
court would simply ask whether those failures were sufficiently serious to
represent an infringement of the investigatory duty. On the other hand, on the
narrower approach, the court would have to consider which of the failures were
operational and which were systemic, and that, as I see it, is where problems
would often start. Serious operational failures by individual officers would
frequently throw up arguable systemic issues, such as systems of supervision or
even of appointment of those officers. And, in order to decide whether the
operational failures were systemic in origin, the court might often have to
embark on an inquiry whether, for instance, the failures were redolent of what
happened in other investigations. That could involve a potentially
time-consuming and expensive inquiry into other investigations, as well as
arguments as to the number and types of investigation, if any, to which the
inquiry should be restricted. The question whether the defective investigation
was attributable to systemic, rather than purely operational, failures could
also involve difficult issues of categorisation and inference. For instance, in
many cases it may be hard to decide whether a particular failure is operational
or systemic, or whether the operational failures in an investigation or a set
of investigations entitle the court to infer a systemic failure. And what
happens if, as may very often be the case, there are some operational failures
which are purely operational and some which are attributable to structural
failures?</a></p><a name="para96">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not consider that my view is undermined by the reasoning expressed
or conclusions reached in <i>Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police</i>
[1989] 1 AC 53, <i>Brooks v Comr for the Police for the Metropolis</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/24.html">[2005] 1 WLR 1495</a>, <i>Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police; Smith v Chief
Constable of Sussex Police</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/50.html">[2009] AC 225</a> and <i>Michael v Chief Constable
of South Wales Police</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] AC 1732</a>. Those cases establish that, absent
special factors, our domestic law adopts the view that, when investigating
crime, the police owe no duty of care in tort to individual citizens. That is
because courts in this country consider that the imposition of such a duty
would, as Lord Hughes puts it, “inhibit the robust operation of police work,
and divert resources from current inquiries; it would be detrimental, not a
spur, to law enforcement”. That view is entirely defensible, but, at least in
the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, so is the opposite view that
the imposition of such a duty, provided that it is realistically interpreted
and applied, would serve to enhance the effectiveness of police operations. It
is therefore understandable that human rights law, with its investigatory duty
under article 2 and 3, differs from domestic tort law in holding that it is
right to impose an investigatory duty on the police. Just as the majority of
this Court accepted in <i>Michael</i>, at paras 123-128, that the domestic
tortious test for liability should not be widened to achieve consistency with
the human rights test, so should the human rights test for liability not be
narrowed to achieve consistency with the domestic, tortious test.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I turn to an argument which I have already touched on, namely that
the wider interpretation involves placing too great a burden on public
authorities, in particular on the police. This concern was recognised in
relation to the similar article 2 obligation on the police in <i>Osman v United
Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/101.html">(1998) 29 EHRR 245</a>, para 116, where, as I have mentioned, the
Strasbourg court said that the “obligation must be interpreted in a way which
does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities”
(and see to the same effect <i>CN v United Kingdom </i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1911.html">56 EHRR 24</a>, para
68). The point was developed in <i>MC v Bulgaria</i>, where at para 168, the
Strasbourg court made it clear that, when considering whether an investigation
had satisfied article 2, a court should not be “concerned with allegations of
errors or isolated omissions in the investigation”. As the Grand Chamber said
in <a name="To"></a><span class="s7d2086b4"><i>Tunç v Turkey</i></span>, para 176,
“<span class="sb8d990e2">the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the
minimum threshold of the investigation’s effectiveness depend on the
circumstances of the particular case”. The court in that case went on to find
“shortcomings” in the investigation, but held that there had been no
infringement of article 2, because they were not “serious” or “decisive” (paras
189 and 195), and it concluded in para 209 that there were “no such
shortcomings as might call into question the overall adequacy and promptness of
the investigation”. And in <i>Beganović v Croatia</i>, para 78, the
Strasbourg court emphasised that it should only conclude that the investigatory
duty had been infringed “in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity
of the act and the results obtained at domestic level” (citing the earlier
decisions of </span><a name="para78"><i>Nikolova and Velichkova v Bulgaria</i>,
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/1128.html">(2009) 48 EHRR 40</a>, para 62, and <i>Atalay v Turkey</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/850.html">[2008] ECHR 850</a>, para 40,
which are to the like effect). It is because of the concern expressed in <i>Osman</i>,
para 116, that it is important to emphasise that only “serious” defects in any
investigation can lead to the conclusion that there has been an infringement of
article 2 or article 3.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99">99.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, I conclude that a claim based on serious defects in the
performance of the investigatory duty under article 3 (and equally under
article 2) can succeed even if defects are all of a purely operational, as
opposed to a systemic, nature.</a></p><a name="para99">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The context in which this case comes to this court needs to be remarked.
It is unusual. The treatment under consideration is the very serious offence of
rape of victims who were exploited after putting themselves in apparently
trustworthy hands (a black cab driver) and who had then been rendered helpless
by stupefaction. There has been no dispute from the beginning that there were
notable general failings in the police approach to investigation into the kind
of complaint which both claimants made. They affected both the initial
complaint by DSD in 2003, at least from the time of the morning after the
event, at which stage she first realised that she had been sexually attacked,
and the later complaint by NBV in 2007. The findings recorded by the judge in a
meticulous judgment were almost entirely to the same effect as, and were
grounded upon, the police’s own conclusions, following detailed internal
reports, about the deficiencies of their approach to the possibility of drug
induced rape. The consequences were extremely serious. Because the first
incident reported was not approached properly, the attacker remained undetected
and became a serial rapist. Although only a small proportion (ten) of his many
attacks were reported to the police at the time, it is now known that he raped
more than 100 women, employing a similar method. His modus operandi was highly
specific. Once anyone put two or more of the reported incidents side by side, the
inference that there was a single serial offender was irresistible. Once that
was done, early in 2008, the rapist was arrested, and compelling evidence
against him found, within eight days. That could and should have been done
years earlier. Recognising the substantial justice of the complaints, the
police have made it clear that in the event that their appeal should be
successful, they do not seek repayment of the compensation ordered by the
judge. But the elementary justice of the complainants’ cases makes it all the
more important that the ambit of the duty should be considered. Otherwise
indignation at their experiences may lead to an over-wide formulation passing
unnoticed, with detrimental results for the criminal justice system.</a></p><a name="para102">

<p class="ParaHeading">The origin of the positive duties</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para102"></a><a name="para103">103.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 3 ECHR says this:</a></p><a name="para103">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“No one shall be subjected to
torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para103"></a><a name="para104">104.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is elementary that, as Laws LJ pointed out in the Court of Appeal in
the present case, the obligations created by the Convention lie upon the party
States and upon no one else. The Convention governs the relationship between
the State and the citizen. It creates no duties for individuals. Article 1 is
explicit. It is on the states that it imposes the obligation to “secure” to
those within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the
Convention. It is perfectly clear that the primary case of behaviour which is a
breach of article 3 is where torture or inhuman or degrading treatment is meted
out by the state against a person within its jurisdiction. Even without the
origins of the Convention in the aftermath of the Second World War, the very
use of the expressions “torture” and “inhuman or degrading treatment” is
sufficient demonstration of that; these are typically descriptions of State
misbehaviour. And the same is demonstrated by the words “subjected to”. If the
State inflicts such treatment, it has subjected the citizen to it. Anything
beyond that is a judicial gloss on the Convention, well established as that gloss
may now be. In fact, there have been developed two glosses. Similar glosses
have been applied to the primary obligation in article 2, concerning the right
to life, and it may be to other rights.</a></p><a name="para104">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para104"></a><a name="para105">105.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first gloss was explained by the Strasbourg court in <i>Assenov v
Bulgaria </i>(1998) 28 EHRR 652, in which there was an allegation of police
violence towards a suspect in custody. It builds on the primary obligation of
the state not itself to inflict prohibited treatment on the individual. If that
primary obligation stood alone, it might well be ineffective because the State
organ which inflicts such treatment may deny it or cover it up. It will be
effective only if, when there is a reason to think that such ill-treatment may
have been inflicted by a state organ, there is an ancillary “positive
obligation” to take steps to investigate the allegation and to bring to book
those who are found to be responsible. At para 102 the court set out the reason
for this obligation:</a></p><a name="para105">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The court considers that … where
an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated
by the police or other such agents of the State unlawfully and in breach of article
3, that provision, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under
article 1 of the Convention to ‘secure to everyone within their jurisdiction
the rights and freedoms in [the] Convention’, requires by implication that
there should be an effective official investigation. This obligation, as with
that under article 2, should be capable of leading to the identification and
punishment of those responsible. <b>If this were not the case, the general
legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and
punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in
practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to
abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity</b>.” (Emphasis
supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para105"></a><a name="para106">106.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same rationale was explained (in the context of the ancillary article
2 positive obligation to investigate State responsibility for death in custody)
by Lord Bingham in <i>R (Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/51.html">[2004] 1 AC 653</a>, para 31<span style="font-size:12.0pt">. The </span>purpose of the duty is, he said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“to ensure so far as possible that
the full facts are brought to light; that culpable and discreditable conduct is
exposed and brought to public notice; that suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing
(if unjustified) is allayed; that dangerous practices and procedures are
rectified; and that those who have lost their relative may at least have the
satisfaction of knowing that lessons learnt from his death may save the lives
of others.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The reference to culpable and discreditable conduct was
plainly to such conduct on the part of State organs. The nature of the
obligation was neatly summed up by Jackson J in <i>R (Wright)v Secretary of
State for the Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2001/520.html">[2001] EWHC Admin 520</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2001/520.html">[2001] UKHRR 1399</a>, in
terms repeated by Sedley LJ in <i>R (AM) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/219.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 219</a>: that an article 2 or article 3
investigation</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“is required in order to maximise
future compliance with those articles.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para107">107.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second gloss is different and is the one in question in the present
case. It concerns ill-treatment not by the state but by an individual or other
third party actor. Plainly a citizen may be subjected to inhuman or degrading
treatment (or torture) by a fellow citizen. It has become commonplace to speak
of this as a breach of article 3, but it is not. An individual cannot be in
breach of the Convention. In the ordinary way, if treatment falling within article
3 is applied by A to B, then A may have subjected B to it, but the state has
not. The State’s responsibility is simply not engaged. But it may be if, and
only if, the State fails to take steps to afford its protection to B against
A’s misbehaviour. In that event, it is still not a case of the state subjecting
the individual to inhuman or degrading treatment, but by judicial gloss the article
is read as carrying with it an unspoken but implicit “positive obligation” upon
the State to afford its protection.</a></p><a name="para107">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para107"></a><a name="para108">108.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This second gloss has the potential to extend considerably wider than
the first. Whilst the first is concerned to give effect to the primary
obligation of the state not itself to subject people to inhuman or degrading
treatment, the second reaches into the question of what the state is bound to
do in relation to the acts of people for whose behaviour it is not responsible.
When one comes to this question, there are considerations which do not apply to
the first gloss.</a></p><a name="para108">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para108"></a><a name="para109">109.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even in the most law-abiding of states, that sometimes serious harm will
be inflicted by one individual upon another, in the context of all manner of
disputes and in pursuit of many different objectives, is a regrettably
unavoidable feature of life. No one suggests that the state is bound to
guarantee that this will not happen. Indeed, some steps which an authoritarian
state might be inclined to take with a view to preventing it (such as
preventive detention without conviction or other court order, house arrest,
intensive surveillance and the like) might themselves be infringements of other
fundamental rights afforded to the citizen. That consideration apart, the
systems which states adopt for the protection of those within their boundaries
do not have to be the same. It has never been suggested that it is the function
of the Convention to monitor every act of enforcement or policing of the varied
domestic legal requirements, nor the content of those requirements, so long as
they provide sufficiently for the protection of the individual against third
party behaviour which meets the high threshold of severity contemplated by
article 3. Otherwise, what would be involved would not be a gloss on the
primary obligation imposed by article 3, nor would the “positive obligation” be
in any sense ancillary to that primary obligation. Rather, the duty would be of
a completely different character to the primary obligation, and would entail
wholesale assimilation of, and judicial control of, the legal systems of
independent states.</a></p><a name="para109">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para109"></a><a name="para110">110.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The positive obligation constituted by this second gloss - relating to
the protection of citizens from third party ill-treatment - requires first that
the state have a legal framework for the prohibition of conduct passing the article
3 threshold, and thus afford the protection of its legal system against such
behaviour. <i>A v United Kingdom</i> (1998) 27 EHRR 611 was an example of a
legal system which failed to provide sufficient protection to children against
the infliction of serious harm via corporal punishment, until the former
English defence of “reasonable chastisement” was altered. Such cases concern
the structure of a state’s system.</a></p><a name="para110">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110"></a><a name="para111">111.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The more difficult question is whether the implied positive obligation
recognised by the second gloss extends beyond the structure of the state’s
system to its operation in an individual case. The Strasbourg court confronted
this in <i>Osman v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/101.html">(1998) 29 EHRR 245</a>, where the complaint
was that the police force had failed sufficiently to heed reports suggesting
that an obsessive might be a danger to an individual, who had then been
attacked and almost killed (and his father killed). The context was the
equivalent gloss on article 2, but the principles are the same as for article
3. The court concluded that the implied positive obligation to protect could
apply but in narrow circumstances of “a real and immediate risk to the life of
an identified individual by a third party, of which risk the State either knew
or ought to have known”. If such an immediate threat exists, then the State’s
obligation is to do what can reasonably be expected of it which might reasonably
have avoided the risk; it is not limited to a duty to avoid gross negligence. As
Lord Bingham observed in <i>Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police;
Smith v Chief Constable of Sussex Police</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/50.html">[2008] UKHL 50</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/50.html">[2009] AC 225</a> at para
29, it is quite apparent that every ingredient of this carefully drafted test
is of importance. It defines the restricted circumstances in which a duty
arises under the Convention to take reasonable operational steps to forestall
known specific threats to the safety of an individual from eventuating.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para112">112.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court in <i>Osman</i> made clear the reason why this test is
restrictive. It lies in the realities of law enforcement and policing. At para
116 it said this:</a></p><a name="para112">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“For the Court, and bearing in
mind the difficulties of policing modern societies, the unpredictability of
human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of
priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which
does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.
Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a
Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from
materialising. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the
police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully
respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place
restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring
offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in articles 5 and 8 of
the Convention.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para112"></a><a name="para113">113.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This duty recognised in <i>Osman</i> is a duty to take reasonable steps
not to enforce the law or to punish a perpetrator, but to prevent serious
violence from occurring to an individual when the threat of it is sufficiently
specific. It is an expansion of the second gloss beyond the requirement for
structures and systems to render serious violence unlawful, but it is carefully
narrow in extent. The House of Lords faithfully applied <i>Osman</i> in <i>Van
Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police</i>.</a></p><a name="para113">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para113"></a><a name="para114">114.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What has happened since is that the second gloss has been further
extended beyond prevention of anticipated violent crime to a duty to
investigate reported past violence. The usually identified origin of this
further extension is <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/651.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 20</a>. There is no doubt
that the formulation adopted in that case has been often repeated, usually word
for word, in later cases. In that sense there is, no doubt, a consistent line
of authority. The difficulty is that much remains unclear, indeed unexplained. Unclear
remain the rationale for the extension, the issue whether it can be derived
from <i>Osman</i> and/or <i>Assenov </i>or if not why departure from the
principles of those cases is justified, and the extent of the duty as extended.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115">115.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>MC v Bulgaria</i> concerned a complaint of rape made by a 14 year old
against two young men of her acquaintance with whom she had spent an evening
and night travelling around in their car. They had been arrested on the day
that she made her complaint to the police, a few days after the alleged event. Their
case was that she had consented. There were multiple clashes of evidence
between the complainant on the one hand and those she accused, plus other
witnesses, on the other. But the prosecutors’ investigation had been closed on
the grounds that neither force (physical or psychological) nor threats of the
same, nor physical resistance by the complainant, had been established. The
point of the case was the court’s rejection of that criterion for rape, which
was at the time consistently adopted by the Bulgarian authorities, and was
asserted by the Government to be the rule: see paras 122 and 166. Thus there
was a breach of article 3 (and indeed of article 8) because the Bulgarian
structures or system for the criminalisation of rape did not sufficiently
protect an individual’s sexual autonomy; absence of consent must be the
criterion, rather than the use of force.</a></p><a name="para115">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115"></a><a name="para116">116.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That sufficiently demonstrated a breach of article 3 in the same way as
in <i>A v United Kingdom</i>. The court, however, went on to draw attention to
deficiencies in the prosecutors’ investigation of the complaint. At the outset
of its judgment it made the following statement of principle, which has
subsequently been adopted, often word for word, in later cases.</a></p><a name="para116">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“151.&nbsp; In a number of cases
article 3 of the Convention gives rise to a positive obligation to conduct an
official investigation. Such positive obligations cannot be considered in
principle to be limited solely to cases of ill-treatment by state agents.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the Court has not
excluded the possibilities that the state’s positive obligation under article 8

summary of the three propositions in paras 151 and 152. As to those, authority
is cited for each of them. The authority cited for the first sentence of 151 is
<i>Assenov</i> (at para 102). For the second sentence of 151 it is <i>Calvelli
and Ciglio v Italy</i>. For the third proposition, in 152, it is <i>Osman</i>
at para 128.</p>

</span>Whilst these paragraphs show that the court asserts that article 3
carries an obligation in some circumstances to investigate third party
offending, they leave only uncertainties about its source and thus its extent.</a></p><a name="para117">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As has been seen, <i>Assenov</i> does indeed show that article 3 gives
rise to a positive obligation “in a number of cases” to conduct an official
investigation. But those cases are ones where the investigation is into
suspected state involvement in ill-treatment and is necessary if the primary
obligation on the State is not to be ineffective. That rationale does not apply
to cases of third party offending and <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> does not say
anything about the difference between the two situations. Given the explanation
in <i>Assenov</i> of the reasons why an ancillary positive obligation has been
devised by judicial gloss, the difference is fundamental.</a></p><a name="para118">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Calvelli and Ciglio</i> was a case of alleged medical negligence in
the course of the delivery of a baby who died shortly afterwards. It had been
treated by the Italian authorities as a case of possible criminal manslaughter.
The doctor had been convicted but his conviction was eventually set aside by
the Court of Cassation on the grounds that he had wrongly been convicted in his
absence. A re-trial was ordered but by then the limitation period had expired.
The claimants asserted that there had been no effective system of investigation
and trial because owing to delays the limitation period had expired and the
doctor had not been convicted. The Court held that there had been no violation
of article 2. The obligation discussed was the duty to run a system which
provided sufficient remedies: see paras 49-54. That is the <i>A v United Kingdom</i>
duty. There had been no breach of it because in the field of medical negligence
a civil rather than a criminal process can suffice and here there had been
sufficient remedies in (1) a right to damages (which had been pursued and then
settled by the claimants without a finding of liability against the doctor,
thus waiving an entitlement to pursue the case to such a finding) and (2) disciplinary
regulation of doctors. True, there was complaint of delay made, but there was
no examination in this case of the question what duty existed to investigate
the doctor’s actions. The nearest that the court got to that question was the
observation that remedies must be effective and not exist in theory only. It is
not easy to see how this case generated the second sentence of para 151 in <i>MC
v Bulgaria</i>, but if it did it is more consistent with an obligation to
provide a sufficient investigative structure than with a duty not to be
negligent in the detailed inquiry.</a></p><a name="para119">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to para 152 of <i>MC v Bulgaria</i>, para 128 of <i>Osman</i> (a) is
concerned with whether there had been a breach of article 8 and (b) simply
re-states the finding that the police did not know, nor ought to have known, of
a real and immediate threat to the safety of the complainant. Of course it is
true that in order to establish whether a sufficiently real and immediate
threat to the safety of the complainant exists, it will in some cases be
necessary for the police to investigate the complaint. But that does not alter
the fact that the carefully limited duty recognised in <i>Osman</i> is concerned
not with an obligation to investigate a past event, but with an obligation to
prevent a future one.</a></p><a name="para120">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The tentative tone of para 152 is also to be noted. No more is said than
that the possibility of the positive obligation extending to a duty to mount an
effective investigation is “not excluded”. No further reasoning is shown for
the progression from that to the much more positive statement in para 153. It
is not clear why that more positive statement follows from the previous two
paragraphs, even if those two had been themselves firmly grounded on the
authority cited.</a></p><a name="para121">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court in <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> was moreover at pains to set some
limit to the permissible review of the investigation. At paras 167-168 it said
this:</a></p><a name="para122">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“167.&nbsp; In the light of the above,
the court’s task is to examine whether or not the impugned legislation and
practice and its application in the case at hand, combined with the alleged
shortcomings in the investigation, had such significant flaws as to amount to a
breach of the respondent state’s positive obligations under articles 3 and 8 of
the Convention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">168.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue before the court
is limited to the above. The court is not concerned with allegations of errors
or isolated omissions in the investigation; it cannot replace the domestic
authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case; nor can it decide on
the alleged perpetrators’ criminal responsibility.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para122"></a><a name="para123">123.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court identified, at para 177, deficiencies in the investigation. It
concluded that the conflicting assertions were not sufficiently sensitively
assessed, and that inquiries which could have been made into timings, which
might have shown which version was correct, were not made. It also criticised
the fact that the complainant had not had the opportunity to confront and
question the witnesses relied upon by the accused. Lastly, the investigators
had not, it was said, sufficiently taken into account the unlikelihood that a 14
year old would make advances to the second man only minutes after losing her virginity
to the first. But at para 179, set out by Lord Kerr at para 25 above, the court
made it clear that it regarded the deficiencies in the investigation as the
consequence of, and part and parcel with, the flawed approach of the Bulgarian
system generally to the issue of lack of consent. It was because of the
criterion of force/resistance that the investigation did not go into matters
which otherwise it should have done. This must be the explanation for the
observations about investigation, for otherwise it is very difficult to see
that the criticisms made could found a breach of article 3 given the words of
paras 167 and 168. Those paragraphs make it clear that the gloss on article 3
is not a vehicle for the second-guessing via the Convention of the ordinary
domestic process of assessment of conflicting evidence. Of course it is true
that the Strasbourg court is a supra-national one, but there is no sign that
the limit on concern with “errors or isolated omissions” is restricted to that
court as distinct from a national court when the latter is applying the
Convention; on the contrary, the limit is expressed to be one which determines
when there is a breach of article 3 and this plainly is the same for all courts
examining that question. Nor can it be the case that a system which does not
involve pre-trial confrontation of witnesses, as some Code Napoleon systems do,
but other systems, including all the United Kingdom ones, do not, is ipso facto
in breach of article 3.</a></p><a name="para123">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What has happened since <i>MC v Bulgaria</i> is that the formulation
cited above has been repeated, or in some cases summarised. It is plain that in
several of them the summary has been to the effect that whenever there is an
allegation of ill-treatment passing the article 3 threshold, by whomever committed,
there is an obligation on the state to conduct “an effective investigation”.</a></p><a name="para124">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para124"></a><a name="para125">125.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But in none of these cases has the basis for, and thus the ambit of, any
obligation to investigate third party violence ever been addressed. Reference
back to <i>MC v Bulgaria</i>, and to its reliance on <i>Assenov, Calvelli</i>
and <i>Osman</i> is frequently made, but never examined and the uncertainties
mentioned above have not been confronted. In some cases, there is additional
reliance on a series of Turkish cases: <i>Ay</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/167.html">[2005] ECHR 167</a>, <i>Ali &amp;
Aysu Duran </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/289.html">[2008] ECHR 289</a>, <i>Mehmet </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/269.html">[2008] ECHR 269</a>, <i>Celik</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2004/548.html">[2004] ECHR 548</a> and <i>Bati </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2004/246.html">[2008] ECHR 246</a>. But all of these were cases of
allegations of serious police torture or ill-treatment of suspects; the
citation of such cases illustrates the manner in which the difference between
the first gloss and the second has not received attention.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para126">126.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In most cases the injunction that the court is not concerned with errors
or isolated omissions is similarly repeated. In some, the court appears to have
looked accordingly for evidence of a structural defect, alternatively “culpable
disregard” or an absence of good faith, in the administration of the domestic
system: see for example <i>Szula v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/86.html">(2007) 44 EHRR SE19</a> and <i>BV
v Croatia </i>(Application No 38435/13) 21 January 2016. But this is not always
the case. The injunction notwithstanding, in some of the cases the criticisms
of the investigation have been very particular. In some, there are plain
overtones of structural State deficiencies in relation to the investigation of
allegations of racially motivated or discriminatory violence: examples include <i>Secic
v Croatia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/1159.html">(2009) 49 EHRR 18</a>, <i>Beganović v Croatia </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/992.html">[2009] ECHR 992</a><i>, </i>and <i>Milanovic v Serbia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/2029.html">[2010] ECHR 2029</a>, but this was not
given as a reason for the decisions. In others, such as <i>Vasilyev v Russia </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/2078.html">[2009] ECHR 2078</a>, the nub of the allegation was serious misbehaviour by the police, in
that case by dumping the injured men in the street in the aftermath of a third
party assault. But in some, the court has found itself simply pronouncing on
whether the investigation was sufficiently careful. An example appears to be <i>CAS
v Romania</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/512.html">(2015) 61 EHRR 18</a>, where the complaint was of sexual abuse of a
boy in his home by a visitor or neighbour. It is possible that the basis of the
decision was a conclusion that, as in some other cases, the state did not take
allegations of sexual abuse seriously enough, but that is not said. The court
found a breach of article 3 not only in delay, which did not prevent the
prosecution of the specific individual identified, but also in what it
described as a failure sufficiently to evaluate conflicting testimony,
supported by the fact that when that individual accused was acquitted, the
police did not look for anyone else. That is very close to, if not
indistinguishable from, a view that the outcome of the trial was wrong, and
moreover that if it was wrong that could itself amount to a breach of article
3. <i>Beganović</i> is another case in which (at para 77) the court
appears to have held that the positive obligation under article 3 may extend
into examination of the conduct of the trial. Such instances, which may be
atypical, leave unanswered the question what is meant by the principle that a
breach of article 3 is not constituted by a bona fide decision in the course of
investigation or law enforcement which is afterwards held to have been an
error.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para127">127.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Occasionally in the Strasbourg cases, the general statement of
principles includes the seminal passage from <i>Osman v United Kingdom</i>
(para 116) which is set out at para 112 above. In most of them it does not. But
it is surely clear that these considerations relating to the practical business
of policing, to the operational choices which have to be made as to priorities
and to the allocation of finite resources, must apply with equal if not greater
force to the investigation of allegations of past third party violence as they
do to reports of threats of future violence. These considerations point firmly
to the proper test for the ancillary positive obligation under article 3 to
investigate reports of past violence being whether the state has a proper
structure of legal and policing provision designed to punish it when it occurs
and has administered that structure in good faith and with proper regard for the
gravity of the behaviour under consideration. They do not point towards a test
of ex post facto assessment of whether the investigation was careless or made
mistakes which ought not to have been made, nor to a finding that there has
been a breach of the right not to suffer torture, or inhuman or degrading
treatment, when the complaint is that an investigation could and should have
been done better.</a></p><a name="para127">

<p class="ParaHeading">The threshold of behaviour</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para127"></a><a name="para128">128.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is the more so when one considers the range of behaviour which is
treated as triggering the ancillary positive obligation under article 3. It is
clear, and regularly emphasised, that treatment must pass “a minimum of
severity” before it falls within article 3. It is also clear, and routinely
stated, that what that minimum amounts to is relative and varies according to
the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the
punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration, its physical
and mental effects, and in some instances the sex age and state of health of
the victim. That statement derives from an early corporal punishment case, <i>Costello-Roberts
v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/16.html">(1995) 19 EHRR 112</a>, para 30. It was repeated in <i>A v United
Kingdom </i>at para 20 and in many subsequent judgments. It is no doubt plain
that in the case involving breach of the state’s primary obligation not to
inflict inhuman or degrading treatment on its citizens, almost any physical
injury perpetrated upon a citizen by a State official, typically the police,
will cross the article 3 threshold. Save where necessary in the course of
resisted arrest or the prevention of crime, there is simply no place in
policing for causing injury of any kind to a suspect. The practice of the
Strasbourg court in relation to third party violence might have built upon the
relative nature of the threshold in order to limit the ancillary positive
obligation to very serious violence but it has not done so. In <i>Milanovic v
Serbia</i> numerous cuts combined with feelings of fear and helplessness were
regarded (at para 87) as triggering the ancillary positive obligation. In <i>BV
v Croatia </i>(at paras 153 and 121) injuries to the head and contusions to the
body were treated likewise. It is plain from the cases that the threshold is
regarded as falling, in English terms, somewhere on the scale of actual bodily
harm. To that must be added rape and child sexual abuse; whether indecent
assault passes the threshold remains unclear but it is perhaps likely that it
may. So also one would think must be added false imprisonment (for example by
relatives), violent disorder, most terrorist offences and many other crimes. It
follows that the great majority of violent and sexual offences will trigger the
ancillary positive obligation, and that potentially the investigation of all
such offences might lead to an action under section 6 of the Human Rights Act,
querying the adequacy of the police treatment of the case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para129">129.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might also be noted that the application of the judicial glosses to
the other rights protected by the Convention has not, as yet, received detailed
consideration. But it is difficult to see why, if they are sound, they may not
in principle be applied equally to other rights. In <i>Siliadin v France </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/545.html">[2005] ECHR 545</a> the Court held that the second gloss applied to article 4 at least as
far as the obligation to put in place legal prohibition of forced labour was
concerned, but an obligation in relation to investigation was not in issue. Some
third party behaviour in relation to modern slavery might indeed be
considerably more serious than actual bodily harm in a fight outside a club. Some
of the cases clearly contemplate that third party infringement of article 8
rights may trigger the ancillary positive obligation: see in <i>CAS v Romania</i>
at para 72<i>, </i>and <i>Szula v United Kingdom </i>at para 1. The possible
application of that ancillary positive obligation to third party interference
with the right to enjoyment of one’s possessions under Article 1 Protocol 1 has
yet, it seems, to be considered. But in principle, the state has a duty to
protect this right in its citizens, as it has in relation to all the other
rights under the Convention. If so, the prospect may exist of the response to
every complaint of burglary, car theft or fraud becoming the subject of an action
under the Human Rights Act.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">English domestic law and its relevance</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para130">130.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>English law recognises a public legal duty owed by the police to enforce
the law. The police enjoy a wide measure of discretion as to how to go about
it, what inquiries to make, and when and whom to prosecute, but a structural
failure to enforce a particular part of the law is amenable to direction by the
court via judicial review on the application of any interested party: <i>R v
Comr of Police of the Metropolis, Ex p Blackburn</i> [1968] 2 QB 118. Such a
public duty is real, not abstract. That is consistent with the implied positive
obligation recognised by the Strasbourg court in cases such as <i>A v United Kingdom.</i>
English law also recognises the liability of the police to individuals where a
tortious duty of care is broken, as it may be where they have directly or
indirectly occasioned physical harm: <i>Knightley v Johns </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/6.html">[1982] 1 WLR 349</a>
is a simple example. Further, it has a statutory scheme for the independent
investigation of complaints about the police, and a different statutory scheme
for the compensation of citizens who are injured through the criminal acts of
others. What English law does not recognise is a duty of care in tort owed by
the police to individual citizens and sounding in damages in relation to the
detection of crime and the enforcement of the law.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para131">131.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reasons for this absence of private law duty of care were fully
explained by the House of Lords in <i>Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire
Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/12.html">[1989] AC 53</a>, and confirmed by that court in <i>Brooks v Comr for
the Police of the Metropolis</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/24.html">[2005] 1 WLR 1495</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/24.html">[2005] UKHL 24</a> and in <i>Van

<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] AC 1732</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] UKSC 2</a>. They find convincing expression in the first
three cases in the separate speeches of Lords Keith, Steyn, Hope, Phillips,
Carswell and Brown and were supported also by Lord Bingham despite his solitary
dissent on the extent of the particular duty (of prevention) under
consideration in <i>Smith</i>. A convenient summary is perhaps afforded by the
judgment of Lord Phillips in <i>Smith</i> at para 97:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not find it possible to
approach <i>Hill </i>and <i>Brooks </i>as cases that turned on their own facts.
The fact that Lord Steyn applied the decision in <i>Hill </i>to the facts of <i>Brooks,
</i>which were so very different, underlines the fact that Lord Steyn was
indeed applying a ‘core principle’ that had been ‘unchallenged … for many
years’. That principle is, so it seems to me, that in the absence of special
circumstances the police owe no common law duty of care to protect individuals
against harm caused by criminals. The two relevant justifications advanced for
the principle are (i) that a private law duty of care in relation to
individuals would be calculated to distort, by encouraging defensive action,
the manner in which the police would otherwise deploy their limited resources;
(ii) resources would be diverted from the performance of the public duties of
the police in order to deal with claims advanced for alleged breaches of
private law duties owed to individuals.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As Lord Hope explained in the same case at para 75:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The point that he [Lord Steyn] was
making in <i>Brooks</i>, in support of the core principle in <i>Hill</i>, was
that the principle had been enunciated in the interests of the whole community.
Replacing it with a legal principle which focuses on the facts of each case
would amount, in Lord Steyn’s words, to a retreat from the core principle. We
must be careful not to allow ourselves to be persuaded by the shortcomings of
the police in individual cases to undermine that principle. That was the very
thing that he was warning against, because of the risks that this would give
rise to. As Ward LJ said in <i>Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police
Force</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1322.html">[1997] QB 464</a>, 487, the greater public good outweighs any individual
hardship.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para132">132.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These reasons are powerful, repeated and carefully considered. They are
grounded in public policy and have something in common with the considerations
explained by the Strasbourg court in <i>Osman v United Kingdom</i> at para 116
(see above at para 112). In the briefest of terms, law enforcement and the
investigation of alleged crime involve a complex series of judgments and
discretionary decisions. They concern, amongst many other things, the choice of
lines of inquiry, the weighing of evidence thus far assembled and the
allocation of limited resources as between competing claims. To re-visit such
matters step by step by way of litigation with a view to private compensation
would inhibit the robust operation of police work, and divert resources from
current inquiries; it would be detrimental to, not a spur to, law enforcement.
It is not carrying out the impugned investigation efficiently which is likely
to lead to diversion of resources; on the contrary. It is the re-investigation
of past investigations in response to litigation which is likely to do so. Moreover,
whilst there may exist a mechanism by way of summary judgment for stopping
short such a re-investigation if the litigation be “spurious” in the sense of
demonstrably bad on the papers, other claims, and particularly those which turn
out to be speculative, cannot thus be halted. In short, the public duty would
be inhibited by a private duty of such a kind. A contemporary example can be
seen in terrorist activity. It is well known that large numbers of possible
activists are, to some extent or other, known to the police or security
services. The most delicate and difficult decisions have to be made about whom
to concentrate upon, whose movements to watch, who to make the subject of
potentially intrusive surveillance and so on. It is in no sense in the public
interest that, if a terrorist attack should unfortunately occur, litigation
should become the forum for a review of the information held about different
suspects and of the decisions made as to how they were to be dealt with. Nor is
it difficult to see that it is by no means necessarily in the public interest
that there should be pressure on the authorities, via the prospect of
litigation, to ratchet up the surveillance of additional persons. The
long-standing controversy over police use of powers of “stop and search”, for
instance in relation to the carrying of knives by youths, affords another
example.</a></p><a name="para132">

</span>It may be noted that in his separate opinion on <i>Osman</i> in the
commission, Sir Nicholas Bratza recognised the force of these considerations:
(1998) 29 EHRR at 298. As he pointed out, the difficulties highlighted by the
House of Lords in <i>Hill</i> were well illustrated by the facts of <i>Osman</i>.
The allegations there made by the claimant would, he said, involve an
investigation not only into issues of fact but into acutely difficult questions
of policy and discretion.</a></p><a name="para133">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The relevance of the position at which English law has arrived, after
long consideration at the highest level, is not that English law can control
the operation of the ECHR. But it is to highlight the delicate balance between
the duty of the State to the public generally and its relationship to
individuals in particular cases of reported or anticipated crime. That delicate
balance is as applicable to the ambit of the implied ancillary positive
obligation under articles 2, 3 and maybe others as it is to an action in tort
in the domestic courts. When taken together with the uncertainties as to the
nature and extent of the implied positive obligation as found by the second
gloss on those articles, it points clearly to the undesirability of any
assertion of a detailed review of the course of a particular criminal investigation
by way of the Convention. It is one thing to say that a state must take
seriously its protective obligation, must put in place structures which enforce
the law and must not then ignore them. It is quite another to say that by way
of the Convention every police investigation should be examined in detail to
see whether it should have been done better, and that compensation should be
paid out of the limited police resources, at the expense of other necessary
expenditure on current cases, if the decision is that it should have been. These
important public considerations have nowhere been examined or put into the
balance in any of the Strasbourg cases on the second gloss, from <i>MC v
Bulgaria</i> onwards.</a></p><a name="para134">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It can properly be said that the distinction between structural and
operational defects may at times be difficult to make. It is, however, no more
difficult than the distinction which it is suggested must be made, if
operational negligence suffices, between errors which amount to breaches of article
3 and those which do not. To say that the errors must be serious and
significant in order to amount to a breach of article 3 is surely more to
present than to solve the difficulty. Nor is such a restriction clearly to be
found anywhere in the line of Strasbourg cases relied upon. If the test is not
to be simply a falling below the standard to be expected of the police, and
thus the same as negligence, it is not easy to see what it is.</a></p><a name="para135">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The English cases make a clear distinction between the objectives served
by a tortious duty to compensate and a Convention-based duty to uphold the
prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment: see for example Lord Brown in <i>Van
Colle</i> at para 138. In substance, the Convention-based duty is not aimed at
compensation but at upholding and vindicating minimum human rights standards.
It is, substantially, to insist on performance of a public duty. It is now said
that this distinction justifies the acceptance of a general duty under article
3 to investigate any report of past behaviour passing the threshold of that article,
because such will not impinge on the common law position as firmly established
in the cases beginning with <i>Hill</i>. The error in this argument is to seek
to have it both ways. One cannot both uphold the distinction and effectively
eliminate it by employing a Convention claim to serve substantially the same
purpose as an action in tort. That it will do if the wide ambit of the ancillary
article 3 duty is accepted, and if compensation routinely follows a finding
that a criminal investigation should have been better conducted. True it is
that the limitation period differs, but this will not remove the disadvantages
to policing which were identified in the English cases. It may be that there is
a more relaxed approach to causation in a Convention-based claim, but that if
anything only increases the prospect of such a claim becoming a substitute for
a claim in tort. There is no doubt some difference of approach to the
calculation of compensation, but the present case is a good illustration of the
marginal, if not imperceptible, nature of the distinction in outcome - see the
judge’s scrupulous quantum judgment at paras 33, 130 and 143. If, on the other
hand, the positive duty under article 3 is recognised to conform to the public
duty, to put in place structures to outlaw the prohibited behaviour and to
operate them in good faith, the Convention-based claim will afford the
possibility of some compensation where the English common law rules do not, but
will not result in wholesale substitution of the Convention for a duty in tort.</a></p><a name="para136">

<p class="ParaHeading">The claimants’ argument</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the claimants Ms Kaufmann QC mounts an elegant argument. It is that
the positive obligation to investigate past third party crime for which she
contends is simply analogous to the <i>Osman</i> duty to protect from
threatened violent crime. Just as the latter arises when there is a real and
immediate risk of prescribed behaviour, so she contends the former arises when
there is a credible report that the prescribed behaviour has already occurred.</a></p><a name="para137">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para137"></a><a name="para138">138.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Elegant as the argument is, the two situations are not analogous. There
is a clear distinction between protection from an immediately anticipated
danger and inquiry into a past event. The carefully limited <i>Osman</i> duty
arises because there is an immediate risk of death or serious injury to an
identified individual, communicated to the State. By contrast, a crime of
violence committed by A against B will only occasionally carry a risk of
repetition, whether against B or against others; there is generally no
immediate danger to an identified person.</a></p><a name="para138">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is no doubt possible to categorise the duty to investigate reports of
third party crime as deriving from the state’s duty to protect its citizens, in
the same way as does its duty to have in place structures which make such
behaviour unlawful. So viewed, the duty to investigate each reported crime can
be said to be an application of cases such as <i>A v United Kingdom</i>. But
the reality is that there is a marked and vital distinction, even if it is
sometimes of degree, between structural failure to outlaw the behaviour and
operational failings in the investigation of particular reports.</a></p><a name="para139">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge’s findings as to what went wrong are not disputed, and were in
any event largely based on the very critical internal police reports, as well
as on that of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. What went wrong involved
plain structural errors. The Metropolitan Police had a written policy for
recognising and dealing with cases of drug induced rape but it was
institutionally treated as mere form and there was no proper training in its
application. The complaints made by the claimants were simply not accorded the
kind of weight which they demanded because of generic failures to treat them
with sufficient care and gravity. Moreover there was pressure internally to
write off cases of the kind here encountered. The various detailed failings in
the conduct of the inquiry were largely attributable to this flawed structural
approach. They included those set out by Lord Kerr at para 51. There is, as
explained at the outset, no appeal as to quantum. In those circumstances, this
is a case which falls within the ancillary positive duty under article 3, as it
ought to be interpreted. It is for that reason that I agree that the appeal in
the present case ought to be dismissed.</a></p><a name="para140">

</span>I have read with benefit the three judgments prepared in this case by
Lord Kerr, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hughes. The result is not in doubt, but
there is a significant difference between Lord Kerr and Lord Neuberger on the
one hand and Lord Hughes on the other regarding the extent to which the
Convention rights, as domesticated by the Human Rights Act 1998, should be seen
as imposing on the State an operational duty to investigate serious offences
the commission of which there is no reason to attribute to State agents. If
there is such a duty, then I do not see that it can or should be confined to
the victim of the offence in question. Part of its purpose must be not only to
punish, but also to deter and to prevent the occurrence of further such
offences, and, if a third person suffers foreseeably as a result of a failure
properly to investigate, that third person appears to me, potentially at least,
to be a victim.</a></p><a name="para141">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is much force in Lord Hughes’ analysis and critique in relation to
the question whether any such general duty exists. What has happened in the
Strasbourg jurisprudence is, unfortunately, not unprecedented. The European
Court of Human Rights starts from a solidly rationalised principle, but then
extends it to situations to which the rationale does not apply, without overt
recognition of the extension, without formulating any fresh rationale and
relying on supposed authority which does not actually support the extension.
Further, the European Court of Human Rights has not in the present context
really focused at any stage on the implications for policing of the general duty
which it has suggested. These have been discussed domestically in a number of
common law cases, and include the risks of defensive policing and of police
priorities being affected by the perceived risk of being sued, as well as the
significant financial implications of exposing the police to all those
potentially affected by any failure in police investigative work: see eg <i>Michael
v Chief Constable of South Wales Police </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] UKSC 2</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] AC 1732</a>,

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances, while appreciating the pressures under which the
European Court of Human Rights operates, and the difficulties of maintaining
coherence and discipline in a court consisting in the first instance of
multiple chambers, an approach, careful to identify, rationalise and justify
any significant development of principle, would save domestic litigants and
courts time, effort and expense.</a></p><a name="para143">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point is the positive duty on the State under article 3 not
to subject anyone “to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.
One (solidly rationalised) principle which the Court has derived from that
duty, by way of gloss, is an ancillary positive duty to conduct “an effective
official investigation” where “an individual raises an arguable case that he
has been seriously ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the State
unlawfully and in breach of article 3”: <i>Assenov v Bulgaria </i>(1998) 28
EHRR 652, para 102; the basis for this being that:</a></p><a name="para144">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If this were not the case, the
general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and
punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in
practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the state to
abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is a coherent gloss, derived from the rationale of article 3. It
was repeated in <i>Sevtap Veznedaroglou v Turkey </i>(Application No 32357/96),
para 32, cited in <i>Jacobs, While and Overy’s The European Convention on Human
Rights </i>(OUP, 2014) where this rationalisation is cited as the basis of any
positive investigative duty. The Supreme Court in <i>R (Smith) v Oxfordshire
Assistant Deputy Coroner </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/29.html">[2010] UKSC 29</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/29.html">[2011] 1 AC 1</a>, expressed a similar
understanding of the parallel ancillary investigative duty capable of arising
under article 2 (providing that “Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by
law”): “the investigative obligation under article 2 arose only in
circumstances where there was ground for suspicion that the state might have
breached a substantive obligation under article 2”, and “the death of a soldier
on active service did not of itself raise a presumption of such a breach”: see
headnote, holding (2). At paras 200-212, I examined both the Strasbourg and the
domestic jurisprudence on this point, including the analysis of the point by
the House of Lords in the prior authority of <i>R (Middleton) v West Somerset
Coroner </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/10.html">[2004] 2 AC 182</a>, para 3 per Lord Bingham, and <i>R (Gentle) v Prime
Minister </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/20.html">[2008] AC 1356</a>, para 6, per Lord Bingham. The investigative duty
was in short parasitic.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146">146.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 210, I examined the various specific situations in which the
European Court of Human Rights had held that there was sufficient State
involvement to give rise to a substantive obligation to protect, combined with
a parasitic duty to investigate after the event: killings by State agents and
deaths of persons in custody or mental health detainees, deaths of conscripts,
as well as situations where under the principle in <i>Osman v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1998/101.html">(1998) 29 EHRR 245</a>, the State was on notice of a specific and immediate threat to
someone’s life and bound accordingly to take protective steps.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147">147.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 211, I pointed out the distinction between the procedural
investigative obligation arising in such circumstances and “the general substantive
obligation under article 2 to establish an appropriate regulatory,
investigatory and judicial system”.</a></p><a name="para147">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147"></a><a name="para148">148.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To my mind, Lord Hughes’ analysis fits perfectly with what the House and
the Supreme Court then understood to be the law under article 2, and I believe
would also have thought the law to be under article 3, since there is no reason
to differentiate in this respect between them. The case of <i>MC v Bulgaria</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/651.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 20</a> was not even cited in <i>R (Smith)</i> and there is reason to
believe that its potential significance under these articles was not
appreciated until much more recently: see paras 149 and 150 below.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para149">149.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is at this point that the European Court of Human Rights extended a
solidly rationalised principle to situations to which the rationale did not
apply. What it did in<i> MC v Bulgaria </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/651.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 20</a>, para 151, was to
cite <i>Assenov, </i>para 102, in support of propositions that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In a number of cases article 3 of
the Convention gives rise to a positive obligation to conduct an official
investigation. Such positive obligations cannot be considered in principle to
be limited solely to cases of ill-treatment by state agents.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The other case cited in support of the second sentence was <i>Calvelli
and Ciglio v Italy </i>(Application No 32967/96), where the Court remarked that
procedural shortcomings had led to a time-bar in relation to any criminal
proceedings against the (private) doctor involved, but that the complainants had
been able to commence civil proceedings, which, but for the fact that they
chose to settle them, would “in the special circumstances of the instant case,
… have satisfied the positive obligations arising under article 2”: para 55.
This reasoning and decision do not directly address the subject matter of
either sentence cited above, and offer negligible support for any departure
from the rationale of any investigative obligation stated in <i>Assenov</i>. It
is also consistent with a requirement that there should be a sufficient system
for redress.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para150">150.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On this authority has however been piled a weight of subsequent
Strasbourg caselaw, including some recent Grand Chamber authority, to the
effect that the investigative duty is not, or not necessarily, confined to
cases of suspected misdoing or default by State agents. Lord Kerr and Lord
Neuberger have examined this caselaw. While its foundations or rationale may be
shaky, I cannot ignore at any rate the clear terms in which the conclusion has
now so often been expressed, to the effect that the State’s positive
investigative obligation can arise even where the relevant offence is not
arguably attributable to any State agent.</a></p><a name="para150">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para150"></a><a name="para151">151.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are however some caveats that I would make, based on such
explanations as the Court has given as to the working of this extended duty:</a></p><a name="para151">

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm"><a name="para151">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court has reiterated that the “scope” of the State’s positive
obligations might differ between cases where treatment contrary to article 3 of
the Convention has been inflicted through the involvement of State agents and
cases where violence in inflicted by private individuals: see eg <i>Beganović
v Croatia </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/992.html">[2009] ECHR 992</a>, para 62, <i>Vasilyev v Russia</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/2078.html">[2009] ECHR 2078</a>, para 100 and other cases cited by Lord Neuberger in para 88. This must
mean something in practice, even though the Court went on to say that “the
requirements as to an official investigation are similar”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court has also repeatedly emphasised that it is not concerned with
“allegations of errors or isolated omissions in the investigation”. A statement
to that effect appears in the seminal authority of <i>MC v Bulgaria</i>, para
168, and is repeated in <i>CAS v Romania </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/512.html">(2015) 61 EHRR 18</a>, para 69, <i>BV
v Croatia </i>(Application No 38435/13) and <i>BV v Belgium </i>(Application No
61030/08), paras 55-61. In place of what was once understood to be a
distinction between casual errors of judgments or acts of negligence,
consisting of “operational” as opposed to systematic failures by state servants
or agents, there is now a distinction to be drawn between simple errors or
isolated omissions in the investigation and more serious failings. In this
connection, I agree with Lord Hughes, para 123, that there is no basis for
treating this qualification on the scope of the positive investigative duty
under article 3 as confined to Strasbourg as a supra-national court, and as
irrelevant to the English domestic courts’ interpretation of article 3. I had
understood Lord Kerr to suggest the contrary, but he has clarified in paras 27
to 30 that this is not the case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In paras 27 to 30, Lord Kerr expresses a conclusion that the only
shortcomings relevant when it comes to the operational duty to conduct an
investigation are those which are “conspicuous or substantial”, or “really
serious”, or “egregious” or “obvious and significant”. Lord Hughes considers
that this is “more to present than to solve the difficulty”, and that no such
restriction is “clearly to be found anywhere in the line of Strasbourg cases
relied on”: para 136. But a distinction between mere shortcomings and more
serious failures is at least consistent with the Court’s statements of
principle set out in the previous subparagraph, and appears in the reasoning in
<i>Mustafa Tunç v Turkey </i>(Application No 24104/05), paras 189, 192 and 195.
It is also consistent with the Court’s more general jurisprudence, to the
effect that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… ill-treatment must attain a
minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of article 3. The
assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on
all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the
treatment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration, its physical
or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of
the victim …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:35.45pt">See <i>Kudla v Poland </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/512.html">[2000] 35 EHRR 198</a>, para 91; and also <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/2032.html">(2011) 53 EHRR 13</a>,
paras 164-165. It is evident from the way the Court explains the assessment of
the minimum level of severity that it is not going to be easy to predict where
it falls in any individual case.</p>

</span>The investigative duty currently under consideration should not be
confused with, and cannot be treated as part of, an <i>Osman</i> type duty on
the state to act in the face of a real and immediate threat imperilling the
life or bodily well-being of a potential victim. That would involve mining and
extending a separate strand of Strasbourg caselaw. In some cases, it would mean
there was no investigative duty at all, if no real and immediate threat was
apparent to anyone, or anyone other than the original victim, following the
original offence. The investigative duty which the Strasbourg case law, in my
opinion, now recognises is not tied down by any such restriction. It arises
from the fact of the offence. I endorse what Lord Hughes says on this aspect in
his paras 137-138.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para152">152.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I do not accept that Lord Bingham’s well-known cautionary
remarks in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Investigator </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/26.html">[2004] UKHL 26</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/26.html">[2004] 2 AC 323</a> were confined to the international level (whatever relevance that would
mean they had domestically). They were, and have correctly been understood in
later authority, such as <i>R (Al-Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/26.html">[2007] UKHL 26</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/26.html">[2008] AC 153</a>, as guidance relating to the general approach which domestic
courts should take. The general aim of the Human Rights Act was to align
domestic law with Strasbourg law. Domestic courts should not normally refuse to
follow Strasbourg authority, although circumstances can arise where this is
appropriate and a healthy dialogue may then ensue: see eg <i>R v Horncastle </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/14.html">[2009] UKSC 14</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/14.html">[2010] 2 AC 373</a>; <i>Manchester City Council v Pinnock </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/45.html">[2010] UKSC 45</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/6.html">[2011] 2 AC 104</a>, para 48 and <i>Chester v Secretary of State for Justice</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/63.html">[2013] UKSC 63</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/63.html">[2014] 1 AC 271</a>,<i> </i>paras 27-28. Conversely, domestic
courts should not, at least by way of interpretation of the Convention rights
as they apply domestically, forge ahead, without good reason. That follows, not
merely from <i>Ullah</i>, but, as Lord Hoffmann said in <i>In re G (Adoption:
Unmarried Couple) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2008] UKHL 38</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/38.html">[2009] 1 AC 173</a>, para 36, from the
“ordinary respect” attaching to the European Court of Human Rights and “the
general desirability of a uniform interpretation of the Convention in all
member states”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para153">153.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are however cases where the English courts can and should, as a
matter of domestic law, go with confidence beyond existing Strasbourg
authority: see eg <i>Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/2.html">[2012] UKSC 2</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/2.html">[2012] 2 AC 72</a>. If the existence or otherwise of a Convention right is
unclear, then it may be appropriate for domestic courts to make up their minds
whether the Convention rights should or should not be understood to embrace it.
Further, where the European Court of Human Rights has left a matter to States’
margin of appreciation, then domestic courts have to decide what the domestic
position is, what degree of involvement or intervention by a domestic court is
appropriate, and what degree of institutional respect to attach to any relevant
legislative choice in the particular area: see <i>In re G</i>, paras 30-38, per
Lord Hoffmann, para 56, per Lord Hope and paras 128-130, per Lord Mance.</p>
