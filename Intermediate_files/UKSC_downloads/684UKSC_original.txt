<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is about equitable relief from forfeiture. Specifically, the
question is whether the court has jurisdiction to grant such relief from the
loss (to use a neutral word) of rights to make specified use of neighbouring
land granted in a perpetual licence, where that loss of use is occasioned by
the exercise of a right of termination for breach of an obligation to pay a sum
due under the licence. In the present case the sum due was £50, whereas the
annual value of the rights which would be lost upon termination is agreed to be
in excess of £300,000.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Relief from forfeiture is one of those equitable remedies which plays a
valuable role in preventing the unconscionable abuse of strict legal rights for
purposes other than those for which they were conferred. But it needs to be
constrained with principled boundaries, so that the admirable certainty of
English law in the fields of business and property is not undermined by an
uncontrolled intervention of equity in any situation regarded by a judge as
unconscionable.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As will appear, the delineation of these principled boundaries has
undergone significant development by the appellate courts during the last 45
years, but mainly in relation to relief from the forfeiture of rights in
relation to chattels and other forms of personalty. This case has provided the
courts with the opportunity to re-examine those boundaries in relation to the
forfeiture of rights in relation to land and in particular to consider the
extent to which, if at all, those recent developments in relation to relief

</span>It has always been a condition for equitable relief from forfeiture that
the forfeiture provision in question should have been conferred by way of
security for the enforcement of some lesser primary obligation such as, but not
limited to, the payment of money. It is common ground, at least in this court,
that this requirement is satisfied on the facts of the case. The issues on this
appeal relate to the second main condition going to jurisdiction to relieve
from forfeiture which may loosely be described as turning upon the nature of
the subject matter of the forfeiture, that is the rights which will be lost if the
forfeiture is not relieved. The appellants say that, in relation to rights over
land, nothing less than a proprietary interest will be sufficient to engage the
jurisdiction to grant relief. The respondents say that the authorities
establish that possessory rights, falling short of a proprietary interest in
the land, are sufficient. But they invite this court to go one step further and
declare that any right to use property (whether real or personal) sufficiently
engages the jurisdiction to grant equitable relief from its forfeiture, if the
first condition, described above, is satisfied.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The trial judge, HHJ Behrens QC decided that the rights conferred by the
licence in this case were, if not strictly possessory, sufficiently analogous
to possessory rights to engage the jurisdiction, and he granted relief. The
Court of Appeal decided that this went too far, but that the relevant rights
were in any event possessory, so that they engaged the jurisdiction. Although
the question whether, assuming jurisdiction, the court ought to have granted
relief in its discretion was contested both before the judge and the Court of
Appeal, it is only the threshold question of jurisdiction which remains live in
this court.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>The appellant Manchester Ship Canal Co Ltd (“MSCC”) is the owner of the
Manchester Ship Canal (“the Canal”) and adjacent riparian land, in particular
on the south west side of it, in the vicinity of Ellesmere Port.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To the south west of MSCC’s riparian land there was a substantial block
of land, formerly in mainly military use, including an airfield, which was
acquired in July 1961 by the respondent Vauxhall Motors Ltd (formerly General
Motors UK Ltd) (“Vauxhall”) for the purpose of being developed as a substantial
vehicle manufacturing plant, now generally well known as Vauxhall’s Ellesmere
Port factory. Recognising that the construction of large buildings and hard
surfaces on the newly acquired site would reduce its capacity for the
absorption of surface water, Vauxhall sought to make arrangements with MSCC
sufficient to enable it to discharge surface water and treated industrial
effluent from the planned manufacturing complex into the Canal. For this
purpose, Vauxhall acquired from MSCC a small rectangular part of MSCC’s
riparian land between the factory site and the Canal, for the construction of a
water collection and effluent treatment plant, by a land exchange dated 12
October 1962. But this still left a small strip of riparian land owned by MSCC
between the treatment plant and the Canal, across which Vauxhall needed to
acquire a right to discharge surface water and treated effluent from the
treatment plant into the Canal. Vauxhall acquired these rights by means of a
licence (“the Licence”) made on the same date as the land exchange. Subject to the
provision for early termination referred to below, the rights were granted in
perpetuity, in exchange for payment of the “rent or annual sum” of £50 per
annum and the performance of certain covenants and conditions undertaken by
Vauxhall.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>The rights granted were set out in three parts, within clause 1 of the
Licence. The first was a right to discharge surface water and suitably treated
trade effluent from Vauxhall’s treatment plant into the Canal, across a
specified part of MSCC’s land identified on plans annexed to the Licence. The
second was a right to construct, maintain, alter and renew under and upon the
same parts of MSCC’s land pipes and other works (called “the Spillway”)
sufficient to effect and control the discharge of surface water and treated effluent
into the Canal, subject to plans and specifications to be approved by MSCC’s
Engineer. The third was a right of access to the Spillway along specified parts
of MSCC’s land for the purpose of exercising the infrastructure rights, along a
specified route or other route as prescribed by the Engineer.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>Clause 2 of the Licence provided for payment of the annual rent of £50
as already described. Clause 3 contained covenants by Vauxhall relating, among
other things, to the construction and maintenance of the Spillway, providing
for it to be rerouted in the event (which did not occur) that MSCC wished to
construct a wharf at the point of its discharge into the Canal. Clause 3(k)
required Vauxhall to remove the Spillway and reinstate the locus in quo upon determination
of the Licence. Clause 3(l) prohibited the assignment, transfer, underletting
or other alienation of the benefit of the Licence by Vauxhall other than to a
connected company. Clause 3(m) limited the use of the Spillway to the discharge
of surface water and treated trade effluent from Vauxhall’s factory site.
Clause 3 also contained miscellaneous indemnities and an obligation on Vauxhall
to pay for any dredging of the Canal necessitated by the construction and use
of the Spillway.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>Clause 4 of the Licence reserved rights to MSCC to construct and use
over, under, along or across the Spillway pipes, railway lines, cables, roads,
tramways, bridges, subways and wharves, but not so as materially to interfere
with the discharge through the Spillway of surface water and treated trade
effluent without providing Vauxhall alternative means of effecting and

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the said yearly rent or sum or

of the covenants conditions and provisions herein contained and on their part
to be performed and observed the Canal Company may (but without prejudice to
any right of action available to them by way of injunction or otherwise) by
notice in writing require Vauxhalls to pay the rent in arrear within 28 days or
(as the case may be) to pay reasonable compensation for the said default and
remedy the same (if capable of being remedied) within a reasonable time and if
Vauxhalls shall fail to comply with such notice the Canal Company may thereupon
by notice in writing determine this Licence forthwith and in such event this
Licence and every clause matter and thing herein contained shall forthwith

</span>The Spillway was duly constructed by Vauxhall following the grant of the
Licence. The infrastructure erected on MSCC’s land consists of an underground
pipe of about approximately 2,100mm diameter feeding into a partly underground
hexagonal distribution centre, before splitting into two 1,675mm underground
pipes leading to an outfall on the bank of the Canal. Following construction,
the Spillway was brought into use for discharge of surface water and treated
effluent, and has performed that function ever since.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>By a deed of variation dated 25 July 1997 the Licence was varied in the
following material respects. First, clause 3(1), restricting assignment and
alienation, was deleted and replaced by a provision “for the avoidance of
doubt” whereby MSCC acknowledged that the rights granted to Vauxhall by the
Licence were to be exercisable in perpetuity by all or any of Vauxhall, its
successors in title, the owners, tenants and occupiers from time to time of any
part of Vauxhall’s factory site. Secondly, by clause 4, Vauxhall granted MSCC a
right to connect into Vauxhall’s treatment plant a pipe discharging surface
water from neighbouring land of MSCC, for the duration of the Licence.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime Vauxhall transferred part of its factory site to the
Urban Regeneration Agency, upon terms that the land transferred would continue
to have the benefit of the drainage system constituted by the Spillway and
confirmed by the Licence.</a></p><a name="para14">

</span>The Licence was terminated in the following circumstances. Vauxhall
failed to pay its annual rent of £50 due on 12 October 2013. MSCC served notice
pursuant to clause 5 of the Licence on 6 February 2014. Vauxhall continued in
its failure to pay the £50 due and, on 10 March 2014, MSCC served notice to
terminate the Licence under clause 5.</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>After inconclusive negotiations for a new licence at market rates,
Vauxhall claimed relief from forfeiture, initially by correspondence and then
by these proceedings which were issued on 6 March 2015. As already noted the
judge granted relief from forfeiture and the Court of Appeal affirmed his
decision, albeit on slightly narrower grounds.</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="ParaHeading">The Law</p>

</span>Equitable relief from forfeiture is a remedy of ancient origin. Prior to
the conveyancing and property legislation consolidated in 1925, its main
spheres of activity lay in relation to leases and mortgages of land, but those
are now statutory. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to trace its
antecedents back before 1972, when the rationale for and main principles
regulating the remedy were restated in this well-known passage in the speech of
Lord Wilberforce in <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding</i> [1973] AC 691, at 723-724:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it remains true today that
equity expects men to carry out their bargains and will not let them buy their
way out by uncovenanted payment. But it is consistent with these principles
that we should reaffirm the right of courts of equity in appropriate and
limited cases to relieve against forfeiture for breach of covenant or condition
where the primary object of the bargain is to secure a stated result which can
effectively be attained when the matter comes before the court, and where the
forfeiture provision is added by way of security for the production of that
result. The word ‘appropriate’ involves consideration of the conduct of the
applicant for relief, in particular whether his default was wilful, of the
gravity of the breaches, and of the disparity between the value of the property
of which forfeiture is claimed as compared with the damage caused by the breach.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That passage contains a trenchant restatement of the central rationale
and condition for the exercise of the remedy, namely that the primary object of
the bargain should be the securing of a stated result, for which the forfeiture
provision is added by way of security. Lord Wilberforce did not however state
any second condition for the exercise of the jurisdiction to grant relief,
relating to the nature of the rights liable to be forfeited. Earlier, at p 722
he said:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There cannot be any doubt that
from the earliest times courts of equity have asserted the right to relieve
against the forfeiture of property. The jurisdiction has not been confined to
any particular type of case. The commonest instances concerned mortgages,
giving rise to the equity of redemption, and leases, which commonly contained
re-entry clauses; but other instances are found in relation to copy holds, or
where the forfeiture was in the nature of a penalty. Although the principle is
well established, there has undoubtedly been some fluctuation of authority as
to the self-limitation to be imposed or accepted on this power.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The property liable to forfeiture in that case was a lease but, since
the right of re-entry was reserved by an assignee of the lease rather than by
the lessor upon its grant, the statutory regime for relief from forfeiture did
not apply. Nonetheless, since the proprietary interest in land constituted by a
lease had always been fairly and squarely within the types of property liable
to forfeiture within the reach of equity’s remedy of relief, the issue as to
the nature of the property to which the remedy might extend simply did not
arise.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That question did arise for decision in <i>Scandinavian Trading Tanker
Co AB v Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana (The Scaptrade) </i>[1983] 2 AC 694. The
rights in issue consisted of the charterer’s rights under a time charter of a
ship, which entitled the owners to withdraw the vessel from the service of the
charterers if specified monthly payments due in advance were not made on time.
Having failed to make timely payment and received a telex from the owners
withdrawing the vessel, the charterers claimed that withdrawal amounted to a
forfeiture and sought equitable relief, including an injunction restraining the
owners from withdrawing the vessel from service. Affirming the Court of Appeal,
the House of Lords held that the court had no jurisdiction to grant relief in
such a case.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Giving the leading judgment, Lord Diplock identified two reasons for
that conclusion, in relation to time charters. The first was that a time
charter conferred upon the charterer no interest in or right to possession of
the vessel. He said, at pp 700-701:</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para21">“A time charter, unless it is a
charter by demise, with which your Lordships are not here concerned, transfers
to the charterer no interest in or right to possession of the vessel; it is a
contract for services to be rendered to the charterer by the shipowner through
the use of the vessel by the shipowner’s own servants, the master and the crew,
acting in accordance with such directions as to the cargoes to be loaded and
the voyages to be undertaken as by the terms of the charterparty the charterer
is entitled to give to them. Being a contract for services it is thus the very
prototype of a contract of which before the fusion of law and equity a court
would never grant specific performance: <i>Clarke v Price</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1819/594.pdf">(1819) 2 Wils
157</a>; <i>Lumley v Wagner</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1852/602.pdf">(1852) 1 De G M &amp; G 604</a>. … To grant an
injunction restraining the shipowner from exercising his right of withdrawal of
the vessel from the service of the charterer, though negative in form, is
pregnant with an affirmative order to the shipowner to perform the contract;
juristically it is indistinguishable from a decree for specific performance of
a contract to render services; and in respect of that category of contracts,
even in the event of breach, this is a remedy that English courts have always
disclaimed any jurisdiction to grant. This is, in my view, sufficient reason in
itself to compel rejection of the suggestion that the equitable principle of
relief from forfeiture is juristically capable of extension so as to grant to
the court a discretion to prevent a shipowner from exercising his strict
contractual rights under a withdrawal clause in a time charter which is not a
charter by demise.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At p 702, referring to the dicta of Lord Wilberforce in the <i>Shiloh
Spinners </i>case, he said:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That this mainly historical
statement was never meant to apply generally to contracts not involving any
transfer of proprietary or possessory rights, but providing for a right to
determine the contract in default of punctual payment of a sum of money payable
under it, is clear enough from Lord Wilberforce’s speech in <i>The Laconia </i>[1977]
AC 850. Speaking of a time charter he said, at p 870: ‘It must be obvious that
this is a very different type of creature from a lease of land.’”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Diplock’s second reason was that, in any event, the provision that
the owner could withdraw the vessel upon failure by the charterer to make
payment in advance was not a mere security, since timely payment was needed to
fund the wages and victualling of the master and crew together with the
insurance and maintenance of the vessel sufficient to enable her to perform the
contracted services.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For present purposes, the key phrases which stand out from Lord
Diplock’s speech are, “no interest in or right to possession of the vessel”, on
p 700 and “proprietary or possessory rights” on p 702. He used the concepts of
proprietary and possessory rights as a <i>sine qua non</i> in relation to the
rights liable to be forfeited, in the absence of which equity could not
intervene. The sharp distinction in his mind between a time charter, which did
not confer those rights, and a charter by demise, which did, may be illuminated
by the following explanation from Evans LJ in <i>Bridge Oil Ltd v Owners and/or
demise charterers of the ship ‘The Guiseppe di Vittorio’</i> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 136, at 156:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“What then is a demise charter?
Its hallmarks, as it seems to me, are that the legal owner gives the charterer
sufficient of the rights of possession and control which enable the transaction
to be regarded as a letting - a lease, or demise, in real property terms - of the
ship. Closely allied to this is the fact that the charterer becomes the
employer of the master and crew.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The condition for jurisdiction to grant equitable relief from
forfeiture, that the rights subject to forfeiture should be proprietary or
possessory in nature first enunciated, in a negative sense, in <i>The</i> <i>Scaptrade</i>,
have been followed in a series of later cases, mainly about chattels and other
forms of personal property, rather than rights in relation to land. S<i>port
International Bussum BV v Inter-Footwear Ltd </i>[1984] 1 WLR 776 was a case
about an exclusive right to purchase sports shoes and resell them in specified
territories contained in an agreement settling litigation which included a
provision for termination upon (inter alia) the buyer’s failure to provide a
security guarantee on time. Giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, after a
review of the <i>Shiloh Spinners</i> case and <i>The Scaptrade</i>, Oliver LJ
said, at p 787B that:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… historically, the availability
of equitable relief from forfeiture has been confined to cases where the
subject matter of the forfeiture is an interest in land.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:0cm">At p 788C he continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The fact remains that the
jurisdiction never was, and never has been up to now, extended to ordinary
commercial contracts unconnected with interests in land and, though it may be
that there is no logical reason why, by analogy with contracts creating
interests in land, the jurisdiction should not be extended to contracts
creating interests in other property, corporeal or incorporeal, there is, at the
same time, no compelling reason of policy that we can see why it should be. And
the fact is that the defendant in this case is seeking an extension by analogy,
and an extension not based on any pressing consideration of legal policy but
simply on an appeal to sympathy for what is considered to be a hardship arising
from strict adherence to a bargain which is concluded with its eyes open.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the House of Lords, Lord Templeman noted at p 794 that Lord Diplock
had, in <i>The</i> <i>Scaptrade</i>, confined the power to relieve from
forfeiture to contracts concerning the transfer of proprietary or possessory
rights. He continued:</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not believe that the present
is a suitable case in which to define the boundaries of the equitable doctrine
of relief against forfeiture. It is sufficient that the appellants cannot bring
themselves within the recognised boundaries and cannot establish an arguable
case for the intervention of equity. The recognised boundaries do not include
mere contractual licences and I can see no reason for the intervention of
equity. Your Lordships are concerned with an unusual contract bringing hostile
litigation to an end and including a number of provisions which cannot be
dissected so as to attribute different degrees of importance to different rights
and obligations.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms Katharine Holland QC for MSCC drew attention, correctly, to the fact
that Oliver LJ referred only to proprietary, rather than possessory, rights as
sufficient to attract equitable relief from forfeiture. This was part of his
description of the history of the remedy. It was not endorsed by the House of
Lords, although other parts of Oliver LJ’s analysis were. Nor has it stood the
test of time, as appears below.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span><i>BICC plc v Burndy Corpn</i> [1985] Ch 232 was about the forfeiture of
patent rights conferred under a commercial agreement. Dillon LJ (with whom Kerr
and Ackner LJJ agreed) said this, at p 252:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is no clear authority, but
for my part I find it difficult to see why the jurisdiction of equity to grant
relief against forfeiture should only be available where what is liable to
forfeiture is an interest in land and not an interest in personal property.
Relief is only available where what is in question is forfeiture of proprietary
or possessory rights, but I see no reason in principle for drawing a
distinction as to the type of property in which the rights subsist. The fact
that the right to forfeiture arises under a commercial agreement is highly
relevant to the question whether relief against forfeiture should be granted,
but I do not see that it can preclude the existence of the jurisdiction to
grant relief, if forfeiture of proprietary or possessory rights, as opposed to
merely contractual rights, is in question.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In his dissenting judgment,
Godfrey JA said that the case ‘cries out for the intervention of equity’. Their
Lordships think that, on the contrary, it shows the need for a firm restatement
of the principle that in cases of rescission of an ordinary contract of sale of
land for failure to comply with an essential condition as to time, equity will
not intervene.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This decision is not of significant assistance for present purposes. It
was a case in which a contract for the purchase of legal title to land was
found to have been repudiated by the failure by the purchaser to comply with a
time of the essence provision. Thus the property the subject matter of the
contract never became subject to the vendor’s obligation to convey. While it
may be said that the purchaser had a species of equitable interest pending
completion, the facts were far removed from cases such as the present, where
the rights subject to forfeiture are perpetual in nature and have already been
conferred and enjoyed for many years prior to the event giving rise to
termination.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>Most of the cases about relief from the forfeiture of possessory (rather
than proprietary) rights concern personalty. Nonetheless, some slight
indication that possessory rights in relation to land may also qualify for
relief from forfeiture is to be found in the judgment of Nourse LJ in <i>Bland
v Ingrams Estates Ltd </i>[2001] Ch 767. The plaintiff had a charging order
(creating an equitable charge) over a lease of land. The landlord forfeited the
lease and the lessees did not apply for relief. On application for relief from
forfeiture under the court’s inherent jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal held
that, in an area so heavily regulated by statute, equity ought not to
intervene. Nonetheless the plaintiff was able to stand in the shoes of the
lessees so as to assert their statutory right to relief, as if he was a
beneficiary under a trust. In reviewing the inherent equitable jurisdiction
Nourse LJ said this, at p 780 (para 31):</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A jurisdiction does not become
discretionary just because it is both inherent and equitable. The authorities
show that the cases in which the inherent jurisdiction to grant relief against
forfeiture for non-payment of rent has been exercised have been restricted to
those in which the person claiming relief is entitled to possession of the land
or at any rate, which is not necessarily the same thing, has a legal estate or
equitable interest in it. Now that so much of the jurisdiction has been
overtaken by statute, any legitimate basis for its extension has disappeared.
Admittedly and notoriously, there are gaps and anomalies in the statutory framework.
But it is not for the courts to fill the gaps and cure the anomalies in
purported reliance on a jurisdiction which has never existed.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Nourse LJ appears to have regarded a right to possession
of land as having qualified, historically, for equitable relief from
forfeiture. Nonetheless it is slender authority for the resolution of the
present issue. It deserves mention only because all of the other relevant cases
are about rights in relation to chattels or other personalty, rather than land.</p>

</span><i>On Demand Information plc v Michael Gerson (Finance) plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/13.html">[2003] 1 AC 368</a> was about forfeiture of rights in relation to video and editing
equipment granted under finance leases. The leases provided a three-year period
for use by the lessee at a substantial rent, provision for yearly extensions
for modest payments and provision that, upon termination (if they had performed
their obligations) the lessees could sell the equipment and retain 95% of the
proceeds. For present purposes the relevant issue was whether the equitable
jurisdiction was restricted to cases of forfeiture of proprietary rights. At p
379 (para 29) Lord Millett said this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Court of Appeal (Pill and
Robert Walker LJJ, Sir Murray Stuart-Smith dissenting) [2001] 1 WLR 155
dismissed the lessee’s appeal. The court unanimously upheld the deputy judge’s
ruling that the criteria for the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction were
present at the date of the application. They rejected the lessor’s objection
that the leases were purely contractual in nature, and that the jurisdiction to
grant relief from forfeiture was restricted to cases where the forfeiture of
proprietary rights strictly so-called was in question. As Robert Walker LJ put
it, contractual rights which entitle the hirer to indefinite possession of
chattels so long as the hire payments are duly made, and which qualify and
limit the owner’s general property in the chattels, cannot aptly be described
as purely contractual rights. For my own part, I regard this conclusion as in
accordance with principle; any other would restrict the exercise of a
beneficent jurisdiction without any rational justification.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is the first occasion upon which a perception that possessory
rights of an indefinite duration could qualify for equitable relief from forfeiture
was enunciated. Although not apparent from <i>The Scaptrade</i>, the relevance
of the indefinite duration of the possessory right was reinforced by Hamblen J
in <i>Celestial Aviation Trading 71 Ltd v Paramount Airways Private Ltd</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/185.html">[2011] 1 All ER (Comm) 259</a>, a case about rights of limited duration under
operating leases of aircraft. By contrast with the typical finance lease
considered in the <i>On Demand</i> case, the operating leases for eight years
conferred no rights upon the lessee to extend or to acquire the aircraft on
termination. The aircraft had a substantial expected operational life after
termination so that the interest of the lessor was not merely financial or
economic. Hamblen J held that there was no jurisdiction to grant relief from
the forfeiture of an operating lease of this kind. At para 57 he said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In summary, whilst I accept that
the ASLAs transfer possessory rights to Paramount, for the relief jurisdiction
to apply to contracts transferring a bare possessory right for only a
proportion of the economic life of the chattel would represent a major
extension of existing authority.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He also concluded that the forfeiture provision was not
merely by way of security, and that there were strong policy reasons why relief
should not be available for operating leases of this type.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the extent of the equitable jurisdiction was thoroughly
reviewed by the Privy Council in <i>Çukurova Finance International Ltd v Alpha
Telecom Turkey Ltd (Nos 3-5)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2013/2.html">[2016] AC 923</a>, a case about a contractual
power to appropriate shares, charged by way of equitable mortgage to secure
repayment of a loan. For present purposes the importance of the decision lies
in the Board’s treatment of the submission that equitable relief from
forfeiture was limited, in the context of mortgages, to mortgages of real
property rather than personalty. After citing the passage from the judgment of
Dillon LJ in the <i>BICC</i> case (quoted above) the Board continued, at para
94:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That reasoning, with which the
Board agrees, supports the conclusion that relief from forfeiture is available
in principle where what is in question is forfeiture of proprietary or
possessory rights, as opposed to merely contractual rights, regardless of the
type of property concerned.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Analysis</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issues as to the extent of the jurisdiction to grant equitable
relief from forfeiture have, if anything, widened since the hearing in the
Court of Appeal. At that stage it appears to have been common ground that the
jurisdiction did extend to relief against the forfeiture of possessory rights
in relation to land. MSCC did not submit that the jurisdiction was limited to
proprietary rights (as it does before this court) and Vauxhall did not submit
that the jurisdiction extended to any rights to use property, regardless
whether they were strictly possessory, as it now does before this court. Rather
the issue was whether the rights granted by the Licence were truly possessory
in the relevant sense. There were also issues about whether the termination
right in clause 5 was by way of security, and issues about discretion, but they
have fallen by the wayside.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is convenient to begin by addressing MSCC’s main submission that the
jurisdiction to grant equitable relief from the forfeiture of rights relating
to the land is limited to rights which, on settled principles, amount to a
proprietary interest, so that merely possessory rights, and therefore all
rights conferred by licences, are insufficient.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms Holland advanced a series of interconnected arguments about why this
should be so. Her main point was that there had always existed a fundamental,
well-settled and clearly understood distinction between proprietary interests
in land and other rights relating to land, encapsulated in the distinction
between a lease, which did confer a proprietary interest and a licence, which
did not. Thus the boundary between a lease and a licence has traditionally been
assumed also to be a boundary for the jurisdiction from relief from forfeiture,
as is apparent from para 4.1.69 of Gray and Gray’s Elements of Land Law, 5th ed
(2008):</a></p><a name="para37">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Only a tenant - and not
licensee - may ask for relief against forfeiture.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Any other boundary for the intervention of equity into
contractual arrangements conferring rights over land, and in particular which
admitted possessory rights in addition to proprietary interests, would be
causative of damaging uncertainty in an area of the law in which certainty
commands a premium.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, she submitted that although the concept of a possessory right
appeared to have become entrenched in defining the boundary of equitable relief
from the forfeiture of rights in relation to chattels and other personalty,
this should not be transplanted so as to move the boundary line in connection
with rights over land. This was first because the concept of possession as used
in the authorities about chattels was different from the concept of possession
in relation to land, and more akin to a form of ownership.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, because possession in the context of land had no single clear
or settled meaning, its use for the identification of the boundary of equity’s
intervention would be a recipe for confusion and uncertainty.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These are formidable submissions. It is undoubtedly true that certainty
is, or should be, an important element of land law. As Fox LJ said in <i>Ashburn
Anstalt v Arnold</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1988/14.html">[1989] Ch 1</a>, at p 26:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In matters relating to the title
to land, certainty is of prime importance.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But certainty is equally important in the law of commerce, and one of
the reasons why English commercial law is chosen around the world by commercial
counterparties to govern their contracts, even when neither they nor the
subject matter have any connection with England. The authorities summarised
above, beginning with <i>The</i> <i>Scaptrade</i>, demonstrate that English
commercial law has accommodated the concept of possessory rights in relation to
personalty as sufficiently defining the boundary of equity’s intervention by
way of relief from forfeiture, over a wide range of different types of subject
matter, including ships and (potentially) aircraft, trademarks and patents,
video equipment and shares. If the concept of possessory rights as part of the
relevant boundary causes no damaging uncertainty in those widely varied
commercial contexts, there is no immediately obvious reason why it should do so
in relation to rights over land.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal had no difficulty in identifying a sufficiently
certain concept behind the phrase possessory rights in relation to land. Basing
himself on <i>JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/30.html">[2003] 1 AC 419</a>, Lewison LJ
said, at para 59:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There are two elements to the
concept of possession: (1) a sufficient degree of physical custody and control
(‘factual possession’); (2) an intention to exercise such custody and control
on one’s own behalf and for one’s own benefit (‘intention to possess’). What
amounts to a sufficient degree of physical custody and control will depend on
the nature of the relevant subject matter and the manner in which that subject
matter is commonly enjoyed. The existence of the intention to possess is to be objectively
ascertained and will usually be deduced from the acts carried out by the putative
possessor …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">While that concept is drawn from a case about adverse
possession, it is a practical and workable concept which, although necessarily
fact-based, involves no inherent uncertainty.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not accept Ms Holland’s submission that the use of the concept of
possessory rights in relation to chattels and other personalty in the decided
cases equates to something more akin to ownership, and therefore a proprietary
interest, in relation to land. As is apparent from the citation from <i>The</i>
<i>Scaptrade</i> and <i>Guiseppe di Vittorio</i> cases, the essence of a demise
charter which sets it apart from a pure time charter is that it gives the
charterer not ownership of the vessel, but possession and control of it. I
consider that the frequent use in the decided cases of the words proprietary or
possessory as alternatives in relation to rights over personalty clearly points
to a recognition that a purely possessory right is something falling short of
ownership, or of a proprietary interest.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are to be weighed against MSCC’s submission powerful reasons why,
now that it is settled that equitable relief may apply to forfeiture of
possessory rights in relation to a wide range of chattels and other personalty,
it should also do so in relation to possessory rights over land. First, the
original proving ground for equitable relief from forfeiture consisted of
rights in relation to land, originally, but not only, leases and mortgages. It
would be strange indeed if equity’s reach was wider in relation to rights over
chattels and other forms of personalty than over rights in relation to land.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, as was noted by Robert Walker LJ and Lord Millett in the <i>On-Demand</i>
case, and by Dillon LJ in <i>BICC plc v Burndy Corpn</i>, there is simply no
logic or reason in principle for drawing a distinction as to the type of
property in which the rights subsist, when considering the extent of equity’s
jurisdiction to relieve from forfeiture. If therefore it is the nature of the
right rather than the identity of the property over which it may be exercised
that matters, then there must be every good reason to apply a jurisdiction
applicable to possessory rights as much to rights over land as to rights over
other forms of property.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would acknowledge that a recognition that equity may relieve against
the forfeiture of possessory rights over real property, falling short of a
proprietary interest, means that the simple assumption of the editors of <i>Gray
and Gray</i> that relief may never be granted from the forfeiture of a licence
calls for re-examination. There will be many licences which only grant rights
falling short of possession, for which that simple proposition will still hold
good. As will appear, the Licence granted in the present case was a very
unusual one, both because it granted an element of virtually exclusive possession,
coupled with a high degree of control over the locus in quo, and because it was
granted in perpetuity. It by no means follows from a conclusion that the rights
conferred by this Licence are within equity’s jurisdiction to relieve from
forfeiture, that licences in relation to land will fall generally within that
same boundary.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally in relation to this issue, while it is essential for the
certainty of the law that the scope for equitable intervention on grounds of
unconscionability should be delimited by reference to reasonably clear
boundaries, they should be identified by reference to a principled
understanding of the nature and purpose of the relevant equity, rather than be
merely arbitrary. The careful examination and development of the reasons why
that boundary should accommodate relief from the forfeiture of possessory
rights in the authorities cited above seems to me to be clearly in accordance
with that principled approach. By contrast, the slavish adoption of a rule that
nothing other than a proprietary interest will do, in relation to land, does
nothing of the kind.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This may be illustrated in this case by the fact that the Licence
granted rights over MSCC’s land very similar to, and indeed more extensive
than, rights in the nature of an easement. It is common ground that an easement
creates an interest in land, so that its forfeiture may be relieved against.
There is no principled reason why the perpetual rights granted by the Licence
should not do.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary next to address Vauxhall’s submission that a better
boundary than one which merely accommodated possessory rights would be one
which extended the equitable jurisdiction in relation to all forms of right to
use property, provided only that the right of termination is intended to secure
the payment of money for the performance of other obligations. I would reject
this submission as well. It was heavily based upon an over-literal reading of
Lord Wilberforce’s speech in <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding</i> which, as
noted above, did not include as a condition of the existence of the
jurisdiction any requirement as to the nature or quality of the rights liable
to forfeiture. But he had no reason to do so, since the rights liable to
forfeiture in that case amounted to a proprietary interest in land, and the
question whether the jurisdiction might extend to any right to the use of
property never arose for argument, let alone decision.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To expand the ambit of the equitable jurisdiction in that way, leaving
all control upon its use as a matter of discretion, would offend against the
well-recognised need to ensure that equity does not undermine the certainty of
the law. Furthermore it would set at nought the careful development of the
principled limitation of the jurisdiction to the forfeiture of proprietary or
possessory rights, worked out over many years in a succession of broadly
coherent authorities.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would however wish to sound one note of caution against the slavish
application of the whole of that jurisprudence to land. The requirement,
developed in the <i>On Demand</i> and <i>Celestial</i> cases that the
possessory right should be one which is indefinite, rather than time-limited to
a period shorter than the full economic life of the chattel or other species of
personal property, may have unintended consequences in relation to land.
Chattels by their nature are of limited economic life, and most intellectual
property rights, and patents in particular, have their own inherent
time-limitations. By contrast, land is a form of perpetual property, and I can
well conceive of forms of possessory rights in relation to land which are not
perpetual, but which might nonetheless qualify for equitable relief from
forfeiture. The point need not be decided in this case since, most unusually,
this Licence was indeed granted in perpetuity. It is to be noted that the
acknowledgment in <i>The Scaptrade </i>that equity might relieve from the
forfeiture of a demise charter (which is typically for much less than the
economic life of the ship) suggests that even in relation to chattels a rule
that the possessory right should be indefinite may go too far.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It remains to consider whether the Court of Appeal was right to conclude
that the rights granted by the Licence fell within that possessory class to
which the jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture extends. It is common
ground that they conferred no proprietary interest in favour of Vauxhall over
MSCC’s adjacent land. Ms Holland submitted that the rights also fell short of
granting the requisite degree of possession and control over MSCC’s land, lying
between Vauxhall’s treatment works and the Canal itself, to be regarded as
possessory in the relevant sense. She emphasised, with force, that this
question depended upon the nature of the rights granted, rather than merely
upon the extent to which, following the grant of the Licence, Vauxhall rather
than MSCC occupied or controlled the Spillway for the purpose of its
construction, maintenance and operation. Her main point was that the essence of
the right granted by the Licence was that of discharge of surface water and
treated effluent, and that the rights to construct, maintain and operate the
Spillway were strictly ancillary. The mere right of discharge did not involve
possession, let alone exclusive possession, and in any event the terms of the
Licence reserved to MSCC a substantial degree of control, over both the
construction and maintenance of the Spillway, including a right to have the
infrastructure enlarged or rerouted in stated circumstances.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, even if the court were to find that Vauxhall had possessory
rights in relation to the infrastructure constituting the Spillway, Ms Holland
submitted that there was no forfeiture of that right, because Vauxhall was both
entitled and indeed obliged to remove and recover the infrastructure on
termination of the Licence.</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These submissions were advanced with equal force before the Court of
Appeal, where they constituted the central part of MSCC’s case. Giving the
leading judgment, Lewison LJ dealt with them with conspicuous care and detail
before concluding that the Licence did indeed confer the requisite possessory
rights.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have already concluded that the Court of Appeal applied the correct
legal test to this question. Beyond that the issue turned on the application of
that test to detailed facts, from which this court would be slow to depart from
the Court of Appeal unless it was clearly wrong.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is sufficient for the disposal of this last issue for me to say that
nothing in Ms Holland’s submissions on this point came near to persuading me that
Lewison LJ’s analysis was wrong. On the contrary, if it were necessary to
conduct that analysis afresh, I would find it difficult to improve upon his, in
particular at paras 66-69 of the judgment. Nonetheless out of respect for Ms
Holland’s careful submissions, I will provide the following summary of my own
reasoning.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point is that, as is common ground, the infrastructure
works carried out entirely by Vauxhall for the purpose of creating the Spillway
became, upon their completion, part of MSCC’s land, because they were fixtures.
The question therefore is whether Vauxhall had the requisite degree of
possession and control of the Spillway itself. In my view it clearly did. The
infrastructure consisted largely of underground pipes and chambers which were,
in practice, only or at least mainly accessible from Vauxhall’s treatment
plant. The practical reality was that the Spillway formed an integral part of
the infrastructure for the transmission of surface water and treated effluent
from Vauxhall’s factory site, the remainder of which, including further
retaining structures, pipes and a substantial ravine all lay on Vauxhall’s
land. Although MSCC had certain default rights to intervene if Vauxhall failed
adequately to maintain and operate the Spillway, and a right to re-route it if
it caused difficulties at its point of discharge into the Canal, none of these
significantly impacted upon the reality that Vauxhall would be the dominant
player in the maintenance and operation of the Spillway once constructed. Of
course, the whole of the construction itself was Vauxhall’s undertaking. Using
the chartering analogy derived from <i>The</i> <i>Scaptrade</i>, far from MSCC
providing a service to Vauxhall for the discharge of its surface water and
treated effluent, Vauxhall built, operated and maintained that infrastructure,
and had exclusive perpetual use of it, subject only to MSCC’s right of
termination for breach of covenant in clause 5. It is in that context nothing
to the point that, by later transactions, Vauxhall permitted MSCC to discharge
water from its own land into Vauxhall’s treatment works for onward transmission
along the Spillway into the Canal. That additional flow became Vauxhall’s
discharge once it left the treatment works, and in no way detracted from Vauxhall
having exclusive use of the Spillway.</a></p><a name="para57">

</span>Finally, there is nothing in Ms Holland’s point that, upon termination,
Vauxhall was obliged to remove and recover the infrastructure which constituted
the Spillway, so that there was no forfeiture. All Vauxhall would recover by
the performance of that expensive obligation would be a collection of useless
debris. The notion that nothing was thereby forfeited has no foundation in
reality.</a></p><a name="para58">

</span>I agree with Lord Briggs that relief from forfeiture can be given where
the rights in land are possessory only, which was a new point taken in this
Court, and that the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the rights were possessory
is unassailable. This judgment considers whether to hold that there is
jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture in the case of a licence of land
where the rights are possessory only introduces an unacceptable element of
uncertainty into the law.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the question of certainty in the law, the present case is
relatively unusual because it involves relief from forfeiture in relation to a
licence over land, and not a lease where the lessee will have a proprietary
interest in the land. However, this licence was not a lease by reason only that
it operates in perpetuity and not for a certain time as required at common law.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where in any case relief from forfeiture is given, the party seeking
forfeiture will not be able to use the property in the way in which he expected
to do in the event of breach, and this may reduce the value and marketability
of his asset. The operation of the agreement according to its express terms
will be rendered uncertain if the licensee can apply for relief. Thus, it might
be said that by allowing relief from forfeiture in respect of rights acquired
under a mere licence, which moreover applies a test of possession for that
purpose which depends on the successful party establishing a particular state
of fact (involving no doubt the consideration of the totality of the relevant
facts), the court has produced a situation in which an unacceptable element of
certainty has been introduced. In my judgment, this is an important issue with
which the court must grapple. It can only be resolved by looking at the loss of
certainty resulting from this decision in the wider context of the operation of
the doctrine.</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Standpoint for analysing the relief from forfeiture and
the role of equity</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The doctrine of relief from forfeiture is an equitable doctrine. I would
approach it from the standpoint of equity rather than through the prism of
property law. Equity is a body of principles which alleviates the strict
application of rules of law in appropriate cases. In this case, the relevant
rule of law is that the court will enforce the terms of the parties’ agreement
because there is no reason in law why it should not be enforced. Equity serves
to finesse rules of law in deserving cases. It thus makes the system of law in
England and Wales one which is more likely to produce a fair result than would
be possible if equity did not exist. This must surely be one of the reasons why
the law of England and Wales is held in high regard in the world.</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Some uncertainty is inevitable</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some element of uncertainty in the application of the doctrine of relief
from forfeiture is inevitable. Equity in general operates by principles rather
than by rules. That means that relief from forfeiture is not an automatic
consequence if particular conditions are fulfilled but instead is given in
appropriate cases. It is not a foregone conclusion that once the conditions for
relief are shown relief will necessarily be granted and that inevitably means
an element of uncertainty about its availability.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another element of inherent uncertainty arises from the fact that the
doctrine of relief from forfeiture is a general doctrine and will apply to new
circumstances, such as where the court has to deal with a particular form of
property, or (as here) interest in or in relation to property, for the first
time. The most obvious new circumstances are the creation of new forms of
property or interest in property, such as shares in a registered company or
aircraft. Thinking ahead, it may be applied in the future to forms of property
which only exist in the cybersphere, or to rights which are treated as to all
intents and purposes as rights to property (see eg M Solinas <i>Bitcoiners in
Wonderland: Lessons from the Cheshire Cat </i>(2019) LMCLQ 433). I note that
the view that the law of forfeiture may yet expand in this general area is
supported by Professor Ben McFarlane in <i>Snell’s Equity</i>, 33rd ed (2015),
para 13-023, cited by Lewison LJ in his judgment in this case (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1100.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 1100</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1100.html">[2019] Ch 331</a>, paras 50-51).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It inevitably follows that there will be respects in which the equitable
doctrine of relief from forfeiture will be “unfenced”. So, while I agree with
Lord Briggs that there is a need for there to be certainty in this area of the
law, especially in the commercial field, I would go further and conclude that
certainty for the purposes of a general doctrine of equity differs from that
which results from a hard-edged rule of law. As Sir Richard Arden MR explained
in <i>Eaton v Lyon</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1798/76.pdf">(1798) 3 Ves 689</a>, 693, 30 ER 1223:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<span style="color:#212121">At
Law a covenant must be strictly and literally performed: in Equity it must be
really and substantially performed according to the true intent and meaning of
the parties, so far as circumstances will admit.</span>”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Types of rights or types of cases?</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Briggs points out that a mere contractual licence alone would not
be enough to give rise to relief from forfeiture. There would typically be an
exclusive licence (above, para 46). I agree that it is likely to be necessary
to establish possessory rights, but I would go further and hold that the law
recognises that there are cases in which equitable relief will not be given
even if there is an interest in property of a proprietary or possessory kind.
But before I reach that stage, I must retrace my steps and travel over a little
of the history of relief from forfeiture.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Lord Briggs explains, equitable relief from forfeiture is a remedy of
ancient origin. It is inevitably difficult, given the long history of equity,
to say that the doctrine was ever finally constituted in a particular form.
Rather it kept evolving as the social and economic life of the nation changed:
the law of equity developed and keeps on developing. Questions such as this
case raises as to whether particular forms of property interest are or are not
within the reach of the doctrine would have no meaning in a society which did
not discover the utility of them until later in its history.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As time went on, the doctrine applied to both real and personal property
and to intangible as well as tangible property, as need arose. I would prefer
to express no view on the wider definition of an interest in property involved
in the respondents’ alternative argument since it does not need to be decided
on this appeal and has not been fully argued. There is a degree of uncertainty
in the concept of possessory rights in relation to land, and it may be that an
extension to rights to use property may not involve any significant further
degree of uncertainty.</a></p><a name="para69">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The fundamental principle giving rise to relief from
forfeiture</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What then is the principle on which equity acts when it grants relief
from forfeiture? The fundamental principle was, as Lord Briggs has said, that
equity intervenes to restrain forfeiture where (1) the right had been conferred
to secure the performance of some other covenant and (2) although the
covenantor had breached his covenant, he was now in a position to perform it
and to pay any compensation that might be appropriate: see <i>Peachy v Duke of
Somerset</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1721/367.pdf">(1721) Prec Ch 568</a>; 24 ER 255. These are the preconditions to
relief from forfeiture in the sense that they must be present, but they are not
necessarily sufficient of themselves to justify the intervention of equity,
even putting on one side the exercise of the judge’s discretion. In the
striking phrase of Dr P G Turner in his valuable case note on the decision of
the Court of Appeal in this case (entitled <i>What delimits equitable relief
from forfeiture?)</i>:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Equity will only relieve where
the security purpose stands ahead of any other.” ((2019) 78(2) CLJ 276, 279)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, this was a statement of general principle, not limited to any
particular sort of property.</a></p><a name="para71">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Forfeiture and penalties</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Forfeiture and penalties are often coupled together, and forfeiture and
penalties often operated within the same legal and factual space. In <i>Sloman
v Walter</i> (1784) 1 Bro Ch C 418, the parties were partners in a coffee
house. The plaintiff conducted the business of the coffee house but he agreed
with the defendant that the defendant should have the use of a particular room
in the coffee house when he required it. This promise was secured by a bond for
£500. On one occasion he asked to use it and was refused. The defendant then
sued to enforce the bond. Lord Thurlow LC held:</a></p><a name="para72">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<span style="color:#212121">the
only question was, whether this was to be considered as a penalty, or as assessed
damages. The rule, that where a penalty is inserted merely to secure the
enjoyment of a collateral object, the enjoyment of the object is considered as
the principal intent of the deed, and the penalty only as accessional, and,
therefore, only to secure the damage really incurred, is too strongly
established in equity to be shaken. This case is to be considered in that light
…</span>”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason to think that the kindred doctrine of forfeiture was
restricted to covenants to secure the payment of money any more than penalties.</a></p><a name="para73">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Fluctuations in the doctrine of relief from forfeiture</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes the law has developed, and then retraced its steps. Thus, in
several cases, the courts decided in favour of granting relief to a tenant who
had committed a breach of covenant which did not involve the payment of money,
such as cutting timber when he should not have done so. The courts were
prepared to grant relief against these breaches just as they did against the
payment of rent. But then Lord Eldon LC in <i>Hill v Barclay</i> (1811) 18 Ves
Jun 56, 64; </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1811/288.pdf">34 ER 238</a> firmly held that the breach had to be of a covenant to
pay money. He held that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The distinction has been taken,
that relief may be had against the breach of a covenant to pay money at a given
day; but, not, where any thing else is to be done. … In all these cases the law
having ascertained the contract, and the rights of the contracting parties, a
Court of Equity ought not to interfere.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75">75.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This meant that Parliament had in due course to provide by statute for
relief against forfeiture for lessees of land, including those who were in
breach of a covenant other than a covenant to pay rent, where the lessor was
seeking to exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture: see now section 146 of
the Law of Property Act 1925. The legislature intervened in relation to leases
but its intervention did not mean that relief from forfeiture was not capable
of being invoked in cases not covered by legislation, as Lord Wilberforce (with
whom the other members of the House agreed) explained in <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd
v Harding</i> [1973] AC 691 at 725. There was an inconclusive discussion at the
hearing of this appeal as to whether parties could contract out of forfeiture
relief under the general law. In this connection, I note that section 146(12)
expressly rules this out in relation to relief under that section.</a></p><a name="para75">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Issue is whether the circumstances satisfy the doctrine
not the type of interest</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where the conditions described by Lord Briggs (above, para 17) were
fulfilled, and assuming that the complainant had some relevant form of
entitlement to property which would be affected by the forfeiture, the doctrine
of forfeiture applied unless there was some good reason why it should not do
so, such as where relief from forfeiture was inconsistent with some statutory
right, or the case fell within a class of case where relief was not given.
Equity did not, therefore, ask whether the forfeiture would be of a particular
type of interest in property. Nor, as far as I can see from the case law, did
equity, in the case of tangible movable property, draw arbitrary distinctions
between movable and immovable property such as whether the period for which the
applicant had any right in the property was for the whole or substantially the
whole of its economic life: there can be no doubt that in theory a lease of
land in respect of which forfeiture might be given may be for a short period,
say a month.</a></p><a name="para76">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>No relief from forfeiture for termination under
ordinary and lawful commercial bargain</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So, as it seems to me, the primary question that has to be resolved in
relation to the doctrine of relief from forfeiture outside leases of land and
mortgages is not what relationships to property it covers but whether the
circumstances in which it is sought to be invoked are those in which equity
would grant relief.</a></p><a name="para77">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no exhaustive list of those cases, but one of them is where the
bargain giving rise to the forfeiture is an ordinary and lawful commercial bargain
inconsistent with equity granting such relief from forfeiture (unless of course
the right involved a penalty). Lord Briggs has already given an example of this
namely <i>The Scaptrade</i>. On my approach this does not critically turn on
the difference between charters by demise and time charters. The commercial
bargain in that case required the time charterer to make his payments timeously
and it was well understood between commercial people that the ship would be
withdrawn if that did not happen because the shipowner needed the payments to
be made timeously in order to provide a fully-equipped ship.</a></p><a name="para78">

</span>An earlier case in this field is <i>Sparks v The Company of Proprietors
of Liverpool Water-works</i> (1807) 13 Ves Jun 428; </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1807/191.pdf">33 ER 354</a>, which concerns
intangible property, namely the rights conferred by a share. In this case, the
plaintiff was a shareholder in a statutory company formed to supply water to
Liverpool. The company had issued shares, which were partly paid. Under its
articles, calls could be made by notice which was to be a maximum of 21 days.
The plaintiff was absent from his address and did not receive notice of the
call in question. As he had failed to pay the call, the company could and did
exercise an express power in its constitution to forfeit his shares, which was
undoubtedly given to secure members’ obligation to pay calls. The plaintiff brought
proceedings claiming that his failure to pay the call had been accidental due
to his absence from his home. Sir William Grant MR refused to give relief from
forfeiture. He held that if relief from forfeiture was given in such a
situation, the company could not carry on its business. He held, at p 434:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is essential, that the money
should be paid, and that they should know, what is their situation. Interest is
not an adequate compensation, even among individuals; much less in these
undertakings.”</p>

</span>If the company could not forfeit the shares, it would not know whether
it could cause the shares to be transferred to anyone else and make calls on
them, and it would not have the capital the call was supposed to raise.</a></p><a name="para80">

Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1997/5.html">[1997] AC 514</a>, which Lord Briggs
summarises at para 29 of his judgment. Lord Hoffmann summed up the point in
that case in the final sentence of the advice of the Privy Council by saying
that the case showed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the need for a firm restatement
of the principle that in cases of rescission of an ordinary contract of sale of
land for failure to comply with an essential condition as to time, equity will
not intervene.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82">82.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Private Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/185.html">[2011] 1 All ER (Comm) 259</a> (discussed by Lord Briggs at paras
33 and 51 above) into this category. Hamblen J there held that the grant of
relief from forfeiture of a lease of a chattel which would have significant
economic life after the expiry of the lease was outside existing authorities
dealing with chattels. He did not consider whether to extend authority because
he went on to hold that there was no jurisdiction to grant relief anyway
because the termination provision sought to be relieved was not for the
purposes of security for non-payment of rent and because time for payment was
of the essence of the agreement and the owner of the aircraft, which in that
case had a residual economic life, had a considerable interest in the timeous
performance of obligations and because the grant of relief would cause
considerable uncertainty generally (see judgment of Hamblen J at paras 72 to
80). Hamblen J distinguished the earlier case of <i>On Demand Information plc v
Michael Gerson (Finance) plc </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/13.html">[2003] 1 AC 368</a> (discussed by Lord Briggs at
para 32 above) on the basis that the lessee would retain the goods
indefinitely. The point in the <i>On Demand</i> case was that the lessees had
sold without giving the requisite notice and in those circumstances they were
required to pay to the hirer some 95% of the proceeds of sale which they had
obtained for the hired goods on a sale for which they had been unable to
complete the approval processes required under the contract. That was clearly a
situation in which equity had to intervene.</p>

contained re-entry clauses; but other instances are found in relation to copy holds,
or where the forfeiture was in the nature of a penalty. Although the principle
is well established, there has undoubtedly been some fluctuation of authority
as to the self-limitation to be imposed or accepted on this power.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84">84.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilberforce’s speech went on to describe the debates that had taken
place in the early 19th century on different issues. These differences of view
as to when equity should or should not grant relief show that the doctrine of
relief from forfeiture was not based on some generalised concept of
unconscionability but on a detailed and, as Lord Briggs describes it,
principled distinction between the different situations which might bring it
into contention:</a></p><a name="para84">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para84">“<span style="background:white">Yet
even this head of relief has not been uncontested: Lord Eldon LC in his
well-known judgment in <em>Hill v Barclay</em> (1811) 18 Ves Jun 56 expressed
his suspicion of it as a valid principle, pointing out, in an argument which
surely has much force, that there may be cases where to oblige acceptance of a
stipulated sum of money even with interest, at a date when receipt had lost its
usefulness, might represent an unjust variation of what had been contracted
for: see also <em>Reynolds v Pitt</em> (1812) 19 Ves Jun 140. Secondly, there
were the heads of fraud, accident, mistake or surprise, always a ground for
equity’s intervention, the inclusion of which entailed the exclusion of mere
inadvertence</span></a><a name="ORIGHIT_455"></a><a name="HIT_455"></a> and a fortiori of
wilful defaults.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Outside of these there remained a
debatable area in which were included obligations in leases such as to repair<a name="ORIGHIT_456"></a><a name="HIT_456"></a> and analogous obligations
concerning the condition of property, and<a name="ORIGHIT_457"></a><a name="HIT_457"></a> covenants to insure or not to assign. As to covenants to
repair<a name="ORIGHIT_458"></a><a name="HIT_458"></a> and cases of waste,
cases can be quoted before the 19th century in which relief was granted: see <em>Webber
v Smith</em> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1689/325.pdf">(1689) 2 Vern 103</a> and<a name="ORIGHIT_459"></a><a name="HIT_459"></a>
<em>Nash v Earl of Derby</em> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1705/28.pdf">(1705) 2 Vern 537</a>. There were hostile pronouncements.
In <em>Wadman v Calcroft</em> (1804) 10 Ves Jun 67 both Sir William Grant MR<a name="ORIGHIT_460"></a><a name="HIT_460"></a> and Lord Eldon LC are found
stating it to be clear that relief cannot be given against the breach of other
covenants - ie than covenants to pay rent.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">It was soon after that the critical
divide or supposed divide occurred, between the liberal view of Lord Erskine LC
in <em>Sanders v Pope</em> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1806/125.pdf">(1806) 12 Ves Jun 282</a><a name="ORIGHIT_461"></a><a name="HIT_461"></a> and the strict view of Lord Eldon LC in <em>Hill v Barclay</em>.
The latter case came to be followed as the true canon; the former was poorly
regarded in Lincoln’s Inn, but it is important to observe where the difference
lay. This was not, as I understand it, in any disagreement as to the field in
which relief might be granted, for both cases seem to have accepted that, in
principle, relief from forfeiture might be granted when the covenant was to lay
out a sum of money on property: but rather on whether equity would relieve
against a wilful breach.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85">85.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilberforce continued, at pp 723-724:</a></p><a name="para85">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para85">“[N]o decision in the present case
involves the establishment or recognition directly or by implication of any
general power - that is to say, apart from the special heads of fraud,
accident, mistake or surprise in courts exercising equitable jurisdiction to
relieve against men’s bargains. Lord Eldon LC’s firm denial of any such power
in <i>Hill v Barclay</i> does not call for any revision or review in this case.
Equally there is no need to qualify Kay LJ’s proposition in <i>Barrow v Isaacs
&amp; Son</i> [</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1890/192.html">[1891] 1 QB 417</a>]. I would fully endorse this: it remains true
today that equity expects men to carry out their bargains and will not let them
buy their way out by uncovenanted payment. But it is consistent with these
principles that we should reaffirm the right of courts of equity <i>in
appropriate<a name="ORIGHIT_466"></a><a name="HIT_466"></a> and limited cases</i>
to relieve against forfeiture for breach of covenant or condition where the
primary object of the bargain is to secure a stated result which can
effectively be attained when the matter comes before the court,<a name="ORIGHIT_467"></a><a name="HIT_467"></a> and where the forfeiture
provision is added by way of security for the production of that result. The
word ‘appropriate’ involves consideration of the conduct of the applicant for
relief, in particular whether his default was wilful, of the gravity of the
breaches,<a name="ORIGHIT_468"></a><a name="HIT_468"></a> and of the disparity
between the value of the property of which forfeiture is claimed as compared
with the damage caused by the breach.” (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86">86.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So, significantly, equity did not mend or relieve against people’s
bargains, and there were categories of cases in which equity did not grant
relief, not just individual cases where the discretion was exercised against
the grant of relief.</a></p><a name="para86">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I have explained, those appropriate and limited cases do not include
cases such as <i>The Scaptrade </i>[1983] 2 AC 694, <i>Union Eagle</i> and <i>Sparks</i>
where (outside leases of land and mortgages) it was inconsistent with the terms
of the parties’ bargain that there should be any relief from strict performance
of the contract if the other party chose to enforce his rights (always provided
that those terms were not unlawful, or for example unenforceable as penalties).
This is a basic principle of equity for several reasons, and a key element of
equity’s role in economically significant cases.</a></p><a name="para87">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>No unacceptable loss of certainty</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have raised the question whether there is an unacceptable loss of
certainty involved in applying the doctrine of relief from forfeiture where
rights were the subject of a licence. I answer that concern as follows. This
case does not alter the underlying approach of equity to claims for relief from
forfeiture. Even where the preconditions for forfeiture have been met, relief
will not be given if the case falls within one of the categories of case in
which equity does not intervene. The inappropriateness of relief from
forfeiture is most likely in “inconsistent with ordinary and lawful commercial
bargain” cases, in which the approach of the courts is clear. It is,
furthermore, not every type of licence which will be productive of rights in
respect of property, as in this case. Further, in this case, the licence was
prevented from being a lease only because it was perpetual and if it had been a
lease there is no doubt that there would have been jurisdiction to grant relief
from forfeiture. Moreover, the extension of the law in this case is a logical
development conducive of a coherent legal principle on the basis that the gap
between relief in relation to realty and relief in relation to personalty
should, as Lord Briggs has explained, be closed so far as possible. In summary,
the application of the doctrine to a right arising under a licence is a small
step, and it is, as I see it, unlikely to be the case that this development of
the law will turn out to involve any significant loss of certainty in what the
principle of relief from forfeiture stands for.</a></p><a name="para88">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The circumstances of the present case</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"></a><a name="para89">89.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Passing to the present case, the right given by clause 5 of the licence,
which appears to be an adaptation of the right of re-entry in a lease, was
intended to be a security for the payment of an annual sum of £50. Like Lord
Briggs, I consider that the judgment of Lewison LJ contained a most careful
analysis of the question whether the licence conferred a possessory right and
that there is no basis on which this court should interfere with that
conclusion.</a></p><a name="para89">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no appeal in this case against the exercise by HHJ Behrens of
his discretion to grant relief from forfeiture. Accordingly, on this appeal we
have not been concerned with the additional range of factors which the court
considers when exercising its discretion to grant relief from forfeiture. This
is a large subject and it should not be thought that, since these judgments do
not deal with it, it is not also an area of law in which there is a body of
authority.</a></p><a name="para90">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore also dismiss this appeal.</a></p><a name="para91">
