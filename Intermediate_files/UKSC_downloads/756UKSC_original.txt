Indeed, it is approaching 50 years since the last such appeal before the House of Lords - <i>The Savina</i> [1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 123.</a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal raises two important questions of construction of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 as amended (“the Collision Regulations”). Both questions relate to the application of the “crossing rules”, as set out in rules 15-17 of the Collision Regulations. These rules apply where two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve a risk of collision. They require the vessel which has the other on her starboard side to keep out of the way (the “give-way vessel”) whilst the other vessel is required to keep her course and speed (the “stand-on vessel”). They are of cardinal importance to the safety of navigation.</a></p><a name="para2"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question which the court has been asked is whether the crossing rules are inapplicable or are to be disapplied where an outbound vessel is navigating within a narrow channel and has a vessel on a crossing course approaching the narrow channel with the intention of and in preparation for entering it. This concerns the inter-relationship between the crossing rules and the “narrow channel rules” - rule 9. Rule 9(a) requires vessels proceeding along the course of a narrow channel to keep as near to its starboard outer limit as is safe and practicable.</a></p><a name="para3"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second question which arises is whether it is necessary for the putative give-way vessel to be on a steady course for the crossing rules to be engaged. The “putative give-way vessel” is the vessel which, if the crossing rules apply, would be required by rule 15 to keep out of the way of the other vessel. In practical terms it is the vessel which has the other vessel on her starboard side. We will call that other vessel the “putative stand-on vessel”.</a></p><a name="para4"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collision which gives rise to these questions was between the appellant’s large container vessel, <i>Ever Smart </i>(“EVER SMART”) and the respondent’s VLCC (very large crude carrier), <i>Alexandra 1</i> (“ALEXANDRA 1”). The collision took place within the pilot boarding area, just outside the dredged entrance/exit channel to the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates (“the channel”), at 2342:22 local time (GMT+4) on 11 February 2015. (The time of the collision is referred to hereafter as “C” and times leading up to the collision as “C-<i>x</i>”.) EVER SMART was outbound from Jebel Ali laden with 48,564 mt of containerised general cargo and, until shortly before the collision, was proceeding along the channel. ALEXANDRA 1 was the inbound vessel, laden with 113,915 mt of condensate, and was, although not stationary, waiting in the pilot boarding area to pick up a pilot being released from EVER SMART before entering the channel. The channel is a “narrow channel” for the purpose of rule 9.</a></p><a name="para5">

On this appeal the appellant contends that this interpretation of the Collision Regulations is wrong and does not give sufficient weight to the fundamental importance of the crossing rules in preventing collisions at sea.</a></p><a name="para6">

Bearing in mind that a narrow channel may include an appropriately narrow harbour entrance, the crossing situation to which the first question relates occurs very frequently, all round the world. As for the second question, there may be many reasons why a vessel which is moving over the ground may not be on a steady course, but nevertheless be approaching another vessel on a steady bearing and therefore with a risk of collision, as stated in rule 7(d)(i). It is a striking feature of the present case that, although ALEXANDRA 1 (which was the putative give-way vessel) was not on a steady course, she and EVER SMART were approaching each other on a steady bearing for the whole of the 23 minute period before the collision.</a></p><a name="para7">

Masthead lights are visible at a minimum distance of six miles and sidelights are visible at a minimum distance of three miles. ALEXANDRA 1, in addition, was displaying an all-round red light showing that she was carrying a dangerous cargo.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of the navigation of ALEXANDRA 1:</a></p><a name="para12"> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a laden tanker bound for Jebel Ali, ALEXANDRA 1 needed to embark her inbound pilot and then to enter the channel. She was underway from the anchorage and proceeding towards buoy No 1 at about 2247, having been informed by Jebel Ali Port Control that a pilot would be boarding at 2315 and to be at buoy No 1 at that time. Shortly afterwards (2254) she was advised by Jebel Ali Port Control that her pilot was on board the outbound EVER SMART, that EVER SMART would proceed up to buoy No 1, and that once she was clear ALEXANDRA 1 “can enter the channel”.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2315 (C-27) ALEXANDRA 1 was within the pilot boarding area about 1.4 nautical miles WNW of the No 1 buoys.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2318 (C-24) the engines of ALEXANDRA 1 were stopped and her helm was amidships. Her speed over the ground was 2.3 knots, her course made good (ie over the ground) was 126 degrees and her heading 110 degrees. At about this time, those on board ALEXANDRA 1 observed EVER SMART proceeding outbound along the channel. At that time, EVER SMART would have been between Nos 6 and 7 buoys.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2320 (C-22), a starboard helm order was given although this was followed by an amidships order.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2327 (C-15) ALEXANDRA 1’s engines were put from stop to dead slow ahead. Her speed through the water was 1.3 knots and began to increase. She was now about 1 mile WNW of the No 1 buoys.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2328 (C-14) her master overheard a conversation between Port Control and the tugboat ZAKHEER BRAVO. The tug was towing a barge and requested permission to pass the pilot station from west to east en route to Jumeirah. Port Control asked if the tug could see a waiting tanker and she replied that it was on her starboard bow. Port Control advised her to proceed at least one mile astern of the tanker.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master misunderstood the conversation and thought that Port Control was speaking to EVER SMART and that EVER SMART would be attempting to pass one mile astern of ALEXANDRA 1. This caused the Master concern as he feared that if ALEXANDRA 1 went around buoy No 1 there would be a “fucking crunch” at the entrance to the channel.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2331 (C-11), ALEXANDRA 1 stopped her engines and put them to dead slow ahead again at 2332 (C-10). She was now about nine cables WNW of No 1 buoys, her speed over the ground was 1.8 knots, her course made good was 101 degrees and her heading 97 degrees.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2335 (C-7) her master observed the pilot vessel alongside the port side of EVER SMART and that the latter’s speed had fallen. He compared EVER SMART to a “Mercedes” and ALEXANDRA 1 to “a hog on ice, with no skates”. Shortly afterwards, the pilot vessel was observed leaving EVER SMART.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2337 (C-5) ALEXANDRA 1 was approaching the point at which she would normally have turned to line up with the starboard side of the approaches to the channel. However, she did not do so due to the mistaken understanding of the conversation between Port Control and ZAKHEER BRAVO at C-14. At this stage her speed over the ground was 2.1 knots, her course made good was 106 degrees and her heading 92 degrees.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2338 (C-4), the engines of ALEXANDRA 1 were put from dead slow ahead to slow ahead. The Master expressed concern that it was about the time to turn into the channel between No 1 buoys. At this stage her speed over the ground was 2.2 knots, her course made good was about 102 degrees and her heading about 90 degrees.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2340 (C-2) the Master of ALEXANDRA 1 observed EVER SMART abeam of No 1 buoys but was not turning to port as he had expected. Her engines were put to full astern, but this had little effect on her speed which was 2.3 knots over the ground at this time, increasing to 2.5 knots over the ground by C-1. At this stage her course made good was about 92 degrees and her heading 93 degrees.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xiii)&nbsp;&nbsp; At C-1, the Master called Port Control and advised it that EVER SMART was not changing course and that there would be a collision.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xiv)&nbsp;&nbsp; At C-30 seconds, her engines were put to dead slow astern. Her master told EVER SMART by VHF to go hard to starboard and switched on the deck lights of ALEXANDRA 1.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a minute after the collision, her master said to Port Control, “he’s not following your rules ... you told him to go to my stern”.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EVER SMART left the container terminal at 2230 with a pilot on board, proceeding along the channel at full ahead (manoeuvring) until about C-11. Her course and speed over the ground were 313 degrees - 314 degrees (true) and about 12.9 knots respectively.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the vessel passed No 6 buoys to No 4 buoys (C-20 to C-14) EVER SMART was proceeding in about mid-channe1.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2331 (C-11) her engines were reduced to half ahead and at C-10 to slow ahead as she passed No 3 buoys slightly to port of mid-channel.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2332 (C-10) until collision, EVER SMART was navigating to port of mid-channel and thus on the wrong side of the channel in breach of rule 9.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2333 (C-9) her pilot advised the Master to proceed at 10 knots and to keep a course of 314 degrees over the ground. He also advised that there was a vessel (ALEXANDRA 1) to port and that the Master should take care. At this time EVER SMART’s speed over the ground and course made good were respectively 12.2 knots and 312 degrees.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 2334 (C-8) her engines were reduced to dead slow ahead to enable the pilot to disembark, and the Master ordered a course of 319 degrees to be steered. Her radar, which had been on relative motion, was switched to north up display.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2336 (C-6) the pilot had disembarked, having advised EVER SMART before leaving the bridge to proceed at 10 knots, to keep a course of 314 degrees over the ground, that there was a vessel to port and to take care. The pilot vessel moved ahead of EVER SMART to meet ALEXANDRA 1. EVER SMART was passing No 2 buoys.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp; At C-5 her speed was increased to half ahead and then full ahead (C-4) and shortly afterwards to full sea speed (C-<span style="color:black">3½</span>). The vessel’s speed over the ground increased to 9.5 knots at about (C-5), 11.8 knots at about (C-1) and was 12.4 knots at the time of collision. She passed No 1 buoys at about 2340 (C-2).</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At C-30 seconds, Port Control contacted EVER SMART to ask if she was clearing to starboard. At about the same time both the pilot (still on board the pilot boat) and the Master of ALEXANDRA 1 instructed EVER SMART to go hard to starboard. Her master then ordered hard to starboard. Very shortly before the collision, the Master of EVER SMART said “what’s that?”.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than two minutes after the collision the Master of EVER SMART said (apparently to the officer of the watch and helmsman) “both of you ... have you seen it or not?” He then said “how come you didn’t see it?”.</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(xi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about C+6 the Master of EVER SMART reported the collision to his owners saying “We hit her ... because she stopped outside waiting, we were leaving the port, we did not see that ... I saw the light, but didn’t know she was transverse, so we knock against her bow”.</p>

The port bow of EVER SMART struck the starboard bow of ALEXANDRA 1 at an angle of about 40 degrees leading aft on EVER SMART. At collision the speed and course of EVER SMART over the ground was 12.4 knots and 316.0 degrees (true) and her heading was 323.9 degrees (true). The speed and course of ALEXANDRA 1 over the ground was respectively 2.4 knots and 104.4 degrees (true) and her heading was 101.2 degrees (true).

He stated as follows at para 70:</a></p><a name="para23"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… The agreed schedule shows that from C-26 until C-23 her course over the ground varied from 119 to 127 degrees (altering to starboard), from C-23 until C-12 her course over the ground varied from 127 to 81 degrees (altering to port), from C-12 until C-7 her course over the ground varied from 81 to 115 degrees (altering to starboard) and from C-7 until C-1.5 her course over the ground varied from 115 to 91 degrees (altering to port). During that same period her heading also varied; from C-26 until C-14 her heading varied from 112 to 84 degrees (altering to port), from C-14 until C-8 her heading altered from 84 to 100 degrees (altering to starboard) and from C-8 until C-3 her heading altered from 100 to 90 degrees (altering to port). This variation of course made good and of heading was no doubt caused by the circumstance that ALEXANDRA I was proceeding very slowly (about 1-2 knots over the ground). At such a slow speed ALEXANDRA I was not very manoeuvrable. Nevertheless she made progress in a broadly east south easterly direction towards the entrance of the channel as she waited to embark the pilot. Was she on a sufficiently constant direction or heading to be on a course? I do not consider that she was. Her ‘course made good’ varied between 81 and 127 degrees (and her heading varied between 84 and 112 degrees). It is difficult to describe that as ‘a course’ (though her preliminary act describes her as being on an east south easterly course). I would describe her as maintaining a broadly east or east south easterly heading as she waited for the pilot vessel to approach. That required her to have some, but not very much, way on. I would describe ALEXANDRA I as waiting for the pilot vessel to arrive rather than being on a course. Had a good lookout been kept on board EVER SMART from C-21 until collision it would have been apparent that ALEXANDRA I had moved less than a mile. It would or ought to have been obvious that she was waiting to embark a pilot.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Did good seamanship require ALEXANDRA I to keep a certain minimum distance from buoys No 1 so long as EVER SMART was still in the dredged channel and if so what was that distance?”</p>

Their reasons for so concluding are summarised at para 74 as follows:</a></p><a name="para31"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Pulling the threads together on authority in the situation where one vessel is approaching a narrow channel intending to enter it and the other vessel is navigating in the narrow channel intending to exit it:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom: 26.0pt;margin-left:108.0pt">i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in agreement with Teare J, I regard the observations of both Hewson J and Lord Clarke as powerfully persuasive, supporting the inapplicability of the crossing rules in the present situation. I do not think that either <i>The Canberra</i> <i>Star</i> or<i> Kulemesin</i> is meaningfully distinguishable.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I respectfully agree with the reasons given by Teare J, Hewson J and Lord Clarke. As already discussed, the risk of potentially different actions being required at the same time is thereby avoided; this is not a situation where it is necessary to apply the crossing rules to secure safe navigation - and if it is not necessary to apply the crossing rules it can fairly be said that it is necessary <i>not</i> to apply them, so as to avoid adding a layer of confusion.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the view upheld in <i>The Canberra Star</i>, <i>Kulemesin</i> and by the Judge, ensures continuity and a seamless entry into the channel, as explained in <i>Kulemesin</i>. It is to be underlined that in the present case the entrance to and exit from the narrow channel were in the pilot boarding area and that at all material times ALEXANDRA I was manoeuvring in that area.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, with respect, like Hewson J, I am wary of over-generalising. On the facts here, I am persuaded that the crossing rules did not apply. Any rule of law in this regard must be limited to factually indistinguishable or materially similar situations. Beyond that, I would not go and, reading the judgment as a whole, I do not think the Judge went either.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion was “stress-tested” by considering a hypothetical East-West situation with the incoming vessel approaching the channel from the East so that it had to cross over to the starboard side of the channel to prepare for entry. It was EVER SMART’s case that the crossing rules must apply in such a case as otherwise there would be no rule of priority. The Elder Brethren were asked to consider what actions would be expected from a prudent mariner in accordance with the ordinary practice of seamen on the outbound and inbound vessel in such circumstances. Their answer set out various steps they considered that the prudent mariner should take to avoid any risk of collision. In relation to the outbound vessel this included keeping a sharp look out, ensuring compliance with rule 9 by staying on the starboard side of the channel, acquiring the inbound vessel as an ARPA target, consulting the onboard pilot and port control about the inbound vessel’s intentions, making early VHF contact with the other vessel and being prepared to adjust speed to resolve close quarter/collision risk if necessary. In relation to the incoming vessel this included matters such as keeping a sharp lookout, approaching via the fairway buoy, acquiring information about pilot boarding time and position, acquiring the outbound vessel as an ARPA target and keeping a close watch on the vessel’s bearing to determine the risk of collision, and identifying and making early VHF contact with the outbound vessel.</a></p><a name="para32">

As Gross LJ stated at para 84:</a></p><a name="para33"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… The Elder Brethren were, of course, concerned with seamanship not matters of law. But it is plain from the Answer that the Elder Brethren did not consider the crossing rules to have any role to play in the hypothetical East-West situation. To my mind, the Answer provides a comprehensive, realistic guide to safe navigation for both vessels, according to the requirements of good seamanship, and governed by rules 2 and 9. The attraction of the rule of priority under the crossing rules is understandable but less than compelling in the situation with which we are concerned. In my judgment, the Answer reflects the practical reality of good seamanship, within this port area ...”</p>

Gross LJ considered that this conclusion was supported by observations made in various authorities as well as the decision of Brandon J in <i>The Avance</i> [1979] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 143. He reasoned as follows at para 92:</a></p><a name="para34"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Though the position may not be as obvious as in the case of the stand-on vessel, I am nonetheless satisfied that both vessels, the give-way vessel included, must be on sufficiently defined courses for the crossing rules to apply. That is of the essence of the crossing rules. The need for an appreciation of the situation is not confined to the give-way vessel; the stand-on vessel must be in a position to appreciate her own status as such - and, additionally may be required to make a judgment call in the light of the action taken by the give-way vessel: rule 17(a)(ii) and (3). The mere fact that there was a risk of collision through convergence, is not determinative of whether the crossing rules apply. Put colloquially (in Ms Selvaratnam’s words), it takes two to cross.”</p>

None of them is expressly defined in the Collision Regulations. They are however words with a relatively settled meaning among mariners, as may be gathered from published nautical manuals and glossaries, and which it may be supposed that the Rules take for granted. The usage which follows has been checked with, and confirmed by, the Nautical Assessors, and is not a matter of controversy between the parties.</a></p><a name="para47">

But for present purposes we think it better (and the Nautical Assessors agree) to distinguish between them as follows. The heading of a vessel is the direction (expressed as a point or number of degrees on a compass) in which she is pointing at a particular moment in time. So, for example, a vessel is on a heading of North if a horizontal line projected from a compass on her centre point through her bow points North. Used in that sense, a vessel does not have to be moving to have a heading.</a></p><a name="para48"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The course of a vessel is the direction, again expressed by reference to the points or degrees of a compass, in which she is moving. This may be through the water or over the ground. Course over the ground is sometimes called the course made good, so as to distinguish it from her course through the water. The judge uses course over the ground and course made good interchangeably. It is the course over the ground rather than the course through the water that matters for present purposes, as para 70 of the judge’s judgment makes clear. We use “course” in that sense. Where there is no wind or current the course of a vessel both through the water and over the ground may well be the same as her heading. She simply moves in the direction in which she is pointed. But this will not necessarily be so, as the Nautical Assessors have confirmed and the present case illustrates. Tidal stream, current, surface drift and wind, if present, will or may cause her course over the ground to be different from both her heading and her course through the water. Thus a vessel heading North in an Easterly current will be on a course over the ground which is East of North, the amount of the Easterly element being the product of the ratio between her speed (through the water) and the rate of the current. Broadly speaking, the slower the vessel’s speed and the faster the current, the greater will be the difference between her heading and her course over the ground. The significant difference between the heading and course over the ground of the slow-moving ALEXANDRA 1 in the present case is a good illustration.</a></p><a name="para49">

This is almost invariably true of a sailing vessel (unless the wind is blowing from right astern) but can also be true of power-driven vessels such as high-sided container ships, as the judge noted had probably happened to the EVER SMART in the present case. Since wind is described (unlike current) by reference to where it is coming from, a vessel heading North may have her course deflected East by a Westerly wind. Leeway will produce a difference between a vessel’s heading and her course through the water. Sometimes leeway and current will act together to increase the difference between heading and course over the ground. Sometimes they may cancel each other out.</a></p><a name="para50">

More generally course may be used to describe the overall progress of the vessel over a period of time, which may accommodate changes in her heading and speed. As explained below a vessel may be said to maintain her course despite significant changes in heading and speed, measured at particular moments in time. Thus for example a vessel or a convoy proceeding along a zig zag pattern in wartime will nonetheless intend and achieve an overall specific course towards its destination, as will a vessel moving or “yawing” either side of an intended course in a rough sea: see <i>The Queen Mary</i> (1949) 82 Ll L Rep 303.</a></p><a name="para51">

Bearing is an expression with various maritime meanings, but for present purposes compass bearing is the meaning which matters. It is the direction in which one vessel appears when viewed from another at a particular moment in time, expressed again in terms of the points or degrees of a compass. This is the way in which “compass bearing” is used in rule 7(d)(i). When vessel A takes a series of compass bearings of vessel B over time, and they do not appreciably change, vessel B is generally described as being on a steady bearing from vessel A. As the Nautical Assessors have confirmed, the compass bearing of one vessel from another may generally be measured with reasonable precision, by day or by night by radar and, when the vessels are in sight of each other, assessed visually by using a compass.</a></p><a name="para52">

This is the direction in which one vessel appears from the other, measured (usually now in degrees) as an angle from the viewing vessel’s heading, from zero (dead ahead) to 180 (dead astern). In what follows, and in most of the reported cases, “bearing” is used as meaning compass bearing, in conformity with rule 7(d).</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“On these facts, I think it is perfectly plain that at some time these vessels came under the duties of ships crossing on courses involving risk of collision. Witnesses from each of the ships said that over a substantial period the bearing of the other ship remained constant. That, as is well known, is an infallible warning to mariners that the vessels were approaching with risk of collision.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">See also the description of the facts in <i>The Otranto</i> [1931] AC 194. This is traditionally ascertained by each vessel by taking a series of bearings of the other vessel over a period of time, using a compass. It is also observable by regular inspection of radar. The bearing of vessel A from vessel B will necessarily be the reciprocal of the bearing of vessel B from vessel A. Thus if vessel A bears South (180 degrees) from vessel B, then vessel B must bear North (000 degrees) from vessel A. By definition, if vessel A’s bearing from vessel B does not appreciably change, the same will be true of vessel B’s bearing from vessel A.</p>

In this context “approaching” simply means getting nearer. It does not necessarily mean heading towards each other. For example, a vessel being overtaken may be heading directly away from the overtaking vessel, but if they are each on a steady bearing from the other there is nonetheless a risk of collision because they are getting nearer to each other. Rule 7(d)(i) does not make a steady compass bearing the only indicator of a risk of collision: see eg rule 7(a), (b) and (d)(ii). But nor is it merely a rebuttable presumption. Wherever it applies, the risk of collision must be taken to exist.</a></p><a name="para55">

Rules 13 and 14 deal respectively with vessels on substantially the same or reciprocal courses. Rule 13 (the overtaking rule) provides that, in an overtaking situation, the overtaking vessel must keep clear of the vessel being overtaken. Rule 14 (the head-on rule) provides that two vessels approaching each other on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to create a risk of collision must each turn to starboard. Each of those rules contains precise specifications which triggers its application: see rules 13(b) and 14(b). In order to make them work clearly at night, the lighting rules, and rule 21 in particular, operate precisely in tandem with those triggering specifications. Rule 13(b), which triggers the overtaking rule, applies whenever the overtaking vessel is more than 22.5 degrees abaft the beam of the overtaken vessel. The courses of the two vessels may well be crossing, but rule 13 overrides the crossing rules where it applies: see rule 13(a).</a></p><a name="para56">

It provides as follows:</a></p><a name="para57"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In this context “crossing” simply means that their courses are not parallel but intersecting: ie that the lines representing the probable future course of each will intersect at some point. That of itself may not create a risk of collision. The seas are full of vessels on crossing courses which come nowhere near each other. But if they are approaching each other and the bearings of each, taken from the other, do not appreciably change, then there will be a risk of collision. Unless one of them keeps clear of the other, the two vessels will be likely to meet each other and collide. That is what rule 7(d)(i) provides in express terms. Although couched in terms of “deeming” this is not a deeming contrary to the facts. It is factually true as well. That is why it is described as an “infallible warning” of a risk of collision in <i>The Aracelio Iglesias</i>.</p>

They each apply wherever the rules identify which vessel is to keep out of the way.

It is abrogated when it appears to the stand-on vessel that the give-way vessel is not complying with the Rules: see rule 17(a)(ii), or when action by both vessels has become necessary to avoid a collision: see rule 17(b). The abrogation of the stand-on vessel’s obligation does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep clear: see rule 17(d).

If the nautical manoeuvre upon which she is visibly engaged when she becomes the stand-on vessel involves altering her heading or course, or slowing down, she may do so without undermining the obligation of the give-way vessel to keep clear. She may for example be altering course or slowing down to pick up a pilot: see <i>The Roanoke</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpPro/1908/12.html">[1908] P 231</a>. At p 242 Farwell LJ explains the purpose of the obligation of the stand-on vessel:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“So to hold [<i>that such a change of speed or course by the stand-on vessel relieves the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep clear</i>] would be to shift the duty of keeping out of the way from the giving-way vessel to the other, and would make article 21 [<i>now rule 17</i>] read as if the latter vessel were bound to keep her course and speed ‘so as to keep out of the way of the giving-way vessel’, instead of ‘so as to enable the giving-way vessel to keep out of her way’, which is, in my opinion, the true construction.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>The Taunton</i> (1928) 31 Ll L Rep 119, the stand-on vessel was an old sailing ketch, struggling across the Bristol Channel in a very strong cross-current, occasionally substantially altering her heading to avoid being swept down from her destination in Cardiff Roads. She was held not to have failed to keep her course and speed. Scrutton LJ said, at p 120:</a></p><a name="para63"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The decisions of this Court have thrown a light on that rule which perhaps one would not derive from the rule if one did not know anything about the decisions, because they have said that when the rule talks about keeping course and speed it means the course you were going to take for the object you had in view - not the course and speed you had at any particular moment. So you keep your speed although you stop, and you keep your course although you alter it 16 points. You keep your course if you are going round the bend of a river although you are altering it to follow the bend. You keep your speed although you stop to pick up a pilot. It follows that if you are crossing the tide your course is to keep diverging: and, therefore, according to the authorities, you are keeping your course although you are continually porting.”</p>

First the “object you had in view” must be reasonably apparent to the give-way vessel, if the purpose of the obligation to keep course and speed, as explained in <i>The Roanoke</i>, is to have effect. Secondly, the “object … in view” must include, or take account of, the stand-on vessel’s obligation to comply with the other provisions of the Rules. This may include avoiding a collision with a third vessel, which may be approaching the stand-on vessel head-on, or complying with the narrow channel rule in rule 9(a) to keep to the starboard side of the channel, as is implicit in Scrutton LJ’s example of turning to follow a bend in a river.</a></p><a name="para64">

We regard this approach to rule 2 as being misconceived. First, it is plain from rule 2(a) that compliance with the Rules is a first principle of good seamanship. The same priority appears in rule 8(a). As stated in <i>Marsden &amp; Gault on Collisions at Sea</i>, 14th ed, para 5-103, rule 2(a) “merely reminds seamen of the adverse consequences of failure to comply with the rules or with the practice of good seamanship”. In <i>The Queen Mary</i> ([1949] 82 Ll L Rep 303, 341), Lord MacDermott said:</a></p><a name="para66"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my opinion, it is not aimed at authorising departure from the regulations, and I doubt if it is more than a solemn warning that compliance therewith does not terminate the ever present duty of using reasonable skill and care.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, rule 2(b) builds in an inherent flexibility to meet particular dangers and special circumstances which points away from an approach which simply disapplies a Rule as a matter of construction because, on particular facts, strict compliance may give rise to difficulties. Rule 2(b) contemplates not the disapplication of a Rule as a matter of construction, but justifies a limited departure from its requirements, and only in particular circumstances which meet the stern test of necessity to avoid immediate danger. As stated at para 5-127 in <i>Marsden and Gault on Collisions at Sea</i>, 14th ed (2016), citing <i>The Concordia and Esther</i> (1866) LR 1 A &amp; E 93:</a></p><a name="para67"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To justify a departure from the regulations which is alleged to have been necessary to avoid immediate danger, there must be clear proof that an adherence to them would have caused such danger, and the action taken must be in accordance with the requirements of good seamanship.”</p>

First, the crossing rules lie at the heart of the scheme for avoiding collisions where two moving vessels are approaching each other on a steady bearing (other than dead ahead or astern) and are thereby at risk of collision. They apply wherever the vessels are not head-on and one is not overtaking the other. Both those exceptions are precisely defined. Since the obvious purpose of the crossing rules is to prevent collisions in such circumstances it follows that, as a matter of construction, they should not lightly be treated as inapplicable. On the contrary they should be applied unless there is some necessity to do otherwise. This was stated as a principle by Lord Wright in <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> at p 250 (at a time when the crossing rules were contained in articles 19 and 21 of the then Collision Regulations):</a></p><a name="para68"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… wherever possible articles 19 and 21 ought to be applied and strictly enforced because they tend to secure safe navigation.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, a perceived tension between the obligation of the stand-on vessel under the crossing rules to keep her course and speed and the obligation of that vessel to comply with some other rule is unlikely to be a good reason for treating the crossing rules as wholly disapplied. Rather that tension is more likely, and appropriately, to be resolved by treating the stand-on obligation as moulded for the purpose of permitting compliance with the other rule, leaving the give-way vessel’s obligation to keep well clear in full force. This is reinforced by rule 17(d).</a></p><a name="para69">

If one Rule (here the crossing rules) is to be treated as ousted by another Rule (here the narrow channel rules) in the absence of any express provision to that effect, and there is none, then that ouster should be strictly limited to the minimum strictly necessary to avoid danger or uncertainty. An apparent tension with the dictates of good seamanship is no sufficient substitute.</a></p><a name="para70">

Radar was in general use on most commercial vessels, but not on many yachts, when the Collision Regulations took their current form in 1972. In its simplest form it provides a bearing of another vessel in much the same way as a compass, but also provides accurate ranging, so as reliably to inform one vessel when another is approaching. Radar may, if effectively used, also provide further information. For example, when “targeted” on a particular vessel, ARPA will, based on radar information, generate its course made good (ie over the ground) and can be set to provide a collision warning. AIS is based not on radar but on the GPS system. When in operation it transmits a vessel’s name, position, course and speed, whence it can be received by other AIS fitted vessels and, again, used to generate its range and bearing, and also its likely course, CPA (closest point of approach) and even an audible collision warning.</a></p><a name="para71">

Thus, as has been noted in para 46 above, the Steering Rules only apply as between vessels in visual (rather than radar) sight of each other, and the basic method by which a risk of collision between approaching vessels is to be identified continues to be the repeated observation of the other vessel’s compass bearing over time, rather than, for example, the other vessel’s course or its CPA: see rule 7(d)(i).</a></p><a name="para72">

If a generally applicable rule of construction of a Rule or Rules is to be laid down, it must be capable of being implemented by all vessels, as defined. Furthermore it can happen that one or more of these modern technical aids may not be operational or switched on. Thus reliance on these systems is not a complete substitute for visual observation and repeated compass bearings taken by using a fixed or (on small vessels) hand-bearing (ie hand-held) compass. In the present case, the AIS on ALEXANDRA 1 was inoperative possibly due to a vibration problem, while on EVER SMART the ARPA was targeted on the pilot launch, rather than on the ALEXANDRA 1, right up to the moment of collision. But both vessels were perfectly capable of taking bearings of each other, by compass or by radar.</a></p><a name="para73">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As the Crossing Rule applies to <i>Vessels in sight of one another</i> the importance of maintaining a good visual lookout is vital. While the risk of collision can be determined by radar, the repeated taking of visual bearings of an approaching vessel not only allows an assessment of whether that vessel remains on a steady bearing to be made, but also enables changes in aspect to be noted.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… We agree with the[ir] Justices perception that radar on its own (ie, without using ARPA etc) may assist by providing the range as well as bearing of the observed vessel. However, the effective use of Radar to assist in collision avoidance depends on the operator understanding the different modes of operation of the radar (true motion/relative motion/ground stabilised/sea stabilised) and their effect on assessing relative/true motion of raw radar data. The raw radar will allow an assessment of closest point of approach including indicating whether the observed vessel is on a steady bearing. However, raw radar may not indicate changes in aspect/course or speed unless they are large enough to significantly alter the observed relative motion between the two vessels. This means that the regular visual observation of the approaching vessel is key.”</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-style: normal">VII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question 2: are the crossing rules applicable only if the putative give-way vessel is on a steady course?</span></b></p>

This may be because it was an argument raised orally in closing submissions, and not subjected to detailed legal analysis at the trial, although it was in the Court of Appeal.

She may be manoeuvring through a crowded anchorage, or to pick up a pilot. She may be moving so slowly as not to answer precisely to her rudder. She may be altering her heading so as to cope with a strong tide, or she may be lying with her engines stopped and her rudder secured, drifting here and there under the influence of the wind. She may be waiting to enter a narrow channel, or a harbour, with her engines stopped, but nonetheless moving over the ground under the influence of wind or tide. She may simply be a yacht under power with an inattentive helmsman. The question is important because, if there is such a steady course requirement before the crossing rules are engaged, the putative give-way vessel may in any of those situations be relieved of what would otherwise be her obligation to keep well clear of the putative stand-on vessel, even though there is a deemed risk of collision. As stated in rule 7(d)(i) there is such a deemed risk of collision where two vessels are approaching each other on a compass bearing that does not appreciably change, regardless whether either of them is on a steady course.</a></p><a name="para76">

They demonstrate that ALEXANDRA 1 was, throughout, moving over the ground very slowly, in a general East South Easterly direction. But she was altering her heading between 84 and 112 degrees and her course made good (ie over the ground) between 81 and 127 degrees. She was also altering her speed. He concluded that she was “waiting” for the pilot launch to approach, before entering the narrow channel. Ms Selvaratnam QC for the respondent submitted that the judge found as a fact that ALEXANDRA 1 was not on a course at all. Certainly he used some words to that effect, for example at para 70, contrasting being “on a course” with merely “waiting” as if the two were (contrary to our view and a number of authorities) the antithesis of each other. But the facts he found about her movement (to use a neutral word) are as summarised at the beginning of this paragraph and are not in dispute. Bearing in mind that rule 15 does not use the word “course”, the question whether that movement constitutes a course is a semantic question. For present purposes it is sufficient that, for the relevant period of just under half an hour before the collision, (i) ALEXANDRA 1 was moving over the ground in a generally ESE direction; (ii) she and EVER SMART were approaching each other; and (iii) they were doing so on a compass bearing (each as measurable from the other) that did not appreciably change. Since they were neither head-on nor was either overtaking the other, they were therefore “crossing so as to involve a risk of collision” within the meaning of rule 15.</a></p><a name="para77">

This is because the change in bearing which an alteration in course would otherwise cause on its own may be cancelled out by a change in her speed, or by a change in either the course or (as here) the speed of the other vessel. As this case graphically demonstrates, a vessel on an unsteady course may still be crossing another’s course on a steady bearing, with a consequential risk of collision.</a></p><a name="para80">

Lights will readily disclose a change in the aspect presented by the other vessel either side of dead-ahead, when pairs of masthead lights converge and cross, and the exposed side light changes from red to green (or vice versa). A change in aspect either side of 22.5 degrees abaft the beam is also readily observable, because at that point the masthead and side lights are extinguished and replaced by the stern light (or vice versa). In such cases a change in the aspect presented by the observed vessel may give warning of a change in her course, and a lack of change may warn of a steady course. But significant changes of aspect may not easily be observable, and a lack of visible change in aspect may not be a reliable indicator of a steady course. Even in daylight, an observed change in the other vessel’s aspect may not be a reliable indicator of a change in her course. The change in her aspect may be caused or contributed to by the movement of the observing vessel. If the observed vessel is proceeding slowly in a strong or variable tidal stream and/or wind even a change in her apparent heading may not point to a change in her course. In sharp contrast, an appreciable change in the bearing of the observed vessel, or the lack of it, may readily be observed, using a compass or radar. In this context the Nautical Assessors have specifically confirmed that:</a></p><a name="para81">

But this cannot be so.

Save in a head-on situation, where neither vessel has right of way over the other, it is inherently safer for two vessels at risk of collision to know which must keep clear of the other, than for each to have to take seamanlike but otherwise unspecified avoiding action without knowing what the other vessel is likely to do.

The most important decision for this purpose is <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1949/1949_11.html">[1949] AC 236</a>, a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada. It was the sole authority relied upon by the judge for the conclusion that the crossing rules did not apply because ALEXANDRA 1 was not on a steady or, as he put it, “sufficiently defined” course to engage rule 15. But it is necessary to start earlier, with <i>The Ada and the Sappho</i> (1873) 2 Asp (NS) 4. The two named vessels were both inbound to the Humber, roughly at right angles to each other, with the Sappho on the Ada’s starboard bow. They were each, to the knowledge of the other, intending to stop to pick up pilots at the same point at the river-mouth, where the pilot vessel was moored. The crossing rules were held to apply, so that the Ada should have given way to the Sappho. Giving the judgment of the Board, Sir J W Colvile said at p 5:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It appears to their Lordships on the evidence that when first sighted the <i>Ada</i> had the other vessel on her starboard bow, and therefore, if they were crossing vessels, it was her duty to keep out of the way of the <i>Sappho</i>. Now their Lordships think that they were crossing vessels within the meaning of the rule, because both were of necessity directing their courses to one point. That point would be the point of intersection of the two courses if prolonged.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The key word in that passage is “of necessity”. Both vessels had to pick up a pilot at the same point, so there was a crossing with risk of collision. It did not matter whether the two vessels were steering steady courses. It was apparent from the need to pick up a pilot that their courses would intersect at the same point, and at much the same time.</p>

It was another case of two vessels proceeding to the same spot to pick up a pilot, in this case outside Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were again each approaching the other at right angles, with the Albano on the starboard side of the Parisian. The Parisian got there first and had almost stopped by the time of the collision. The Albano, although by then going full astern, hit the side of the Parisian, even though the latter had, at the very last moment, put her engines full ahead to try and cross the Albano’s approaching bow. Reversing the courts below, the Privy Council held that the crossing rules applied, notwithstanding that the Parisian was by the time of the collision almost stationary, waiting for her pilot, so that the Parisian should have kept clear. In passing Sir Gorell Barnes, giving the judgment of the Board, cited with approval the following passage from the judgment of Lord St Helier in <i>The Pekin</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1897/26.html">[1897] AC 532</a>, 536-537:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If at any time two vessels, not end on, are seen, keeping the courses to be expected with regard to them respectively, to be likely to arrive at the same point at or nearly at the same moment, they are vessels crossing so as to involve a risk of collision, but they are not so crossing if the course which is reasonably to be attributed to either vessel would keep her clear of the other. The question, therefore, always turns on the reasonable inference to be drawn as to a vessel’s future course from her position at a particular moment, and this greatly depends on the nature of the locality where she is at the moment.”</p>

In the latter case the collision occurred in the fairway of the Bedford Basin, part of Halifax Harbour, during the Second World War, when Halifax was being used as an assembly point for transatlantic convoys. The Basin is a large, deep, oval stretch of sheltered water several miles long, lying roughly North South, with an exit at the South Eastern end, leading to the Atlantic. The fairway<i> </i>(which does not appear to have been a narrow channel)<i> </i>ran from the NNW to the SSE to the exit. There were heavily congested anchorages to the West of the fairway, and a de-gaussing range (where the magnetic signature of vessels could be tested and corrected to minimise exposure to magnetic mines) to the East of the fairway. The Rambler, working as an ammunition ship and, together with escort launches, flying flags warning other vessels to keep clear, was proceeding to sea down the fairway. The Norefjord was seeking to proceed from the congested anchorage to the de-gaussing range, taking what the Board regarded as a thoroughly dangerous short cut across the fairway, on a constantly curving course, her hull hidden until the last moment from the Rambler by the numerous other ships in the anchorage through which the Norefjord was weaving her way. The Rambler had the Norefjord on her starboard side throughout, so the Norefjord was the putative stand-on vessel if the crossing rules applied. There was no opportunity for those navigating the Rambler to take bearings of the Norefjord. When her mastheads first became visible, the Rambler stopped engines, although at that stage it could not be seen whether the Norefjord was making for the exit, not involving crossing the Rambler’s course, or crossing the fairway, which would or might. As soon as the Norefjord’s hull became visible the Rambler went full astern. But this was only one and a half minutes before the collision.</a></p><a name="para90">

By the time that this became apparent, less than two minutes before the collision, it was too late for the remedy provided by the crossing rules to be of any use, and in any event the Rambler did all she then could to avoid the collision by going full astern. Meanwhile the Norefjord was making the Rambler’s task of ascertaining her intentions even more difficult by apparently turning to port while sounding one short blast (the signal for turning to starboard). Worse still, the Norefjord did nothing to avoid or even minimise the impending collision until the very last moment.</a></p><a name="para91">

At p 250 he referred to the “critical test for inferring that the vessel is on a course” as being “that her bearing does not alter”. By “course” he is here clearly meaning a crossing course. Whether the bearing does not alter, depends, he said, upon being able to keep the other vessel under observation for a sufficient time. He continued:</a></p><a name="para92"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It may often not be possible in narrow or congested waters: in the present case it could not be applied in regard to the Norefjord.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">After referring to cases which establish that the crossing rules may apply notwithstanding deviation from the ship’s course, he concluded:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“They also illustrate the importance attached to the necessity of attributing to the give-way ship actual or imputed knowledge of the situation. In the present case there was no obvious or ordinary manoeuvre which would give knowledge to the <i>Rambler</i>, so that quite apart from the difficulty inherent in a curved course, the case could not be held to be a case of crossing vessels because the necessary knowledge of the situation could not be ascribed to the <i>Rambler</i>. In any event, the <i>Rambler</i> took the correct action at the proper time.”</p>

If by this is meant a steadily crossing course then it is unexceptionable. An approaching vessel (which is not dead ahead or astern) will be on a crossing course. If her bearing does not appreciably change (over time), as rule 7(d)(i) makes clear, she will necessarily be on a steadily crossing course, involving a risk of collision. At p 248 Lord Wright said this:</a></p><a name="para93"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Articles 19 and 21 presuppose as their essential conditions that the vessels must be crossing vessels and crossing so as to involve a risk of collision. It is only when these conditions are present that the articles apply, ... But the problem does not depend merely on physical circumstances. As the purpose or articles 19 and 21 is to impose a duty on the give-way ship to keep clear, that ship must be in a position to appreciate what the situation is and to know what the other ship is doing, and whether it is on a course at all or, if so, on what course.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">He then explained that the Rambler could not tell whether the Norefjord was heading for the exit (in which case she was not crossing at all) or for the east side of the basin (in which case she might be). If the quoted passage is read in full together with the explanation which follows, Lord Wright’s reference to the question whether the other ship is “on a course at all or, if so, on what course” means a crossing course not, as a separate condition, a steady course.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The ordinary idea of a course is a sufficiently constant direction of a ship on the same line or heading. This will enable a navigator when he sees the other vessel to know if she is on a crossing course. He can often only become aware of that if he can keep the other vessel under observation for sufficient time to ascertain if she is or is not changing her heading. In the open sea this is the usual procedure.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">But he then illustrated this “usual procedure” by reference to <i>The Otranto</i>, which as already noted was a classic case where the crossing rules were engaged by the taking of a series of bearings, revealing that the two vessels were on a steady bearing, and therefore on a crossing course with a risk of collision. Lord Wright’s description of <i>The Otranto</i> at p 250<i> </i>made repeated reference to bearing rather than heading or<i> </i>course. He may have been using bearing, heading and course as if they were, for the purposes of what he was describing, interchangeable.</p>

Rather we think that Lord Wright meant that a steady bearing observation was enough to show that the two vessels were on a crossing course so as to involve a risk of collision. If it were otherwise it would mean that even though two vessels were on an ascertainable crossing course involving a risk of collision, as shown by a steady bearing observation, the paradigm case for the application of the crossing rules, those rules would not apply because the approaching vessel’s actual course happened not to be “steady”, a consideration of no independent relevance to the risk of collision.</a></p><a name="para95">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If, however, it had been possible to watch her movement for some time, the manoeuvre would not have shown that she was keeping a steady course: her heading would have been altering to port. A curved or curving course, constantly changing under a port helm would not have enabled the give-way vessel to decide how to act for her. Accordingly, of the two conditions that she should be on a course and that the give-way vessel should be able to ascertain that, neither was fulfilled. It may be that in crowded or congested areas, it may not always be possible to ascertain whether the necessary conditions exist. In such cases articles 19 and 21 cannot apply. But wherever possible articles 19 and 21 ought to be applied and strictly enforced because they tend to secure safe navigation.”</p>

He described the first of his two conditions as being that the two vessels be “on a course”, by which he meant a crossing course. The second condition was that the crossing course be ascertainable by the give way vessel. In other words what must be ascertainable is that the other vessel is on a course and that that course is a crossing course. These are the necessary conditions which must exist. He made these remarks about the constantly curving course of the Norefjord, as hypothetically observable from the Rambler. It had never been established in that case that the two vessels were in fact on a steady bearing at all, even if their bearings from each other could have been observed over time.</a></p><a name="para97">

That is what happened in <i>The</i> <i>Alcoa Rambler</i>. Since the working of the crossing rules depends upon how the conduct of each vessel is reasonably observable by the other, they are not engaged in such circumstances. Conversely, even if bearing observations are impossible, the fact that the stand-on vessel is on a steady course may tend to show that the crossing rules are engaged and, if they are, such a course will enable the give-way vessel more easily to keep clear: see eg <i>The Dona Myrto</i> [1959] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 203, 212 per Karminski J.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99">99.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the Court of Appeal and the respondent placed reliance on two more recent cases, <i>The Savina</i> [1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 123 and <i>The Avance</i> [1979] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 143. In <i>The Savina</i>, the leading speech in the House of Lords was given by Lord Simon. The collision involved two large tankers, the Savina and the Forest Hill. From C-11 the Forest Hill was on a heading 340 degrees (true) altering to 350 degrees at C-8 and maintaining that course until collision. The Savina had been aligned on a stationary heading of 080 degrees by a tug by C-15, and thereafter moved her engines to slow ahead, staying on that course until collision, although she went full astern at C-6. The Forest Hill was the putative stand-on vessel. Brandon J had held that a crossing situation applied from C-8 but not before, both because the Forest Hill was not on a definite course before then and because it was only from then that the ships’ crossing courses gave rise to a risk of collision: see per Lord Simon at p 129 (lhc). The Court of Appeal agreed. That finding does not appear to have been directly challenged in the House of Lords. Rather it was argued that if it was apparent to the putative give-way vessel (the Savina) that a potential crossing situation (with a risk of collision) might develop in the future, then it was incumbent on her to take early action to not to let that situation arise, even before the crossing rules were strictly engaged: see p 132 (lhc).</a></p><a name="para99">

He said:</a></p><a name="para100"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That case establishes, in my judgment, that, for the duties under the crossing rules to apply, so as to impose on a vessel the duty to give way, both vessels must be keeping a steady course involving risk of collision and the give-way vessel should be able to ascertain that the other vessel is on such a course.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para100"></a><a name="para101">101.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would readily agree that there is no duty imposed by the crossing rules at a time before they are first engaged by the existence of a crossing situation: ie a crossing giving rise to a risk of collision. As Lord Simon said, until then the two vessels must observe the rules of good seamanship. We would also readily agree that both vessels must be on a crossing course, and, where rule 7(d)(i) applies, by definition this must be a steadily crossing course since it depends on the bearing not appreciably changing (over time). It may well be that this is what Lord Simon meant by “a steady course involving a risk of collision”. If, however, he is suggesting that the crossing rules can never apply until both vessels are on a steady course, we would respectfully disagree and, for reasons already given, it is not supported by <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i>, as properly interpreted. Nor was such a conclusion about its extent necessary to Lord Simon’s rejection of the argument with which he was dealing. None of the cases leading up to <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> (and relied upon by Lord Wright) was cited, and the time when the crossing rules were engaged in <i>The Savina</i> was not in dispute before the House of Lords. We have explained above why, in our opinion, <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> establishes no such general proposition and why, apart from authority, it would not be a correct interpretation of the Rules. <i>The</i> <i>Alcoa Rambler</i> says nothing about the requirements of the course of the putative give-way vessel, and even its dicta about the course of the putative stand-on vessel were heavily conditioned by the facts of the case, and in particular the limitations on visual observation and bearings caused by the crowded anchorage. <i>The Savina</i> was not a case in which it was found that the two vessels were in fact on a crossing course, or a steady bearing, or that there was a risk of collision, before C-8.</a></p><a name="para101">

The Avance was leaving Dakar harbour at night. The Bambara was waiting outside, to avail herself, going in, of the services of the Avance’s pilot. The Avance had the Bambara on her port side. They collided just outside the harbour while the pilot was transferring between the two vessels. The main issue in the case was purely factual: whether the collision had been caused by the Avance turning unexpectedly to port, as alleged by the Bambara, or by the Bambara unexpectedly starting at a late stage to move across her bow, as alleged by the Avance. Brandon J resolved that issue in favour of the Avance so that, on any view as to the law, the Bambara was primarily to blame. But the Bambara also alleged fault by the Avance. One count was that, as the stand-on vessel under the crossing rules, the Avance should have sounded a warning signal. This depended upon whether she was obliged to hold her course. Brandon J said that the crossing rules did not apply because the Bambara was not on a settled course at the time, nor was it possible for those on board the Avance to appreciate that she was, and he referred without further elucidation to <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> as sufficient authority. It is, we think, the only prior English case in which the crossing rules have been excluded because the give-way vessel was not on a settled course. None of the other relevant authorities was referred to by the judge or, probably, drawn to his attention, and there is no analysis of the question why a case about the course of the putative stand-on vessel (<i>The Alcoa Rambler</i>) should be decisive or even relevant to the course of the putative give-way vessel. Nor is it clear that, before her late and unexpected move forward, the Bambara was moving at all, nor whether, if she was, she could reasonably have been perceived to have been on a steady bearing.</a></p><a name="para102">

In the former case, the two vessels had been for some time on reciprocal (not crossing) courses which, had they continued, would have left them passing each other safely, starboard to starboard. But at a very late stage before the collision the Contship Success began a turn to starboard, in a series of 10 degree steps, across the course of the approaching Selat Arjuna, eventually ramming and sinking her. The Contship Success claimed that as a result of her unexpected turn she then became the stand-on vessel under the crossing rules, so that the Selat Arjuna should have kept clear of her. Applying <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i> the deputy judge held that those 10 degree turns had not been sufficiently clear and unequivocal to bring the Contship Success onto a new and (for the first time) crossing course, sufficient for the crossing rules to apply.</a></p><a name="para103">

It was a conventional application of the principle that the Rules need to be applied by reference to what reasonably appears to those navigating one vessel to be being done on the other vessel. The very late alteration of course by the Contship Success did not permit any evaluation of the risk of collision by taking compass bearings. It adds nothing to the analysis of a case (such as the present) when two vessels were crossing each other’s courses, on a steady bearing giving rise to a risk of collision, for 23 minutes before the collision.</a></p><a name="para104">

The Alonso was to starboard of the Sestriere and well ahead of her. She then turned to port across the course of the Sestriere and slowed down to drop her pilot. The Sestriere carried on regardless and, after both vessels made inadequate last-minute efforts to avoid each other, they collided at very slow speed. Brandon J decided that the crossing rules did not apply because the Alonso had not settled on a crossing course. She could have turned in any direction while, or after, dropping her pilot. But he concluded that the question whether the crossing rules applied did not matter, because the Sestriere should in any event have kept clear of her. He referred to <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i>, as authority for the requirement that the putative stand-on vessel needed to be on a “sufficiently defined course” apparent to the other vessel. He made no reference to other authorities or to the analogous cases of <i>The Ada and the Sappho</i> and <i>The Albano</i>, which are both inimical to the notion that<i> </i>a vessel dropping or picking up a pilot is not on a sufficiently defined course to trigger the crossing rules. In <i>The Albano</i> the vessel picking up her pilot was the putative give-way vessel, whereas in <i>The Sestriere</i> she was the putative stand-on vessel. However that may be, we doubt whether Brandon J was right to say that the crossing rules did not apply. But the case adds nothing by way of analysis to what was decided by <i>The Alcoa Rambler</i>.</a></p><a name="para105">

This cited and purported to apply dicta of Judge Learned Hand in <i>Commonwealth and Dominion Line v United States</i> 20 F 2d 729 (1927) - (CA Second Circuit). He said, at p 731:</a></p><a name="para106"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A ship is on a steady course, not only when her heading does not change, but whenever her future positions are certainly ascertainable from her present position and movements. A steady course may thus involve many changes of heading; it is enough if these can with accuracy be foretold. If they can, so that at any given time in the future her position can be ascertained, she is on a course, and if that course crosses the course of another vessel, who holds her on her starboard hand, the latter must keep out of her way.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">In neither of those cases was it established that the vessels which eventually collided had been on steady bearings from each other. In our view Judge Hand’s dictum is not authority for a steady course requirement before the crossing rules can be triggered by the risk of collision which arises from two vessels crossing on a steady bearing. It is broadly in line with the dictum of Sir J W Colvile in <i>The Ada and the Sappho</i>, quoted above.</p>

Gross LJ said, at para 92, that:</a></p><a name="para107"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The mere fact that there was a risk of collision through convergence is not determinative of whether the crossing rules apply. Put colloquially (in Ms Selvaratnam’s words), it takes two to cross.”</p>

Of course it takes two to cross, because the concept of crossing implies that there must be two vessels involved. It may mean that they must both be moving over the ground although, if it does, it leaves a curious lacuna in the Steering Rules, since there is no rule which requires a moving vessel to keep clear of another vessel under way, just because she has no way on. But it will be a very rare case when the bearing of a stationary vessel from a moving vessel does not change, unless the stationary vessel is dead ahead. Be that as it may, if two moving vessels are (as the Court of Appeal put it) “converging with a risk of collision”, then they must either be head-on, overtaking or crossing. If they are, as here, each on a bearing from the other which does not appreciably change (over time), and there is nothing about the circumstances to prevent each from taking visual compass bearings of the other (or from observing the bearing of the other on radar), then providing that they are getting closer to each other they are in fact, and in any event are deemed to be, at risk of collision: see rule 7(d)(i). If the vessels are converging head-on, then rule 14 applies. It they are not head-on but crossing, then the crossing rules apply unless one is overtaking the other: see rule 13. This is of course subject to any special rule, like rule 18, which affords some other “keep clear” priority, and is or may be affected by the narrow channel rules, the subject of the first question before the court.</a></p><a name="para108">

In the present case the judge used the latter in his conclusion in para 71, and “sufficiently constant heading” in para 70. They beg the question: sufficient for what purpose? That is a question of law. In our view the course need only be sufficient to show to the other vessel that they are crossing so as to involve a risk of collision. Where the general direction (ie course) of a vessel is such as to place her on a steady bearing with another vessel, then her course is sufficiently constant or defined for that purpose, unless she is plainly embarked on a course (such as turning around a bend in a river) which will eventually avoid that result: see eg <i>The Pekin</i>. The judge described ALEXANDRA 1 as making “progress in a broadly east south easterly direction”, sufficient to place her on a steady bearing with EVER SMART for over 20 minutes before the collision. That must, by definition, have been a sufficiently constant or defined course for the purpose of engagement of the crossing rules, provided (as has not been challenged) that this was readily to be observed from each vessel, keeping a seamanlike look-out.</a></p><a name="para109">

There are a number of objections to that argument. First, the mere possibility that ALEXANDRA 1 might make a late turn to starboard was insufficient to displace the risk of collision arising from the existence of a steady bearing between the two vessels for the whole of the 23 minutes before the collision. A risk of collision is not displaced by a possibility that the collision may not happen. Secondly, where two vessels are approaching each other on a steady bearing, the risk is deemed to exist: rule 7(d)(i). Thirdly, rule 7(a) provides that if there is any doubt as to the risk of collision, then it shall be deemed to exist. Fourthly, if there is no answer to the existence in this case of a risk of collision, it makes no sense to disapply the crossing rules on a theory that the two vessels were not crossing. The risk of collision was precisely because the two vessels were crossing, as was demonstrated by their readily observable steady bearing from each other over a considerable time, which was plainly not head-on. Finally, a late turn to starboard by ALEXANDRA 1 would not have taken her clear of EVER SMART, because the latter was, to use a time-honoured phrase, hogging the centre of the channel, and showing no sign of moving over to her starboard side.</a></p><a name="para110">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110"></a><a name="para111">111.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would therefore answer Question 2 by holding that, if two vessels, both moving over the ground, are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the engagement of the crossing rules is not dependent upon the give-way vessel being on a steady course. If it is reasonably apparent to those navigating the two vessels that they are approaching each other on a steady bearing (over time) which is other than head-on, then they are indeed both crossing, and crossing so as to involve a risk of collision, even if the give-way vessel is on an erratic course. In such a case, unless the overtaking rule applies, the crossing rules will apply.</a></p><a name="para111">

It does not follow that she should already have been on a steady course, or speed, before the crossing rules could become engaged. Nor does the word “keep” as part of her obligation imply that the stand-on vessel must be assumed already to have been on a steady course. Rule 17, which imposes the “keep course and speed” obligation applies not merely where the crossing rules apply. It applies to every situation where one vessel is identified as the stand-on vessel in relation to another. Thus it applies to a sailing vessel, from which a power driven vessel must always keep clear except when being overtaken, under rule 18(a)(iv). It applies between two sailing vessels under rule 12, and to the vessel being overtaken, under rule 13. But in none of those situations does the engagement of the relevant rule depend upon the stand-on vessel already having been on a steady course. In all those cases “keep” means maintain the course she happened to be on when the relevant Rule became engaged. There is no reason why “keep” should mean something different when rule 17 is triggered by rule 15. And the obligation, once rule 17 is engaged, is to keep both course and speed. But there is no requirement for steady speed before rule 15 (which triggers rule 17) is engaged.</a></p><a name="para112">

Nonetheless a conclusion to the contrary seemed to us (provisionally at least) logically to follow from the main thrust of the appellant’s case.

This is because those navigating the putative give-way vessel need to know, when they see that another vessel is approaching on a steady bearing on their vessel’s starboard side, whether a further and potentially difficult analysis needs to be made as to whether she is also on a steady course, before a decision to alter course and or speed so as to keep well clear can properly be made. In their advice to this court, the Nautical Assessors were firmly of the view that, from a seamanship perspective, no such additional requirement should be imposed. They said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is our opinion there is no requirement for either vessel, to be on a ‘steady course’ to engage the crossing rules - it is enough for a risk of collision to exist.”</p>

That they might impose conflicting requirements in such circumstances is illustrated by the example of a curving channel.

A case which illustrates the application of the crossing rules notwithstanding that vessels were proceeding along a narrow channel is <i>The Leverington</i>. In that case the Leverington was proceeding up the main channel from Cardiff docks and the Rapid was proceeding down the intersecting channel from the Roath Basin. Both were narrow channels and both vessels were proceeding on the starboard side of their respective channels. Rather than keeping her course and speed the Rapid went to starboard (“ported”) in order to cross the bows of the Leverington to get to the starboard side of the main channel and there was a collision. It was held that, although the narrow channel rules applied, the crossing rules also applied. The Rapid, as the stand-on vessel, should accordingly have kept her course and speed.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“LORD HERSCHELL, LC It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the Rapid was in a narrow channel, and that according to article 21 [the narrow channel rule] it was her duty to keep on the starboard side of the channel. This is no doubt a narrow channel, and one to which that article applies. But then it must be remembered that the <i>Leverington</i> had also to keep on her starboard side of the channel, and was in fact on that side. Now the <i>Rapid</i> undoubtedly ported before the collision, and we are advised that, but for this porting, the <i>Rapid</i> and the <i>Leverington</i> might both have continued on their courses with safety … We are further of opinion that article 16 [the crossing rule] is applicable to the present case. Though these are narrow channels, still the general rules of navigation apply, so far as practicable in such places, no other special rules being provided, as is the case in some rivers. That being so, and these vessels being crossing ships, it was the duty of the <i>Leverington</i>, which had the Rapid on her starboard side, to keep out of the way of the latter. The manoeuvre which she executed of keeping her course and going on faster was a compliance with that rule, and no collision would have occurred had the <i>Rapid</i> obeyed article 22 and kept her course. Therefore the <i>Rapid</i> was alone to blame for the collision …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">LORD ESHER, MR These two ships were in a narrow channel, so that article 21 was applicable. The question arises whether article 16 was not also applicable at a particular point in these transactions. That rule must clearly apply in a narrow channel if there are no special rules applicable to it. Instances might easily be given where a smaller river joins a larger, as the Medway joins the Thames, where vessels would be constantly crossing, and where the crossing rule would apply. It is well that we should clearly lay this down, so that in the future when vessels are at the point which was the place of the present collision, and at similar places, there may be no doubt as to their respective duties. Here the <i>Leverington</i> was bound to keep out of the way of the <i>Rapid</i>, and the <i>Rapid</i> to keep her course; the latter ported and broke article 22, while the Leverington was doing what was right in order to keep out of the way of the other ship. Therefore the Rapid is alone to blame for the collision.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">FRY, LJ I am of the same opinion. I think that article 16 applies in narrow channels, and that it would be unwise and incorrect to hold that it does not apply in such places.”</p>

If the crossing rules apply where one narrow channel intersects with another, where both vessels are subject to the narrow channel rules, they must surely also apply where a vessel simply crosses a narrow channel, where only one vessel is subject to the narrow channel rules, as Willmer J stated in <i>The Empire Brent</i>. This is supported by <i>Cockcroft and Lameijer - A Guide to the Collision Avoidance Rules</i>, 7th ed (2012), where it is stated as follows at p 75:</a></p><a name="para122"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<i>Crossing in narrow channels and traffic lanes</i></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Power-driven vessels in a crossing situation in a narrow channel or traffic lane must normally comply with rule 15 but all vessels are required to avoid crossing a narrow channel if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within the channel (rule 9(d)) and a power-driven vessel of less than 20 metres in length must not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane (rule 10(j)).</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Although vessels proceeding in opposite directions in a bending narrow channel may come into a crossing situation rules 15 and 17 do not apply.

In that case the King Stephen was coming in from the North Sea fishing grounds to Grimsby. The Ashton was outbound from Grimsby and<i> </i>there was a collision at the entrance to the river Humber. Gorell Barnes J held that the waterway at the entrance of the Humber was a narrow channel, that the narrow channel rules applied and that the King Stephen was in breach of what is now rule 9(a) in not keeping to the starboard side of the channel. He further held that the crossing rules also applied and that both vessels had been in breach of them. The King Stephen was in breach of the crossing rules in failing to keep her course and speed; the Ashton was in breach in failing to keep out of the way and instead seeking to cross ahead of the King Stephen. This was therefore a case where the crossing rules applied to a collision at the entrance to a narrow channel where one vessel was proceeding along the course of the channel and the other vessel was crossing the entrance of the channel in order to proceed down it.</p>

That is the case where two vessels are proceeding in opposite directions along the course of a narrow channel. It may also be the case where one vessel is proceeding along a narrow channel towards its exit and another vessel is approaching the entry of the channel with a view to proceeding along it.

They are (in date order) <i>The Canberra Star</i> and <i>Kulemesin</i>. But we would prefer to begin the analysis with <i>The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse</i>. That concerned a collision just outside the Western entrance to Cherbourg Harbour, between the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse (“the Kaiser”), then one of the largest passenger steamers in the world, coming out, and the Orinoco, a smaller passenger ship, going in. Each side pleaded breaches of the crossing rules against the other, and the Orinoco also pleaded a breach by the Kaiser of the narrow channel rules, not suggesting that the two could not be applied, and complied with, at the same time. Cherbourg Harbour is defined by a large, roughly semi-circular breakwater, with two entrances in it. The Western entrance is half a mile wide, with ample room for two vessels to pass port to port, each keeping to her starboard side of the entrance. During most of the relevant time before the collision the Orinoco was carefully aligning herself to enter on her starboard side. She was doing 12 knots until three minutes before the collision, slowing to half speed ahead to pass between the breakwaters close to her starboard side, having embarked her French pilot at Southampton. It is clear that she was not waiting to go in. One of the complaints pleaded against her was that she should have done just that, until the Kaiser was out and clear, but this was rejected.</a></p><a name="para126">

She went through the entrance on a diagonal course from the starboard to the port side. She went too fast, increasing from 18 to 22 knots, and she did so in an attempt to cross the bows of the Orinoco, turning to port at a late stage. Her only complaint against the Orinoco which was pursued in the Court of Appeal was that she should have held her course, or stopped sooner.</a></p><a name="para127">

But it is also a case in which responsibility for a collision just outside a narrow channel was decided on the basis that the narrow channel rules rather than the crossing rules were applicable: see per Lord Alverstone CJ at p 263. There is ample reasoning why the entrance was a narrow channel, but little to explain why the crossing rules were thereby disapplied. But it is clear that the Kaiser was leaving, and the Orinoco shaping her course to come in, on her final approach, rather than waiting, either for a pilot, or for the Kaiser to come out.</a></p><a name="para128">

At the point of collision the channel has, looking down river, a right hand bend in it. The Canberra Star was coming up river but, as she approached the bend, she was cutting the corner and thereby straying onto her port side of the channel. The City of Lyons had started in an anchorage on her starboard side of the channel, and was moving into the channel to proceed down river on her starboard side, her engines full ahead, and having already worked up to 5 knots. She saw the red light of the Canberra Star on a steady bearing on her starboard side, cutting the corner. Having failed to alert the Canberra Star, she then turned hard to port, across the bows of the Canberra Star, which struck her despite going full astern at the very last moment. Unsurprisingly Hewson J held that both vessels were to blame, the Canberra Star for proceeding on the wrong side of the channel and the City of Lyons for turning to port rather than to starboard to avoid the impending collision.</a></p><a name="para129">

Rather the narrow channel rules applied. The City of Lyons was in fact already adjusting her course so as to be on her starboard side when she reached the narrow channel at the Cliffe Lower Buoy, and increasing her speed. She was in no sense waiting to enter it, nor did the Canberra Star think that she was. On the contrary, it was the major (but unsuccessful) plank in the case of the Canberra Star that the City of Lyons should have done just that, until the Canberra Star was past and clear.</a></p><a name="para130"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para130"></a><a name="para131">131.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hewson J said at p 28:</a></p><a name="para131"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the circumstances of this case, where vessel <i>A</i>, proceeding down river outside the channel, intending to enter it, sees an up-coming vessel <i>B</i> approaching in the next reach, bearing on her starboard side, on a main-channel course which, if followed into the reach in which <i>A</i> is navigating, will or should enable the two vessels to pass safely port to port by reason of the fact that <i>B</i> should keep to her own starboard side of the channel and <i>A</i> will navigate into and keep to her own starboard side, the crossing rule does not, in my view, apply.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">This was, evidently, a statement addressed to the particular facts of that case, rather than one which sought to express any general principle about the relationship between the crossing rules and the narrow channel rules. The facts included these: the City of Lyons was not waiting, but shaping to enter the channel, and the collision was only going to occur, if at all, within the channel, as indeed it did. The Canberra Star was not leaving the channel like EVER SMART. She was proceeding along it, nowhere near its end.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para131"></a><a name="para132">132.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collision in <i>Kulemesin</i> occurred just inside the end of a narrow channel in the vicinity of Hong Kong, between the Yao Hai, which had just entered the channel from seaward, and the Neftegaz 67 (“the N67”) which was leaving it, but hogging the centre of the channel rather than keeping on her starboard side. The N67 took no action to avoid the oncoming Yao Hai, which was shaping her course so as to enter the channel on her starboard side, until a disastrous turn to port by the N67 at the last moment led to a collision in which more than half her crew lost their lives.</a></p><a name="para132"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para132"></a><a name="para133">133.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main navigational issue in the case was whether the channel was a narrow channel at all. If it was, it was not alleged that the crossing rules applied: see per Lord Clarke at p 258, at para 201. But at para 217 Lord Clarke cited the above extract from the judgment of Hewson J in <i>The Canberra Star</i>, saying, at para 218: “That seems good sense to me”. Later, at para 225, he continued:</a></p><a name="para133"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para133">“</a><a name="_Hlk53480399">I have already concluded that the CP channel is a narrow channel. I have also expressed the view in para 217 that vessels approaching a narrow channel and intending to proceed along it are not bound by the crossing rule but must enter the channel and, as they do so, keep as near to the starboard side as is safe and practicable in accordance with rule 9. It seems to me to follow that a vessel shaping to enter the channel should, as a matter of good seamanship, navigate in such a manner that, when she reaches the channel, she is on the starboard side of the channel in accordance with r</a>ule 9.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Clarke used both the descriptions “approaching a narrow channel and intending to proceed along it” and “shaping to enter the narrow channel” in the same apparent statement of principle. It is material to see which of those potentially different descriptions better described the navigation of the Yao Hai. Plainly the latter did. She was proceeding at 13.5 knots. It is clear that she was shaping to enter, on her final approach, rather than merely approaching with intent to proceed along it, although she was of course literally doing that as well. On any view she was not waiting to enter.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134">134.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The area just outside the entrance of a narrow channel, where it meets the open sea, is a place where vessels may be engaged in a variety of different activities. It is convenient to identify three broad groups. Group 1 are vessels which are approaching the entrance of the channel, heading across it, on a route between start and finishing points unconnected with the narrow channel. They are approaching the entrance of the channel, but not intending or preparing to enter it at all. Group 2 are vessels which are intending to enter, and on their final approach to the entrance, adjusting their course to arrive at their starboard side of it. Examples include the Orinoco, the City of Lyons (although not at the entrance) and the Yao Hai. Group 3 are approaching vessels which are also intending and preparing to enter, but are waiting to enter rather than entering: ALEXANDRA 1 is a prime example, but the group also includes the Bambara in <i>The Avance</i>. They may be stationary, or moving, although still waiting to enter.</a></p><a name="para134"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134"></a><a name="para135">135.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was common ground between counsel, and correctly so, that the crossing rules apply as between a vessel leaving the channel, approaching its entrance, and a vessel in Group 1, regardless which of them had the other on her starboard side. This is because the approaching vessel in Group 1 is not preparing or intending to enter it (the respondent’s formulation), or shaping to enter it (the appellant’s formulation). It is also common ground, and rightly so, that the narrow channel rules, and not the crossing rules, apply as between the leaving vessel and a vessel in Group 2. That is because the approaching vessel is both preparing and intending to enter it, and already shaping (ie adjusting her course and speed to do so), on her final approach.</a></p><a name="para135"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para135"></a><a name="para136">136.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The debate in the present case concerns Group 3. The respondent submits that the “preparing and intending to enter” test, which they seek to derive from <i>The Canberra Star</i> and <i>Kulemesin</i>, applies to a vessel<i> </i>waiting to enter, in particular if she is, like ALEXANDRA 1, waiting in a designated pilot boarding area, so that the crossing rules are overridden by the narrow channel rules. The appellant submits that no necessity arises for the crossing rules to be overridden until the approaching vessel is actually shaping to enter, adjusting her course and speed to arrive at the entrance on her starboard side of it, on her final approach, in accordance with rule 9(a). That is what the approaching vessels were all doing, in <i>The</i> <i>Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse</i>, <i>The Canberra Star</i> and <i>Kulemesin</i>.</a></p><a name="para136"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para136"></a><a name="para137">137.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant, for the following reasons. First, the principle enunciated by Lord Wright in <i>The</i> <i>Alcoa Rambler</i> and by Atkin LJ in<i> The Ulrikka</i> that the crossing rules should be applied wherever they can, as between vessels which are in fact crossing so as to involve a risk of collision, means that they should not be overridden in the absence of an express stipulation, unless there is a compelling necessity to do so. There is or may be such a compelling necessity in Group 2 cases, as the facts of the above three cases demonstrate, but not in Group 3 cases.</a></p><a name="para137"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para137"></a><a name="para138">138.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a Group 2 case, the necessity to disapply the crossing rules arises because, once she is shaping and adjusting her course to enter the narrow channel, the approaching vessel is already having her navigation determined by the need to be in compliance with rule 9(a) when she reaches the entrance, that is, to arrive at her starboard side of it, on a course which enables her to continue on her starboard side of the channel. By contrast, no such necessity affects the Group 3 waiting vessel, or any vessel approaching the channel intending to enter it, which has yet to shape her course to enter it on her starboard side of it. If she is the give-way vessel under the crossing rules, she can alter course or slow down so as to keep clear of the stand-on vessel as she emerges from the channel. In the present case ALEXANDRA 1 was the give-way vessel. She could have kept clear of EVER SMART by stopping, or by turning to starboard, even if that would have taken her outside and to the West of the green No 1 buoy, where the charted depth was no shallower than in the pilot waiting area, provided she continued to turn to starboard. If she is the stand-on vessel under the crossing rules, then she can simply maintain her course and speed.</a></p><a name="para138"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para138"></a><a name="para139">139.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a Group 3 case, no similar necessity affects the vessel leaving the narrow channel. If she is the stand-on vessel, she can maintain her course, taking avoiding action under rule 17(a)(ii) or (b) only when it becomes apparent to her that the other vessel is not intending to give way, or when action by both vessels is required to avoid a collision. Then she can slow down or stop. She may be constrained by her draught not to turn to starboard but, if not, she can turn out of the channel to starboard. Rules 17(c) and 9(a) will generally prevent her from turning to port.</a></p><a name="para139"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para139"></a><a name="para140">140.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was submitted for the respondent that, even in a Group 3 case, the putative stand-on vessel leaving the channel would be in a dilemma if proceeding in the centre or on the port side of the channel because the crossing rules would require her to maintain her course, whereas the narrow channel rules would require her to turn to starboard. But this is a false dilemma, for three reasons. First, as already explained, the obligation on the stand-on vessel does not mean that she must literally maintain her precise course. Keeping her course and speed includes doing so in compliance with any other applicable rule. Secondly, a question of construction about the relationship between two rules should be approached on the basis that they are being complied with, rather than (as here by EVER SMART) flouted. Thirdly the same false dilemma would arise in a Group 1 case (where the vessel crossing the end of the channel was the give way-vessel) even though it is common ground that the crossing rules apply.</a></p><a name="para140"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para140"></a><a name="para141">141.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second reason for preferring the appellant’s case is that the test for the occasion when, of necessity, the crossing rules should be overridden must be a clear one, clear that is to those navigating both the vessels involved. Fundamental to the construction of the Rules is the need to apply them by reference to what is reasonably apparent to those navigating each vessel about the conduct of the other. On that basis of assessment, the test propounded by the appellant is the clear winner. The crossing rules are overridden only when the approaching vessel is shaping to enter the channel, adjusting her course so as to reach the entrance on the starboard side of it, on her final approach. That can be determined from the vessel leaving the channel by visual (or radar) observation of the approaching vessel’s course and speed. But the respondent’s test is only that the approaching vessel is intending and preparing to enter the narrow channel. Of course, the fact that she is approaching the entrance of the channel may readily be observed, but that is true also of vessels in Group 1, where the crossing rules apply. How is the leaving vessel to know what the approaching vessel is intending, or what preparations she may be making? Picking up a pilot before entering a river or a harbour entrance is clearly not a sufficient act of preparation to displace the crossing rules: see <i>The Ada and the Sappho</i> and <i>The Albano</i>. Merely being in a pilot boarding area cannot of itself be decisive, since vessels may be proceeding in that area for other reasons, eg because they are leaving the narrow channel, or merely passing its entrance en route to a completely different destination, as was the tug ZAKHEER BRAVO in the present case.</a></p><a name="para141"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, application of the appellant’s test will override the crossing rules in fewer cases than the respondent’s test, thereby adhering to the principle that the crossing rules should (where engaged) be strictly applied if they can be. In all three groups identified above, the crossing rules will only be engaged if the two vessels are in fact (and visibly to those navigating each) crossing so as to involve a risk of collision. A test which then overrides them in narrower circumstances than another competing test is, we think, clearly to be preferred.</a></p><a name="para142"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para142"></a><a name="para143">143.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we should address the Court of Appeal’s reliance on the advice of the Elder Brethren in relation to the East-West scenario of an incoming vessel crossing to the starboard side of the channel to prepare for entry as somehow endorsing the conclusion it had reached that the crossing rules do not apply. This was a matter for the court rather than the Elder Brethren. As stated in <i>Marsden and Gault</i> at para 7-85, the “function of nautical assessors is to advise the court as to matters of navigation and seamanship”. The proper construction of the Collision Regulations is a matter of law for the court to determine. The Elder Brethren were asked to state what actions they would “expect from a prudent mariner in accordance with the ordinary practice of seamen” in the context of the hypothetical East-West scenario. This involved giving advice as regards good seamanship, and required no assumption to be made as to what may or may not have been required under the crossing rules. Their advice was to the effect it should have been possible to avoid the risk of collision through prudent seamanship by the inbound and outbound vessels. That does not mean, however, that that risk could not have been avoided by the application of the crossing rules. Their advice, moreover, included that the outbound vessel should have been prepared “to adjust own ship’s speed to resolve close quarter/collision risk if necessary within the constraints of remaining in the channel and on the starboard side”. These are essentially the actions required of the outbound vessel as the give-way vessel under the crossing rules (which EVER SMART would have been in the East-West scenario). We do not therefore consider that their advice supports either the Court of Appeal’s conclusion or the respondent’s case on the appeal.</a></p><a name="para143"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para143"></a><a name="para144">144.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view the East-West scenario demonstrates why the crossing rules need to govern that crossing situation. The vessel approaching from the East will have to cross the line of the channel before she can turn to port to shape a course to get to her starboard side of it, taking her across the bows of the vessel leaving the channel. The narrow channel rules therefore do nothing to help either vessel avoid a collision, still less do they explain which vessel should keep clear of the other. If the crossing rules do not apply, then the risk of collision inherent in their approaching each other on a steady bearing is not addressed by any Rule.</a></p><a name="para144"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would therefore answer Question 1 in the negative. Where an outbound vessel in a narrow channel is crossing with an approaching vessel so as to involve a risk of collision, the crossing rules are not overridden by the narrow channel rules merely because the approaching vessel is intending and preparing to enter the narrow channel. The crossing rules are only overridden if and when the approaching vessel is shaping to enter, adjusting her course so as to reach the entrance on her starboard side of it, on her final approach.</a></p><a name="para145">

We would accordingly allow the appeal.</a></p><a name="para146">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147"></a><a name="para148">148.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither of the parties has however asked this court to re-consider the apportionment of blame or liability, if minded to allow the appeal on the two questions of construction. Rather, they would prefer to have all matters of apportionment to be re-determined if necessary by the Admiralty Court. We agree that this would be the best course. Although Teare J has retired from full-time sitting, it would be appropriate for him to undertake that task, if available and willing to do so.</a></p><a name="para148">
