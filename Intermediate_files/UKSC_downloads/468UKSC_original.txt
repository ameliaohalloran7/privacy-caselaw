Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale and Lord Reed agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In April 2012 the Supreme Court considered a case called <i>Summers v
Fairclough Homes Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/26.html">[2012] UKSC 26</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/26.html">[2012] 1 WLR 2004</a>, where the facts
were strikingly similar to those here. In that case, as in this one, the
claimant suffered an injury at work which was caused by the negligence or breach
of duty of his employer. In each case the employer was either held liable (in <i>Summers</i>)
or admitted liability (here) as to 80%, the claimant accepting that he was 20%
to blame. In each case the claimant dishonestly exaggerated the extent of the
consequences of the injury. In <i>Summers </i>the claimant originally claimed
damages of over £800,000 but was awarded a total of just over £88,000 on the
basis of the true facts, which came to light after undercover surveillance
evidence showed that his account of the consequences of his injuries had been
grossly and dishonestly exaggerated. In the instant case, the claimant, Mr
Colin Hayward, claimed £419,316.59 (exclusive of promotion prospects but
discounted for loss of ill health pension). He was ultimately awarded £14,720
after a trial before His Honour Judge Moloney QC (“the judge”). The reason for
the reduction was again partly as a result of undercover surveillance and other
evidence that showed that Mr Hayward’s claim had been grossly and dishonestly
exaggerated.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Summers </i>the issue was what remedies were available to the
employer and its insurers, whereas in the instant case the issue arises out of
a settlement agreement reached between the parties on 3 October 2003, the
accident having occurred on 9 June 1998. The agreement was made shortly before
the issue of quantum was due to be tried and was incorporated in a Tomlin Order.
The employer’s case was conducted on its behalf by its liability insurer,
Zurich Insurance Company Plc (“Zurich”), which is the appellant in this appeal.
The employer (in practice Zurich) agreed to pay £134,973.11, inclusive of CRU
of £22,473.11, in full and final settlement of Mr Hayward’s claim.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Tomlin order was in familiar terms as follows:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“BY CONSENT</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">IT IS ORDERED THAT</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">All further proceedings in this
action be stayed, except for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect.
Liberty to apply as to carrying such terms into effect.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">THE SCHEDULE</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The claimant accepts in settlement
of his cause of action herein the sum of £134,973.11.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon payment by the defendant
of the several sums and costs before mentioned, they be discharged from any
further liability to the claimant in relation to the claim herein.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2005, Mr Hayward’s neighbours, Mr and Mrs Cox, who had lived next
door to him since June 2002, approached the employer to say that they <span style="font-size:12.5pt">believed that his claim to have suffered a serious
back injury was dishonest. From their observation of his conduct and
activities, they believed that he had recovered in full from his injury at
least a year before the settlement. They were referred to Zurich and made full
witness statements to that effect.</span></a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In February 2009 Zurich commenced the present proceedings against Mr<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> </span>Hayward claiming damages for
deceit. Zurich pleaded that both written statements made by Mr Hayward or on
his behalf, and his statements of case in the Particulars of Claim and the
Schedule(s) of Loss as to the extent of his injury, as well as his accounts
given to the medical experts, constituted fraudulent misrepresentations. Damages
were claimed equivalent to the difference between the amount of the settlement
and the damages that should have been awarded if he had told the truth. The
claim was subsequently amended to claim in the alternative rescission of the
settlement agreement and the repayment of the sums paid under it.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>No point has been taken in reliance upon the fact that the action was
brought in the name of Zurich rather than the employer. Mr<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> </span>Hayward applied to strike out
the proceedings, or for summary judgment in his favour. He contended that the
Tomlin Order created an estoppel per rem judicatam and/or by record,
alternatively that the action was an abuse of the process because the issue of
fraud had been compromised by the settlement. Deputy District Judge Bosman
refused to strike out the claim, although he directed Zurich to amend the claim
to seek an order that the compromise be set aside rather than an order for
damages. Although it was pleaded in the original defence to Zurich’s claim that
Zurich must satisfy the test in <i>Ladd v Marshall</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1954/1.html">[1954] 1 WLR 1489</a>, that
contention was not ultimately pursued following the hearing before the DDJ. His
decision was reversed on appeal by Judge Yelton.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Zurich appealed to the Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay, Smith and
Moore-Bick LJJ) and the decision of the Deputy District Judge was unanimously
restored: see </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/641.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 641</a>. It was held that the settlement gave rise to
no estoppel of any kind and that the action was not an abuse of process. It was
further held that the fact that Zurich had alleged deliberate exaggeration
prior to the settlement did not preclude them from relying on it subsequently
as a ground for rescission. In the result, the claim proceeded. I note in
passing that Moore-Bick LJ said at para 58:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If it is to succeed in its action
Zurich will have to persuade the court that it was induced to agree to the
settlement by fraud on the part of Mr Hayward, a task that may not prove easy,
given the fact that it already knew enough to justify the service of a defence
in the terms indicated earlier.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial came before the judge in the Cambridge County Court in
November 2012. He heard evidence for Zurich from Zurich’s solicitor (Ms
Winterbottom) and its claims manager (Mr Birkenshaw), who were responsible for
the conduct of the litigation, from Mr and Mrs Cox and from Mr Sharp, who was
the orthopaedic expert instructed on behalf of Zurich. Mr Hayward gave evidence
together with three members of his family and also called evidence from Mr
Varley, who was the orthopaedic surgeon instructed on his behalf.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Hayward denied any suggestion that his condition was anything other
than genuine or that there was any element of exaggeration. He maintained
throughout that he was a seriously disabled individual whose disability arose
from the original accident and was such that, ever since, he had not been able
to work or carry out normal activities of daily living without assistance. As
with the first series of witness statements, Mr Hayward signed the appropriate
statements of truth setting out in detail the extent of his disability and
presented himself to the medical experts on that basis.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following a four-day trial, the judge found that Mr Hayward had
deliberately and dishonestly exaggerated the effects of his injury throughout
the court process. Of Ms Winterbottom and Mr Birkenshaw, the judge said (at
para 2.6 of his judgment quoted in full below) both that: “[n]either can be
said to have believed the representations complained of to be true” and that “[t]hey
may not themselves have believed the representations to be true; but they did
believe that they would be put before the court as true, and that there was a
real risk that the court would accept them in whole or part and consequently make
a larger award than Zurich would otherwise have considered appropriate”. The
judge further found that, although Zurich was aware at the time of the
settlement of the real possibility of fraud, Mr Hayward had continued his
deliberate misrepresentations even after the disclosure of the 1999 video, and
that those continuing misrepresentations influenced Zurich into agreeing a
higher level of settlement than it would otherwise have done. The judge
therefore set aside the compromise.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>It followed that the issue of quantum in the original action remained to
be tried. That issue was heard on 6 September 2013 and, having found that Mr<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> </span>Hayward had made a full recovery
from any continuing physical disability by October 1999, the judge thereafter
handed down a judgment awarding Mr Hayward damages in the modest sum of
£14,720, which was about 10% of the settlement figure. An order was made in the
later action directing him to repay the sum paid under the settlement less that
amount, namely £97,780, interest of £34,379.45 and £3,951 adjustment for CRU.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>Mr<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> </span>Hayward appealed
to the Court of Appeal against the decision that the settlement should be set
aside but did not appeal against the judge’s assessment of quantum or
(contingent on whether the settlement was set aside) against the order for

Briggs LJJ. Although King LJ agreed with both judgments, I do not read their

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his para 9 Underhill LJ set out para 2.5 of the judge’s judgment,
where he said that the judge addressed the issue of reliance and dealt with the
law. Para 2.5 is in these terms:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Lastly, of course, it is
necessary that the employer/Zurich should <i>rely</i> on the representations
and suffer loss as a result. Here an interesting (and apparently unresolved)
question of principle arises. In the ordinary case, sale of goods for example,
reliance by the purchaser is effectively equivalent to his <i>belief in the
truth</i> of the statement; if he believes the goods are as represented, he
will be relying on the representation (and acting on it by his purchase) and if
not, not. In the litigation context the position is different. In such a
situation, the party to whom the representation is made is by no means likely
to believe it to be true at the pre-trial stage. At the very least, statements
made in the course of litigation will be viewed with healthy scepticism and
weighed against the other material available. Often the other party will not be
sure, even then, whether the statement is in fact true, and will mainly concern
himself with how likely it is to be accepted by the court. Sometimes (a staged
road traffic ‘accident’ for example) the other party may actually be certain
from his own direct knowledge that the statement is a deliberate lie. But even
then he and his advisers cannot choose to ignore it; they must still take into
account the risk that it will be believed by the judge at trial. This situation
is quite different from a proposed purchase, where if in doubt one can simply
walk away. For these reasons, <span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">it </span>appears
to me that the many dicta relied on by CH, to the effect that liability
requires that the representation must be believed by the other party, are not
applicable to a case like the present. The formulation adopted by the editors
of Clerk and Lindsell, 20th ed (2010), at 18-34 fits the case better; ‘The
claimant must have been <i>influenced</i> by the misrepresentation’ (my
emphasis).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After noting that ‘CH’ was shorthand for Mr Hayward, Underhill LJ set
out (also in his para 9), para 2.6 of the judge’s judgment as follows:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I heard the evidence of Ms
Winterbottom and Mr Birkinshaw respectively in 2003 Zurich’s litigation
solicitor and claims handler. Each was aware of the 1999 video and of the real
possibility that this was a fraudulent claim. Each was frustrated by the
reluctance of ‘their’ expert, Mr Sharp, to produce a clear supplemental report
saying that he now believed CH to have been shamming and to have sustained far
less harm than was being claimed. Neither can be said to have believed the
representations complained of to be true. But, if the law is as stated at 2.5
above, this does not matter provided the representations <i>influenced</i> them
in their decision how much to pay CH in settlement. I am in no doubt that they
did. They may not themselves have believed the representations to be true; but
they did believe that they would be put before the court as true, and that
there was a real risk that the court would accept them in whole or part and
consequently make a larger award than Zurich would otherwise have considered
appropriate. Acting in reliance on <i>that</i> belief (which, whether or not CH
was truthful or honest, was the belief he and his advisers must have wanted
them to form on the basis of the statements) they made the payment into court
which led to the Tomlin Order settlement.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Underhill LJ then set out the substance of the judge’s
ultimate conclusions from para 6.6 in these terms:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… although Zurich was aware at
the time of the settlement of the real possibility of fraud here, CH had
continued his deliberate misrepresentations even after the disclosure of the
1999 video, and those continuing misrepresentations did influence Zurich into
agreeing a higher level of settlement than it would otherwise have made.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The judge added: “The conditions required for setting
aside the settlement are therefore made out and I so order.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Para 6.6 must be put in its context, which includes paras 6.4 and 6.5. Between
paras 6.1 and 6.3 the judge explained why he accepted the evidence of Mr and
Mrs Cox as credible. He then said this in paras 6.4 and 6.5:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice before me is
not the stark one between ‘no pain at all’ and ‘complete disability’. What I
have to decide is whether CH’s actual level of pain and disability at<span style="font-size:12.5pt"> </span>the time of the representations was materially
less than he was representing, and if so whether that misrepresentation was
deliberate and dishonest. It is accepted that there was here an injury leading
to a measure of pain and disability, at least up to 2002; and Mr Sharp and Mr
Varley do not exclude some continuing pain (as opposed to disability) in the
period after the settlement. That being so, the records of pain management and
analgesic drug treatment which gave me concern are not irreconcilable with
Zurich’s case.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:72.0pt">6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no special standard of proof for fraud
in civil proceedings; the normal test of balance of probability applies, though
of course in assessing the probabilities one bears in mind that fraud is an
unusual matter. In this case, the evidence, summarised above, that CH was not
in fact suffering from the level of pain and disability that he claimed is so
strong that it prevails over his innocent explanations. The probability is, and
I so find, that CH was experiencing some pain both before and after the settlement,
and did want it treated and managed; but at the same time, he also wanted the
maximum compensation he could obtain, and to get it he was dishonestly willing
to exaggerate his symptoms to the doctors, and to conceal his real level of
ability from them and from the world, so as to give the false impression that
he was not capable of heavy work when in fact he was. He must have been aware
by the time of the 14 October 1999 surveillance video (at the latest) that his
physical abilities were considerably greater than he thereafter represented to
the doctors and his employers’ representatives, and I find that his
representations made after that date were knowingly false and misleading.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Underhill and Briggs LJJ allowed Mr Hayward’s appeal for similar but not
identical reasons. They did so essentially because of the state of mind of
Zurich (and the employer) when the settlement was made. They rejected the
conclusions of principle expressed in para 2.5 of the judge’s judgment set out
above. The parties to this appeal agreed that the appeal raised two issues. The
first was this.</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In order to set aside a
compromise on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation, to show the requisite
influence by or reliance on the misrepresentation:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must the defrauded
representee prove that it was induced into settlement because it believed that
the misrepresentations were true; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does it suffice to
establish influence that the fact of the misrepresentations was a material cause
of the defrauded representee entering into the settlement?”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The second was this.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Under what circumstances, if any,
does the suspicion by the defendant of exaggeration for financial gain on the
part of the claimant preclude unravelling the settlement of that disputed claim
when fraud is subsequently established?”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subject to one point, the ingredients of a claim for deceit based upon
an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation are not in dispute. It must be shown
that the defendant made a materially false representation which was intended
to, and did, induce the representee to act to its detriment. To my mind it is
not necessary, as a matter of law, to prove that the representee believed that
the representation was true. In my opinion there is no clear authority to the
contrary. However, that is not to say that the representee’s state of mind may
not be relevant to the issue of inducement. Indeed, it may be very relevant. For
example, if the representee does not believe that the representation is true,
he may have serious difficulty in establishing that he was induced to enter
into the contract or that he has suffered loss as a result. The judge makes
this point clearly and accurately in the third sentence of para 2.5 of his
admirable judgment.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He makes a further point in the same paragraph which is of importance in
the context of this somewhat unusual case. It is this. A person in the position
of the employer or its insurer may have suspicions as to whether the
representation is true. It may even be strongly of the view that it is not
true. However, the question in a case like this is not what view the employer
or its insurer takes but what view the court may take in due course. This is
just such a case, as the judge correctly perceived. As he put it, the employer
and its advisers must take into account the possibility that Mr Hayward would
be believed by the judge at the trial. That is because the views of the judge
will determine the amount of damages awarded.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event this is not a case in which Zurich or the employer knew
that Mr Hayward was deliberately exaggerating the seriousness and long term
effects of his injuries. We now know that he was thoroughly dishonest from
October 1999 and that he continued to make false claims in the witness box at
the trial even when the evidence against him was overwhelming. Each case of
course depends upon its own facts but it seems to me to be putting the case too
high to say, as Briggs LJ does at para 30, that Zurich went so far as to plead
that Mr Hayward was fraudulent and to support it by a statement of truth. He
says this at para 31:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my opinion the true principle
is that the equitable remedy of rescission answers the affront to conscience
occasioned by holding to a contract a party who has been influenced into making
it by being misled or, worse still, defrauded by his counterparty. Thus, once
he discovers the truth, he must elect whether to rescind or to proceed with the
contract. It must follow that, if he already knows or perceives the truth by
the time of the contract, he elects to proceed by entering into it, and cannot
later seek rescission merely because he later obtains better evidence of that
which he already believed, still less if he merely repents of it. This seems to
me to be <i>a fortiori </i>the case where, as here, the misrepresentation
consists of a disputed claim in litigation, and the contract settles that
claim.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To my mind that is to put the position too high in favour of fraudsters
in general and Mr Hayward in particular. It is true that in its defence dated
30 October 2001 the employer (no doubt through Zurich) stated that the facts
stated in the defence were true. The relevant facts were pleaded in paras 6 and
7 as follows:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is admitted that the
claimant suffered an injury to his back as a result of the accident. The defendant
relies on the medical reports of Mr Sharp dated 11 June 2000, 20 August 2000
and 26 November 2000. The view of the claimant’s ongoing physical condition
from Mr Bracegirdle relied on by the claimant is not accepted by the defendant.
As a result of video surveillance obtained Mr Sharp formed the view that the claimant’s
disability was not as great as he had described and he was capable of working
full time even if not with heavy lifting. In view of the claimant’s lack of
candour in relation to his physical condition it is not possible to accept that
his depressive state, as described, has been consistent, is continuing or will
continue into the future.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The claimant has
exaggerated his difficulties in recovery and current physical condition for
financial gain.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These pleas show that Zurich was suspicious of Mr Hayward but no very
clear allegations were, or could be, made. However, it is not in dispute that
Zurich did as much as it reasonably could to investigate the position before
the settlement. The evidence was not as good from its point of view as it might
have hoped but the fact is that Zurich did not know the extent of Mr Hayward’s
misrepresentations. The case was settled at a time when the only difference
between the experts was the likely duration of future loss. The figure agreed
was about half way between the respective opinions of the experts. It was not
until the advent of Mr and Mrs Cox that Zurich realised the true position.
Hence, as the judge expressly found, the amount of the settlement was very much
greater than it would have been but for the fraudulent misrepresentations made
by Mr Hayward. The small amount ultimately awarded by the judge, which is not
challenged, shows the extent of the dishonest nature of the claim. I am not
persuaded that the importance of encouraging settlement, which I entirely agree
is considerable, is sufficient to allow Mr Hayward to retain moneys which he
only obtained by fraud.</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;page-break-after:avoid"><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The authorities</span></i></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not persuaded that the authorities lead to any other conclusion. As
stated above, the ingredients of the tort of deceit are not in dispute subject
to one question, which is whether a claimant alleging deceit must show that he
believed the misrepresentation. In my opinion the answer is no.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are many formulations of the relevant principles in the
authorities. I take two examples. In <i>Briess v Woolley </i>[1954] AC 333, 353
Lord Tucker said:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The tort of fraudulent
misrepresentation is not complete when the representation is made. It becomes
complete when the misrepresentation - not having been corrected in the meantime
- is acted upon by the representee. Damage giving rise to a claim for damages
may not follow or may not result until a later date, but once the misrepresentation
is acted upon by the representee the tortious act is complete provided that the
representation is false at that date.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">To like effect, Lord Mustill said in <i>Pan Atlantic
Insurance Co Ltd v Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd (No 2)</i> [1995] 1 AC 501, 542A:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the general law it is beyond
doubt that even a fraudulent misrepresentation must be shown to have induced
the contract before the promisor has a right to avoid, although the task of
proof may be made more easy by a presumption of inducement.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The authorities show that questions of inducement and causation are
questions of fact. I would accept the submissions made on behalf of Zurich in
support of the proposition that belief is not required as an independent
ingredient of the tort. It may however be relevant as part of the court’s
consideration of the questions whether there was inducement and, if so, whether
causation has been established.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this regard I agree with the judge when he said at the end of para
2.5 that Clerk and Lindsell’s statement in the previous edition fits the case
better. It simply said “The claimant must have been influenced by the
misrepresentation”. That is a sub-heading to para 18-34 in the 21st ed. In para
18-35 the editors say that, although the claimant must show that he was induced
to act as he did by the misrepresentation, it need not have been the sole
cause. It is submitted on behalf of Mr Hayward that the claimant’s mind must be
at least partly influenced by the defendant’s misstatements. In <i>Edgington v
Fitzmaurice </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1885/83.html">(1885) 29 Ch D 459</a>, 483 Bowen LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The real question is, what was
the state of the plaintiff’s mind, and if his mind was disturbed by the
misstatement of the defendants, and such disturbance was in part the cause of
what he did, the mere fact of his also making a mistake himself could make no
difference.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">I see no conflict between the judge’s approach and those
conclusions.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Hayward relies upon the references in the textbooks and, indeed, in
cases like <i>Edgington v Fitzmaurice </i>to the requirement that the representation
must have impacted upon the representee’s mind. To my mind that simply means
that the representee must have been induced to act as he did in reliance upon
the representation.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Zurich’s written case its argument in support of the position that
belief in the truth of the representation is not required is summarised as
follows:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inducement is concerned
with causation - not the representee’s credulity. Although one may infer that a
representee who believes a misrepresentation has been induced to rely on it, an
absence of belief does not mean there was no inducement. This is because what
is required for there to be inducement is a causal connection between the
misrepresentation and the representee making a decision or undertaking a course
of action on the basis of that representation. That does not require belief in
the misrepresentation itself.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as belief in the
misrepresentation is not required, so also belief in other inducing causes is
irrelevant.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a ‘<i>presumption
of inducement</i>’, particularly where there is an intention to induce by means
of fraud. If the defrauded representee first had to show he <i>believed </i>the
misrepresentation, there would be little (or no) utility in having the
presumption.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That presumption should
not be rebutted merely because the representee is sceptical. Otherwise, the
doubting representee would be placed in a worse position than the gullible or
trusting one. Given that misgivings and suspicion might be more likely to arise
where there is fraud, it would be perverse for the prospects of redress to be
extinguished on account of those very doubts. Of all representees, it may be
thought the defrauded representee (whether believing or not) should be the most
deserving of protection.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no duty upon
the defrauded representee to exercise ‘due diligence’ to determine whether
there are reasonable grounds to believe the representations made. Conversely,
the fact that the representee does not in fact wholly credit the fraudster and
carries out its own investigations does not preclude it from having been
induced by those representations. Qualified belief or disbelief does not rule
out inducement, particularly where those investigations were never going to
find out the evidence that subsequently came to light.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas proof that the representee
had knowledge (or ‘blind eye knowledge’) of the falsity suffices, nothing short
of that avails the misrepresentor.”</p>

</span>As to sub-para (i), inducement, I would accept the submission on behalf
of Zurich that materiality is evidence of inducement because what is material
tends to induce. As Hutley JA put it in the Court of Appeal of New South Wales,
<i>Gipps v Gipps </i>[1978] 1 NSWLR 454, 460, “[t]o state that a person is
induced by a statement is to affirm a causal relation which is a question of
fact, not of law”. See also <i>Downs v Chappell </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1358.html">[1997] 1 WLR 426</a>, per
Hobhouse LJ at 433. Moreover, albeit by reference to section 18(2) of the
Marine Insurance Act 1905, in <i>Pan Atlantic </i>Lord Goff, accepted at 517C
and 517E respectively that in gauging materiality it suffices if the
misrepresentation (or non-disclosure) had “an impact on the mind” or an
“influence on the judgment”. In the same case Lord Mustill adopted references
to inducement not being established where the misrepresentation (at 545E) “did
not influence the judgment”, (at 546C) “did not influence the mind” or (at
551C) “had no effect on the decision”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 6.6 of his judgment (quoted at para 15 above) the judge held
that the continuing representations influenced Zurich into agreeing to a higher
level of settlement that it would otherwise have done. The judge was entitled
to adopt the proposition in <i>Clerk and Lindsell</i> that “the claimant must
have been influenced by the misrepresentation”.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>In para 28 of his judgment Briggs LJ said this:</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my judgment the authorities on
rescission for misrepresentation speak with one voice. For a misstatement to be
the basis for a claim to rescind a contract, the claimant must have given some
credit to its truth, and been induced into making the contract by a perception
that it was true rather than false. Where judges and text-book writers have
used the word ‘influenced’ as the touchstone for reliance they have done so in
order to allow for belief in the truth of the misrepresentation to be a
contributory rather than sole cause of the representee’s entry into the
contract: see for example Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (21st ed) para 18-35.
They have not thereby intended to allow in any case where the representee can
show that he was influenced into making the contract by the mere making of a
representation which he did not believe was true.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would not accept this analysis. As I see it, the representee’s
reasonable belief as to whether the misrepresentation is true cannot be a necessary
ingredient of the test, because the representee may well settle on the basis
that, at any rate in a context such as the present, he thinks that the
representation will be believed by the judge. But it is centrally relevant to
the question of inducement and causation. Logically, the representee is more
likely to settle for a different reason other than the representation, if his
reasonable belief is that it is false. One of the extraneous factors in this
case, for example, was the fact that the insurers’ expert Mr Sharp had failed
to produce, in their view, a report which set out the extent of the
misrepresentations with sufficient clarity - see para 15 above.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>As to sub-para (ii), multiple causes, the text books strongly support
the proposition that it is sufficient for the misrepresentation to be an
inducing cause and that it is not necessary for it to be the sole cause: see eg
<i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 32nd ed, volume 1, para 7-37. See also, for
example, <i>Barton v Armstrong </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1973/1973_27.html">[1976] AC 104</a>, where Lord Cross, delivering
the majority advice of the Privy Council in a case involving duress by threats
of physical violence, invoked, as an appropriate analogy, the treatment of
contributing causes in fraud cases. He said at p 118G-H:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If it were established that Barton
did not allow the representation to affect his judgment then he could not make
it a ground for relief. … If on the other hand Barton relied on the
misrepresentation Armstrong could not have defeated his claim to relief by
showing that there were other more weighty causes which contributed to his decision
… for in this field the court does not allow an examination into the relative
importance of contributing causes …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hoffmann made much the same point in <i>Standard
Chartered Bank Ltd v Pakistan National Shipping Corpn Ltd (Nos 2 and 4)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/43.html">[2003] 1 AC 959</a>, paras 15-16:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“if a fraudulent representation is
relied upon, in the sense that the claimant would not have parted with his
money if he had known that it was false, it does not matter that he also had
some other negligent or irrational belief about another matter and, but for
that belief, would not have parted with his money either. The law simply
ignores the other reasons why he paid.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hoffmann then quoted with approval the part of the
advice of Lord Cross quoted above and added:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This rule seems to me to be based

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Finally, reliance is placed upon the decision of the High

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The representation need not be

</span>As to sub-para (iii), the “presumption” of inducement, it is not a
presumption of law but an inference of fact. For example, <i>Chitty </i>on

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Once it is proved that a false
statement was made which is ‘material’ in the sense that it was likely to induce
the contract, and that the representee entered the contract, it is a fair
inference of fact (though not an inference of law) that he was influenced by
the statement, and the inference is particularly strong where the misrepresentation
was fraudulent.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mustill put it in this way in <i>Pan Atlantic </i>at p 551. He said
that the representor:</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… will have an uphill task in
persuading the court that the ... misstatement ... has made no difference …
[T]here is a presumption in favour of a causative effect.”</p>

where fraudulent material misrepresentations have been deliberately made with a
view (as I find) improperly to influence the outcome of the negotiation of the
cont[r]act in favour of the maker and his principal, by an experienced player

achieved his objective, at least to the limited extent required by the law,
namely that his fraud was actively in the mind of the recipient when the
contract came to be made.”</p>

</span>As to sub-para (iv), rebutting the presumption of inducement, the
authorities are not entirely consistent as to what is required to rebut the
presumption. However, it is not strictly necessary to address those differences
in this case because, however precisely the test is worded - whether what must
be proved is that the misrepresentation played ‘no part at all’ or that it did
not play a “determinative part”, or that it did not play a ‘real and
substantial part’ - I would accept the submission made on behalf of Zurich that
the presumption is not rebutted on the facts as found in this case. There can
be no doubt on the judge’s findings of fact that, if Zurich had known the true
position as to Mr Hayward’s state of recovery, it would not have offered
anything like as much as it in fact offered and settled for in October 2003.</a></p><a name="para36">

authorities seem to me to support the conclusion that it is very difficult to
rebut the presumption. As it seems to me, the orthodox view is contained in <i>Sharland

allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“can it be permitted to a party

been a full communication of the truth?”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In <i>Sharland v Sharland </i>Baroness Hale observed of <i>Smith
v Kay</i> that it indeed held that a party who has practised deception with a

</span>As to sub-para (v), I would accept the submissions made on behalf of
Zurich. In particular I agree that the representee has no duty to be careful,
suspicious or diligent in research. As Rigby LJ put it in <i>Betjemann v

inquire? To whom does he owe that duty? Certainly not to the person who had
committed the concealed fraud.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Here Zurich did as much as it reasonably could to
investigate the accuracy and ramifications of Mr Hayward’s representations

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As explained above, the questions whether Zurich was induced to enter
into the settlement agreement and whether doing so caused it loss are questions
of fact, which were correctly decided in its favour by the judge. I accept the
submission that the fact that the representee (Zurich) does not wholly credit
the fraudster (Mr Hayward) and carries out its own investigations does not
preclude it from having been induced by those representations. Qualified belief
or disbelief does not rule out inducement, particularly where those
investigations were never going to find out the evidence that subsequently came
to light. That depended only on the fact that Mr and Mrs Cox subsequently came
forward. Only then did Zurich find out the true position. As Mr Hayward knew,
Zurich was settling on a false basis.</a></p><a name="para40">

Hayward, or by the Court of Appeal in his favour justifies its decision. They

LJ stressed, in his analysis in para 24, that Kyle Bay “was not on all fours
with the present case”, but that it was illustrative of a similar principle. To
my mind it is of no real assistance because it was a case which, as Neuberger
LJ observed in <i>Kyle Bay </i>at para 42, involved unusual facts and in which
the approach of the claimant appeared mystifying. That is not the position
here.</p>

in the Court of Appeal Underhill LJ referred at para 12 to <i>Sprecher Grier

relevant discussion of a principle to the effect that belief in the
representation is required before a settlement such as this can be set aside.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to sub-para (vi), knowledge of falsity, as I understand it, it is
accepted on behalf of Zurich that, where the representee knows that the
representation is false, he cannot succeed. There is some support in the
authorities for this view. So, for example Chitty says at para 7-036,</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The burden of proving that the
claimant had actual knowledge of the truth, and therefore was not deceived by

part of the representee is of course a complete defence, because he is then
unable to show that he was misled by the misrepresentation.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the 5th ed (2014) of Spencer Bower &amp; Handley on
Actionable Misrepresentation at p 122, para 11.07 say this.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A representee cannot be misled by
a statement which he knew to be false. … The representee’s knowledge of the
truth must normally be full and complete. Partial and fragmentary information,
or mere suspicion, will not do, ‘suspicion, doubt and mistrust do not have the
same consequence as knowledge’. A representee who knows that the representation
was false to some extent, but acts on it, may establish inducement if the
departure from the truth was significantly greater than expected.”</p>

knowledge of the facts here. It follows that it is not necessary to express a
final view on the question whether it always follows from the fact that the
representee knows that the representation is false that he cannot succeed. As
explained earlier, questions of inducement and causation are questions of fact.
It seems to me that there may be circumstances in which a representee may know
that the representation is false but nevertheless may be held to rely upon the

</span>This very case could have been such a case. The judge considered this
possibility in para 2.5 of his judgment (quoted at para 14 above), where he
said:</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“At the very least, statements
made in the course of litigation will be viewed with healthy scepticism and
weighed against the other material available. Often the other party will not be
sure, even then, whether the statement is in fact true and will mainly concern
himself with how likely it is to be accepted by the court. <i>Sometimes (a
staged road traffic ‘accident’ for example) the other party may actually be
certain from his own direct knowledge that the statement is a deliberate lie.
But even then he and his advisers cannot choose to ignore it; they must still
take into account the risk that it will be believed by the judge at trial</i>.
This situation is quite different from a proposed purchase, where if in doubt
one can simply walk away.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It seems to me that in the kind of case which I have put

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Bogus or fraudulently inflated personal injury claims are not new. One
of the great advocates of the 20th century, Sir Patrick Hastings, recounted
vividly in his memoirs, “Cases in Court” (William Heinemann Ltd, 1949, pp 4 to
20), how as a young barrister before World War 1 he built up a practice
defending insurance companies against such claims. Now as then, they present a
serious problem. Personal injury claims usually fall to be met by insurers and
the ultimate cost is borne by other policy holders through increased premiums.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Insurers may often have grounds for suspicion about a claim but lack the
hard evidence necessary to prove fraud. To pursue an allegation of fraud
without strong evidence is risky. If in such circumstances insurers settle a
claim, not in the belief that it is bona fide but in the belief that it is
likely to succeed, and if afterwards they discover evidence which proves that
the claim was fraudulent, can they bring proceedings to set aside the agreement
and recover damages for deceit? In this case the judge at first instance said
yes, but the Court of Appeal said no, because in such circumstances the
insurers were not deceived. The question which court gave the right answer is
important, both for insurers and for those who advise personal injury
claimants.</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="ParaHeading">Strike out application</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal rightly rejected Mr Hayward’s application to strike
out the action on the ground that the issue was res judicata or that the action
was an abuse of the process of the court: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/641.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 641</a>. The claim had been
compromised by an agreement but, as Lord Bingham emphasised in <i>HIH Casualty
and General Insurance Ltd v Chase</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/6.html">[2003] UKHL 6</a>, [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 61,
paras 15 and 16, “fraud is a thing apart” and “unravels all”. Once proved, “it
vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever” (per Denning LJ
in <i>Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1956/6.html">[1956] 1 QB 702</a>, 712, cited by Lord
Bingham). I refer to this matter because in his judgment now under review
Underhill LJ called into question the correctness of the Court of Appeal’s
earlier judgment, and Mr Hayward’s arguments on this appeal were similarly
flavoured with criticism of it, although it was not open to him to attack it
directly.</p>

</span>I would like to pay testimony to the judgment of His Honour Judge
Moloney QC as a model of clarity and cogency. Lord Clarke has set out at, paras
14 and 15, the judge’s self-direction as to the law (para 2.5) and his
application of it to the facts (para 2.6).</a></p><a name="para54">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Briggs LJ’s reasoning was short and direct. He held that for a
misstatement to be the basis for a claim to rescind a contract, the claimant
must have given some credit to its truth and have been induced into making the
contract by a perception that it was true rather than false. He said that when
judges and text-book writers used the word “influenced” as the touchstone for
reliance, they did so in order to accommodate cases where belief in the truth
of the statement was a contributory rather than the sole cause of the
representee’s entry into the contract.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Underhill LJ’s reasoning was somewhat different but led him to the same
place. His starting point was that when a person enters into a contract to
settle a dispute he knowingly takes the risk of making a payment for a claim
which may be ill-founded, and he pays a sum commensurate with his assessment of
that risk. But he said that the risk which a settlor must be taken to have
accepted will depend on the circumstances of the case. A settlor will not
normally be taken to have accepted the risk that the claimant’s case is not
just ill-founded but dishonest. However, if it is sufficiently apparent that
the settlor intended to settle notwithstanding the possibility that the claim
was fraudulent, he will be held to the settlement. The fact that the insurers
had pleaded that the claim was exaggerated for financial gain proved their
awareness of the possibility of fraud, but they chose to settle the claim with
that awareness, and it was contrary to the public interest in the settlement of
disputes for them to be allowed to set aside the settlement.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Underhill LJ was conscious that the logic of this reasoning was that Mr
Hayward’s application to strike out the insurers’ action ought to have
succeeded, contrary to the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision. He described it
as a “debatable point” whether that decision precluded him from deciding the
case on the reasoning which he thought should apply, but he considered that it
was possible to re-cast his reasoning in a form which was perhaps less
satisfactory, but which avoided conflict with the earlier decision. He held
that although in one sense the misrepresentations operated on the mind of the
insurers, that did not constitute reliance in the relevant sense. In deciding
whether to settle, the insurers formed their own independent judgment whether
the claim was likely to succeed, and there was no “relationship of reliance” of
the kind which was required for the insurers’ action to succeed. Ultimately,
therefore, he allowed the appeal on substantially the same ground as Briggs LJ.</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="ParaHeading">Analysis</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To establish the tort of deceit it must be shown that the defendant
dishonestly made a material false representation which was intended to, and
did, induce the representee to act to its detriment. The elements essential for
liability can be broken down under three headings: (a) the making of a
materially false representation (the defendant’s conduct element); (b) the
defendant’s accompanying state of mind (the fault element); and (c) the impact
on the representee (the causation element). Where liability is established, it
remains for the claimant to establish (d) the amount of any resulting loss (the
quantum element).</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this case there is now no issue as to elements (a), (b) and (d). Mr
Hayward made false and material representations to the insurers as well as to the
court, both directly and through what he told the doctors and his own legal
advisers with a view to it being communicated to insurers and to the court. He
did so dishonestly, with the intention of inducing the insurers to pay compensation
to him on a false basis. The judge’s assessment of quantum is not challenged. The
issue concerns element (c).</a></p><a name="para59">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the statement of facts and issues, the parties have identified the
critical issue in these terms: In order to set aside a compromise on the basis
of fraudulent misrepresentation, to show the requisite influence by or reliance
on the misrepresentation,</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>must the defrauded representee prove that it was induced into settlement
because it believed that the misrepresentations were true; or</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>does it suffice to establish influence that the fact of the
misrepresentations was a material cause of the defrauded representee entering
into the settlement?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The parties have raised an additional question as to the circumstances,
if any, in which suspicion by a settlor of exaggeration of the claim precludes
unravelling the settlement when fraud is subsequently established; but insofar
as the question involves any point of law, it is enveloped by the first issue.</a></p><a name="para61">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some torts do not require the claimant to have suffered any detriment.
Trespass is an example. Deceit is not in that category. It is essential to show
that the defendant’s false representation caused the claimant to act to its
detriment. It stands to reason that this should be so. The vice of the
defendant’s conduct consists in dishonestly making a false representation with
the intention of influencing the representee to act on it to its detriment. If
it does not cause the representee to do so, the mischief against which the tort
provides protection will not have occurred. A misrepresentation which has no
impact on the mind of the representee is no more harmful than an arrow which
misses the target.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Inducement is a question of fact. In a typical case the only way in
which a dishonest representation is likely to influence the representee to act
to its detriment will be if the representee is led to believe in its truth. It
is therefore not surprising to find statements by judges in such cases that the
misrepresentee must show that he believed or “relied on” the misrepresentation.</a></p><a name="para63">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Redgrave v Hurd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1881/251.html">(1881) 20 Ch D 1</a>, to which Underhill LJ referred,
is an example. The plaintiff, an elderly solicitor wishing to retire,
advertised for someone to enter into partnership with him and to buy his house.
The defendant responded to the advertisement and negotiations followed, in
which the plaintiff stated that the practice brought him in about £300 a year.
In fact it did not bring in anything like that amount. The parties entered into
partnership and into a separate contract for the sale of the house, which made
no reference to the business. The defendant paid a deposit and was let into
possession. On discovering that the practice was not worth what the plaintiff
had said, the defendant gave up possession and refused to complete the purchase.
It was therefore a classic case of a purchaser who claimed to have entered into
the contract in reliance on the truth of a misrepresentation by the seller. The
plaintiff sued for specific performance; the defendant counterclaimed for
rescission of the contract and damages for deceit. The plaintiff succeeded at
first instance before Fry J, who was not satisfied that the defendant had
proved that he relied on the misrepresentation. The Court of Appeal upheld the
dismissal of the defendant’s counterclaim in deceit on the ground that he had
not sufficiently pleaded or proved dishonesty, but it allowed his appeal on the
issue of rescission on the ground that the facts gave rise to an inference that
he was induced to enter into the contract by the plaintiff’s misrepresentation.
Jessel MR said at p 21:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If it is a material misrepresentation
calculated to induce him to enter into the contract, it is an inference of law
that he was induced by the representation to enter into it, and in order to
take away his title to be relieved from the contract on the ground that the
representation was untrue, it must be shown either that he had knowledge of the
facts contrary to the representation, or that he stated in terms, or shewed
clearly by his conduct, that he did not rely on the representation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Smith v Chadwick</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 187 was another case of a
purchaser who claimed to have entered into the contract in reliance on the
truth of a misrepresentation by the seller. The plaintiff claimed damages for
deceit through having been induced to buy shares in an iron company by false
representations in a prospectus as to the output of the iron works. The House
of Lords held that his claim failed because the critical words of the
prospectus were ambiguous, and the plaintiff had failed to show that he
understood them in a sense which was false. Lord Blackburn surmised, at p 200,
that the plaintiff’s counsel refrained from asking the plaintiff in
examination-in-chief how he understood the wording for fear of receiving a
damaging answer. The case was cited in the present case for the opening passage
in the speech of Lord Selborne LC at p 190:</a></p><a name="para65">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“My Lords, I conceive that in an
action of deceit, <i>like the present</i>, it is the duty of the plaintiff to
establish two things; first, actual fraud, which is to be judged by the nature
and character of the representations made, considered with reference to the
object for which they were made, the knowledge or means of knowledge of the
person making them, and the intention which the law justly imputes to every man
to produce those consequences which are the natural result of his acts: and,
secondly, he must establish that this fraud was an inducing cause to the
contract; for which purpose it must be material, and it must have produced in
his mind an erroneous belief, influencing his conduct.” (Emphasis added)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the same case Lord Blackburn had pertinent things to say about the
fundamental link between fraud and damage in an action for deceit, at p 195:</a></p><a name="para66">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In <i>Pasley v Freeman</i>, 2
Smith’s Leading Cases 66, 73, 86 (8th ed), Buller J says: ‘The foundation of
this action is fraud and deceit in the defendant and damage to the plaintiffs.
And the question is whether an action thus founded can be sustained in a court
of law. Fraud without damage, or damage without fraud, gives no cause of
action, but where these two concur an action lies, per Croke J, 3 Bulst 95.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Whatever difficulties there may be
as to defining what is fraud and deceit, I think no one will venture to dispute
that the plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves damage. In an ordinary
action of deceit the plaintiff alleges that false and fraudulent
representations were made by the defendant to the plaintiff in order to induce
him, the plaintiff, to act upon them. I think that if he did act upon these
representations, he shews damage; if he did not, he shews none.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So far I have been considering the typical case. But it is possible for
a representor to make a false and fraudulent misrepresentation, with the
intention of influencing the representee to act on it to its detriment, without
the representee necessarily believing it to be true. If the representor
succeeds in his object of influencing the representee to act on the
representation to its detriment, there will be the concurrence of fraud and deceit
in the representor and resulting damage to the representee. In principle, the
representee should therefore be entitled to a remedy in deceit.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That inducement is a question of fact, necessary to establish causation
in all cases but not necessarily in the same way, was recognised and well
expressed in the decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <i>Gipps
v Gipps</i> [1978] 1 NSWLR 454. A woman sued her former husband for deceit in
relation to a property settlement which they had entered into at the time of
their divorce. They were joint shareholders in a private company and as part of
the settlement the wife transferred her shares to the husband. The shares were
valued by an independent accountant, but the husband dishonestly contrived to
see that the valuation was a substantial undervaluation. The wife did not trust
the husband and suspected that the shares were worth more than the valuation,
but she did not know the extent of the undervaluation. It was submitted on the
husband’s behalf that if a representee knows that a representation is false in
a material particular, as a matter of law he or she cannot sue in respect of
it. The court rejected that argument.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After referring to various authorities, including particularly the
passage from the judgment of Jessel MR in <i>Redgrave v Hurd</i> set out at
para 64 above, Hutley JA said (at p 460):</a></p><a name="para69">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The question whether a person has
been induced by a statement made to him to enter into an agreement is, in my
opinion, a single issue of fact. No doubt pre-contractual knowledge that the
statement made is not wholly true has a very direct bearing on the resolution
of this question of fact but it does not of itself necessarily provide the
answer. To say that it does is to formulate a different question.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">To state that a person is induced
by a statement is to affirm a causal relation which is a question of fact, not of
law. That being so, it is impossible to apply to any situation a rule which
produces a final result. The trial judge or jury have to answer the question:
Did the misrepresentation cause the representee to enter into the contract, it
being understood that the representation, as was stated in <i>Australian Steel
and Mining Corpn Pty Ltd v Corben</i> [1974] 2 NWLR 202, 207, ‘was among the
factors which induced the contract.’”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some assistance may also be had from the judgment of Hobhouse LJ in <i>Downs
v Chappell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1358.html">[1997] 1 WLR 426</a>, 433, where he said that for a plaintiff to
succeed in the tort of deceit of deceit it is necessary for him to prove that
(1) the representation was fraudulent, (2) it was material and (3) it induced
the plaintiff to act to his detriment. He added that “As regards inducement,
this is a question of fact” and that “The word “reliance” used by the judge has
a similar meaning but is not the correct criterion.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with His Honour Judge Moloney QC’s analysis in para 2.5 of his
judgment. The question whether there has been inducement is a question of fact
which goes to the issue of causation. The way in which a fraudulent
misrepresentation may cause the representee to act to his detriment will depend
on the circumstances. He rightly focused on the particular circumstances of the
present case. Mr Hayward’s deceitful conduct was intended to influence the mind
of the insurers, not necessarily by causing them to believe him, but by causing
them to value his litigation claim more highly than it was worth if the true
facts had been disclosed, because the value of a claim for insurers’ purposes
is that which the court is likely put on it. He achieved his dishonest purpose
and thereby induced them to act to their detriment by paying almost ten times
more than they would have paid but for his dishonesty. It does not lie in his
mouth in those circumstances to say that they should have taken the case to
trial, and it would not accord with justice or public policy for the law to put
the insurers in a worse position as regards setting aside the settlement than
they would have been in, if the case had proceeded to trial and had been
decided in accordance with the corrupted medical evidence as it then was.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For those reasons, which accord to all intents and purposes with the
judgment of Lord Clarke, I too would allow the insurers’ appeal and restore the
order of Judge Moloney.</a></p><a name="para72">

<p class="ParaHeading">Postscript</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was expressly conceded on behalf of the insurers for the purposes of
the present appeal that whenever and however a legal claim is settled, a party
seeking to set aside the settlement for fraud must prove the fraud by evidence
which it could not have obtained by due diligence at the time of the
settlement. It makes no difference to the outcome of the present case and the
court heard no argument about whether the concession was correct. Any opinion
on the subject would therefore be obiter, and since the court has not
considered the relevant authorities (including Commonwealth authorities such as
<i>Toubia v Schwenke</i> [2002] NSWCA 34) or academic writing, it is better to
say nothing about it.</a></p><a name="para73">
