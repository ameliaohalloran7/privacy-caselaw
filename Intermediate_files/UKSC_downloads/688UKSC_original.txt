application made by the appellant, Professor Shanks OBE FRS FREng, for

outstanding benefit to his employer, the third respondent, Unilever UK Central

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In July 1982 Professor Shanks
visited Professor Anthony Turner and Professor John Higgins at Cranfield
University and there he learned of the work they were carrying out into the use
of biosensors for monitoring diabetes. As a result of this visit Professor
Shanks became interested in the possibility of using re-usable or disposable
devices incorporating biosensors for diagnostic applications and in a report
dated 1 August 1982 entitled “Report on new opportunities afforded by electronic
sensors” he identified a number of “new product opportunities”, one of which
was a limited re-use or disposable sensor for monitoring glucose, insulin or
immunoglobulin levels in diabetics.</span></a></p><a name="para3">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It was at about this time that
Professor Shanks conceived his invention. He had often observed how a droplet
of liquid placed on the edge of the glass plates of a liquid crystal display
(“LCD”) was drawn by capillary action into the 10-micron gap between them, and
he realised the same phenomenon would occur with other liquids such as blood or
urine. He also appreciated how it could be used with etched or printed planar
electrodes and enzyme electrochemical techniques he had seen at Cranfield, and
in this way provide a system for measuring the glucose concentration in blood,
serum or urine.</span></a></p><a name="para4">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In October 1982 Professor Shanks
built the first prototype of his invention at home using Mylar film and slides
from his daughter’s toy microscope kit, and bulldog clips to hold the assembly
together. It has since become known as the Electrochemical Capillary Fill
Device or ECFD. He also developed a similar system which uses fluorescence
rather than conductivity and this has become known as the Fluorescent Capillary
Fill Device or FCFD.</span></a></p><a name="para5">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">CRL at that time employed all of
the Unilever group’s UK-based research staff. It was not a trading company and
was a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever plc. Unilever plc and Unilever NV
were parallel parent companies of the Unilever group and were listed on the
London and Amsterdam stock exchanges respectively, but the business of the
group was run as a single entity. Save where from the context otherwise
appears, I will refer to the Unilever group as “Unilever”.</span></a></p><a name="para6">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is accepted by Professor Shanks
that the rights to his inventions belonged to CRL from the outset pursuant to
section 39(1) of the 1977 Act. CRL assigned all these rights to Unilever plc
for £100. Unilever plc retained the rights for the UK, Australia and Canada but
assigned the rights for elsewhere in Europe, Japan and the USA to Unilever NV,
again for £100. Unilever NV later assigned the rights for the USA to a company
which later became Unilever Patent Holdings BV.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On 13 June 1984 Unilever plc filed
UK patent application 8415018 (“the priority application”). It was entitled
“Devices for Use in Chemical Test Procedures” and was directed to both the ECFD
and the FCFD technologies. Professor Shanks was named as inventor. On 12 June
1985 European patent application 0170375 was filed claiming priority from the
priority application. It related only to the ECFD technology and was filed by
Unilever plc for the UK and by Unilever NV for various other contracting
states. Corresponding patent applications were filed in Australia, Canada,
Japan and the USA. It was in relation to the patents which were granted on all
of these applications (“the Shanks patents”) that Professor Shanks made the
application for compensation which is the subject of these proceedings.</span></a></p><a name="para8">

</span>Unilever was not itself interested in developing a business in the field
of glucose testing for this would have required it to compete with companies
which were established in this therapeutic sector. Consequently, relatively
little was done to develop the ECFD technology after the end of 1984. Indeed,
it was regarded by Unilever as far from a key technology. Instead, until 1986,
Unilever and Professor Shanks focused on the FCFD technology which had
potential application in areas of relevance to Unilever’s existing businesses.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Professor Shanks left Unilever in
October 1986 and in October 1987 Unilever sold the FCFD technology, and the
patents it held relating to it, to Ares-Serono Inc. Ares-Serono also took an
option on the ECFD technology but did not exercise it.</span></a></p><a name="para10">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the years that followed
Unilever carried out a good deal of work in the field of pregnancy and
fertility testing where it developed commercially successful products.
Nevertheless, some research into glucose testing was carried out from 1987 to
1994 and, based primarily upon the work of Professor Brian Birch, Unilever
applied for and was granted further patents (“the Birch patents”). It also
maintained the Shanks patents.</span></a></p><a name="para11">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The glucose testing market
expanded considerably in the late 1990s and 2000s, however; and biosensors
incorporating the ECFD technology played an important role in this. Indeed, the
ECFD technology eventually appeared in most glucose testing products. It also
became apparent that, although not vital, it was a technology that most of the
significant companies in the field were willing to pay millions of pounds to
use.</span></a></p><a name="para12">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Unilever never considered
licensing of patent rights to be a key part of its business. Its main purpose
in having patents was to use them to protect its existing commercial
activities. Cross-licensing of unexploited patents was of secondary importance
and out-licensing was of even less interest. Consequently, the resources it
devoted to the activity of out-licensing were relatively limited and, in most
cases, the prospective licensees of the Shanks patents contacted Unilever and
initiated licensing discussions themselves. However, as I have mentioned,
Unilever did keep the Shanks patents in force and it needed significant effort
and skill to conduct the licensing negotiations, albeit not to the extent a
dedicated licensing team would have provided.</span></a></p><a name="para13">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the end seven licences (or sets
of licences) of the Shanks patents were granted by Unilever for a total
consideration of about £20.3m. The hearing officer thought this figure should
be discounted to reflect the inclusion of the Birch patents in all but one of
the licences, producing a net figure attributable to the Shanks patents of
about £19.55m.</span></a></p><a name="para14">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In 1994 management responsibility
for the Shanks and Birch patents (and various other patents) was transferred to
Unipath, another Unilever company. In addition, Unipath took on the bulk of
Unilever’s medical diagnostics business, including its commercially successful
products in the fields of pregnancy and fertility testing.</span></a></p><a name="para15">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In 2001 Unipath and the Shanks and
the Birch patents (and the benefit of the licences under these patents) were
sold to Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc (“IMI”). The hearing officer found
that, of the price paid by IMI, about £5m was attributable to the Shanks patents.</span></a></p><a name="para16">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Unilever’s total earnings from the
Shanks patents therefore amounted to around £24.55m. The hearing officer
estimated that Unilever had incurred costs in prosecuting, maintaining and
licensing the patents of about £250,000. It followed that Unilever’s net
benefit from the patents was about £24.3m which the hearing officer rounded
down to £24m.</span></a></p><a name="para17">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Professor Shanks made his
application for compensation on 9 June 2006. It came on for hearing before Mr
Julyan Elbro, the hearing officer acting for the Comptroller General of Patents
(“the Comptroller”), in March 2012. The hearing lasted for nine days between
March and May of that year. On 21 June 2013 the hearing officer issued his
decision: BL O/259/13. He found that, having regard to the size and nature of
Unilever’s business, the benefit provided by the Shanks patents fell short of
being outstanding.</span></a></p><a name="para18">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The hearing officer went on to
consider what a fair share of the benefit would have been had he considered it
to be outstanding. He had regard to the various matters set out in section 41
of the 1977 Act and concluded that 5% would have been appropriate, amounting to
about £1.2m. He declined to increase this figure to take into account the time
value of money.</span></a></p><a name="para19">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Professor Shanks appealed to the
High Court against the hearing officer’s decision. The appeal was heard by

He dismissed the appeal, holding that the hearing officer had made no
error of principle in finding that the Shanks patents were not of outstanding
benefit to Unilever. However, he continued, had he come to the opposite
conclusion, he would have found that a fair share of the benefit would have
been only 3%. He also held that it was not appropriate to take into account the
time value of money and that in assessing the benefit of the Shanks patents to
Unilever, the sums it had received should be discounted to reflect the payment
of corporation tax.</p>

The court (Patten, Briggs and Sales LJJ) agreed with
Arnold J that the hearing officer had made no error of principle in considering
the issue of outstanding benefit. However, the court unanimously overturned
Arnold J’s finding in relation to the deduction of corporation tax and, by a
majority (Briggs and Sales LJJ), held that there would be cases where the
change in the value of money over time would have to be recognised in
determining whether the benefit was outstanding, and that it was likely to be
relevant in assessing what amounted to a fair share of that benefit.</p>

two different cases. In the first, the invention belongs to the employer from

his or her rights in the invention or any patent or patent application for the

this appeal we are concerned with the first and so section 40(1). In such a
case the employee may be awarded compensation if the invention is of
outstanding benefit to the employer. Of relevance to both cases are section
43(4) which provides that references to a patent and to a patent being granted
are references to a patent and its being granted whether under the law of the
United Kingdom or the law in force in any other country or under any treaty or
international convention; and section 43(7) which provides that “benefit” means
“benefit in money or money’s worth”. The key amendment introduced by the

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The starting point for the
assessment of whether an employee is entitled to compensation is therefore the
identification of the employer. There can be no doubt that, at least in the
ordinary case, Parliament intended the term “employer” to mean the inventor’s
actual employer. Section 39 deals with the ownership of the invention as between
the inventor and his or her employer and requires a consideration of the
employee’s duties; section 40 provides for the compensation of employees for
certain inventions which may belong initially either to the employer or to the
employee and, in an appropriate case, the payment of that compensation by the
employer to the employee; and section 41 deals with the assessment of the
compensation. In all three cases the employer is the inventor’s actual
employer.</span></a></p><a name="para31">

benefit in the hands of the employer. This is not explained in section 40(1)

it explained in section 40(2) which deals with an invention which initially
belonged to the employee. But section 41(1) makes clear that in both cases it
is the benefit which the inventor’s actual employer has derived or may
reasonably be expected to derive from the patent, or from the assignment or

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I now turn to the meaning of the
word “outstanding” in the expression “outstanding benefit”. In <i>GEC Avionics
Ltd’s Patent </i>[1992] RPC 107, 115, Mr Vivian, for the Comptroller, noted
that the statute did not use words such as “significant” or “substantial” and
said the benefit must be something out of the ordinary and not such as one
would normally expect to arise from the results of the duties that the employee
is paid for. The employee failed to establish the patent was of outstanding
benefit because the employer had received substantial orders for equipment not
employing the invention well after its merits were known. In <i>British Steel
PLC’s Patent</i> [1992] RPC 117, 122, Dr Ferdinando, for the Comptroller,
thought the word “outstanding” implied a superlative. The patent related to an
improved valve for controlling the flow of molten metal which was used by the
employer at only one site and on one machine. The claim for compensation was
rejected because the employee failed to establish a number of the benefits for
which he contended, and because the hearing officer felt constrained by the way
the case was presented to assess the proven benefit against all of the profits
and the whole turnover of the employer, of which it represented only a very
small percentage. In <i>Memco-Med Ltd’s Patent </i>[1992] RPC 403, 414, Aldous
J indicated that he did not disagree with the approaches of these hearing
officers and said that the word “outstanding” denoted something special and
required the benefit to be more than substantial or good. The case concerned a
patent relating to an improved unit for preventing the doors from closing on a
person getting into or out of a lift. Sales of the improved unit were of great
importance but were all made to one customer and the evidence suggested that
the business relationship between the employer and that customer would have
been the same whether or not a patent had been granted. So, once again, the
claim failed.</span></a></p><a name="para36">

patents, its business was transformed. The commercial embodiment of the
invention of the patents was an imaging agent which cost a little under £2.5m

between 1993 and 2007 having a total value in excess of £1.3 billion.</span></a></p><a name="para38">

helpful to a point as illustrations of circumstances which were found to fall
each side of the line. But at the end of the day they provide no substitute for
the statutory test which requires the benefit to be outstanding. This is an
ordinary English word meaning exceptional or such as to stand out and it refers
here to the benefit (in terms of money or money’s worth) of the patent to the
employer rather than the degree of inventiveness of the employee. It is,
however, both a relative and qualitative term and so I must now consider the
context in which the question is to be asked and answered. Put another way, in
relation to what must the benefit from the patent be outstanding? Which factors
may be taken into account in making that assessment?</span></a></p><a name="para39">

it is divided into economic units, the relevant unit of the employer’s

this case I find that the reality of the situation is that described by the
defendants: regardless of how the various companies in the Unilever group have
been structured, researchers at Colworth (employed by CRL) were doing work
which was going to be exploited by the group as a whole. Indeed, it is notable
that the whole benefit from the Shanks patents was generated by licensing activity
operated out of the central Unilever companies. Having regard to the size and
nature of the employer’s undertaking therefore requires me to have regard to
whether the benefit from the patents is outstanding in the context of the
Unilever group as a whole.”</p>

</span>Arnold J and the Court of Appeal agreed with the hearing officer. Patten
LJ explained at paras 33 and 34 that an assessment of what constituted the
undertaking based upon the economic and business realities of the employer’s
organisation was the correct approach. He continued that if one took what he
described as a strictly legal approach to the interpretation of the statute it
could be said that the employer was CRL but he rejected this as a possible
conclusion for two reasons: first, that if what he called the strict legal
approach were to govern section 40(1) then it must also apply to section 41(1)
with the consequence that the benefit derived from the patents would be limited
to the nominal payments CRL received upon their assignment and would not include
the sums subsequently received by other companies in the group from licence
fees and the sale of Unipath. Secondly, the earlier decision of the Court of
Appeal in this case was, in his opinion, only consistent with treating CRL’s
undertaking as including the other group companies that received these
payments. He pointed out that the work carried out by the employees of CRL was
intended to enure for the benefit of Unilever as a whole and that he could see
no answer to the reasoning of the hearing officer and his conclusion that the
relevant undertaking in this case was or included Unilever plc and Unilever NV.</a></p><a name="para44">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Upon this further appeal Mr
Patrick Green QC, for Professor Shanks, submits that the hearing officer and
the courts below lost sight of the fact that CRL was Professor Shanks’ employer
and that the entire Unilever group could not sensibly be described as CRL’s
undertaking. Mr Daniel Alexander QC, for Unilever, commends the hearing
officer’s reasoning. He submits that it is unreal to treat CRL as the relevant
undertaking because it never generated any material revenues, was not the
beneficiary of the royalties in question and is and was simply a service
company for the Unilever group.</span></a></p><a name="para45">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Neither of these interpretations
is without difficulty. The submission for Professor Shanks faces the problem
that CRL has in reality received no more than a nominal benefit from the
patents and certainly nothing that could be described as outstanding. As Mr
Alexander fairly says, the real benefits have been received by other Unilever
companies. A partial answer to this is provided by section 41(2) which deems
the benefit derived from the assignment of a patent to a connected person to be
the benefit which could reasonably be expected to be derived if that person had
not been connected. True it is that section 41(2) does not in terms apply to
section 40(1) but, as I have said, I think it must be interpreted in that way.
This is still not a complete answer, however, for the deeming provision does
not, on the face of it, apply to the benefit from other patents arising from
the work at CRL against which the benefits from the patents in issue may be
judged. Mr Green embraces this result, arguing that CRL’s actual profits were
at most about £2m per year and that judged against this figure, the £24.3m
earned from the Shanks patents is plainly outstanding. But that, so it seems to
me, is not comparing like with like. It would artificially and unfairly elevate
the benefit to CRL from the Shanks patents in relation to any benefit it
derived in other ways.</span></a></p><a name="para46">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The interpretation for which
Unilever contends and which was accepted by the hearing officer and on appeal
focuses on the phrase “the employer’s undertaking in section 40(1)”. This, so
it is said, is perfectly apt to describe the larger entity of which CRL is a
part, that is to say, the whole Unilever group. But the problem with this
interpretation is that it strips the phrase from its context. The subsection as
a whole is concerned with the benefit of the patent to the employer and the
assessment of whether that benefit is, in the hands of the employer,
outstanding. Consideration of the size and nature of the employer’s undertaking
is therefore tethered to this assessment. It is not, on the face of it, an
inquiry into the value of the benefit to the group of which the employer is a
part relative to other unrelated aspects of the group’s business.</span></a></p><a name="para47">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgement the correct
approach to the application of section 40 and the one that does least violence
to its language lies between these extremes. It is to look at the commercial
reality of the situation but to do so, in a case such as the present, from the
perspective of the inventor’s employer. Where, as here, a group company
operates a research facility for the benefit of the whole group and the work
results in patents which are assigned to other group members for their benefit,
the focus of the inquiry into whether any one of those patents is of
outstanding benefit to the company must be the extent of the benefit of that
patent to the group and how that compares with the benefits derived by the
group from other patents for inventions arising from the research carried out
by that company. This gives practical and commercial effect to the language of
section 41 and involves a comparison of like with like. Furthermore, it is, in
my opinion, the approach which sits most comfortably with the next aspect of
the analysis, namely the relevance of the size and nature of the employer’s
undertaking.</span></a></p><a name="para48">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Before the Court of Appeal,
Unilever’s central argument on the issue of outstanding benefit was that £24.3m,
though not inconsiderable, was dwarfed by the turnover and profits of Unilever
as a whole. As Patten LJ recorded at para 26 of his judgment, Unilever makes a
wide range of products from Viennetta ice-cream to deodorants which generate
billions of pounds in sales and hundreds of millions of pounds in profits over
the life of the patents which relate to them. It was accepted that the rate of
return on many if not most of these patents was much lower than on the Shanks
patents but that was said not to be enough to make the benefit of the Shanks
patents outstanding when regard was had to the size and nature of Unilever’s
business. This submission found an echo in Mr Alexander’s submissions to this
court for he took us to a graph of Unilever’s profits between 1984 and 2004
against which a plot of the royalty income from the Shanks and Birch patents,
displayed on the same scale, was so close to the base line as to be
indistinguishable from it.</span></a></p><a name="para49">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Green characterised this
submission before the courts below and in this court as “too big to pay”. He
argued that, were it to be accepted, it would be all but impossible for an
employee to establish that the benefit from a patent to a business such as that
of Unilever was outstanding and this would be manifestly unjust to employee
inventors. This found favour with the Court of Appeal to a point. As Patten LJ
explained at para 28, “outstanding benefit” cannot be determined simply by
comparing the income derived from a patent with the overall turnover and
profitability of the employer’s undertaking. But it raises the more fundamental
question as to the relevance of the size and nature of an undertaking to the
assessment of whether the benefit to it from a patent is outstanding and how
these factors should be taken into account.</span></a></p><a name="para50">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgement there is no single
answer to this question. Many different aspects of the size and nature of the
employer’s business may be relevant to the enquiry. For example, the benefit
may be more than would normally have been expected to arise from the duties for
which the employee was paid; it may have been arrived at without any risk to
the business; it may represent an extraordinarily high rate of return; or it
may have been the opportunity to develop a new line of business or to engage in
unforeseen licensing opportunities. In the circumstances of this case and for
the reasons I have given, a highly material consideration must be the extent of
the benefit of the Shanks patents to the Unilever group and how that compares
with the benefits the group derived from other patents resulting from the work
carried out at CRL.</span></a></p><a name="para51">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In some cases it may be possible
to see that a patent has been of outstanding benefit to an employer by looking
at the size and profitability of the whole business. In the <i>Kelly</i> case
(see paras 37-38 above), for example, the benefits of patent protection went
far beyond anything which one would normally expect to arise from the sort of
work the employees were doing. The patents protected Amersham’s business from
generic competition and allowed it to make major deals; and sales of the
patented product accounted for a large proportion of its profits. In short, the
patents transformed its business. Similarly, as Patten LJ explained at para 28,
a straightforward comparison of profitability may be sufficient, in the case of
a smaller company, to show an outstanding benefit without recourse to wider
considerations of the scope of an employee’s duties or the expectations the
employer may have had about the anticipated level of return.</span></a></p><a name="para52">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I also recognise that a large
undertaking may be able to exert greater leverage than a smaller undertaking
when negotiating licence fees. This was a matter to which the hearing officer
referred in para 207 of his judgment. There he explained and I agree that a
particular sum might represent an excellent return for a small undertaking but
might not be so regarded by a large undertaking which was in a position to
spend substantial sums on litigation to enforce its rights. Much the same might
apply to sales of a patented product. A large undertaking might be able to
harness its goodwill and sales force in a way that a smaller undertaking could
not do. These would be appropriate matters to take into account.</span></a></p><a name="para53">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, I think a
tribunal should be very cautious before accepting a submission that a patent
has not been of outstanding benefit to an employer simply because it has had no
significant impact on its overall profitability or the value of all of its
sales. Those profits and sales may have been generated by a range of different
products which have nothing to do with the technology the subject of the
patent; the parts of the business responsible for them may not have contributed
to any commercial success of the patented invention; and they may be a very
poor guide to whether the benefit the employer has derived from the patent is
out of the ordinary. Indeed, I find it very hard to see how a failure
materially to affect the aggregated sales value or overall profitability of the
business could, in and of itself, justify a finding that the benefit of a
patent has not been outstanding.</span></a></p><a name="para54">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Arnold J accepted a submission by
Unilever that in assessing the benefit it received from the Shanks patents, it
was necessary to take into account the amount of tax which it had to pay, and
in doing so he placed some reliance on the decision in <i>Celanese
International Corpn v BP Chemicals Ltd</i> [1999] RPC 203. There Laddie J held
that, in the context of an account of profits derived by a defendant from
infringement of a patent, the defendant could only be required to pay over its
net profits after payment of corporation tax.</span></a></p><a name="para55">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeal disagreed with
Arnold J’s approach and so do I. Section 40(1) is concerned with the assessment
of the benefit of the patent to the employer and whether that benefit is
outstanding. This exercise is quite different from an assessment of the profits
which a defendant has made from its infringing activities and which it has been
ordered to disgorge.</span></a></p><a name="para56">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In this case Dr Osborn, Unilever’s
expert on this issue, quantified the appropriate reduction to be applied to the
benefit Unilever had derived from the patents at 30% on the basis that this was
the average rate of corporation tax which it had to pay in the relevant period,
as calculated from its accounts. Mr Alexander, for Unilever, submitted that Dr
Osborn’s analysis was reasonable and proportionate and that revenues which had
to be paid over in tax, such that they could not be enjoyed by Unilever, could
not count as a benefit.</span></a></p><a name="para57">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I find myself unable to accept Mr
Alexander’s submission for it seems to me artificially to reduce the size of
the benefit before deciding how much compensation should be paid to the
employee. In my judgement the first step is to quantify the benefit and the
next is to decide how much compensation would secure for the employee a fair
share of it. The employee must account for any tax due on that share and the
employer must account for any tax due on the balance. The approach for which Mr
Alexander contends, on the other hand, would mean that the employer has only to
pay to the employee a share of the benefit net of tax but can take the benefit
of any available relief from tax in respect of the moneys he has paid, whilst
the employee will be liable to account for tax on the moneys that he or she has
received. In my judgement the former approach is both fairer and consonant with
the legislative purpose of these provisions.</span></a></p><a name="para58">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It follows that Patten LJ was
right to say at para 43 of his judgment that the incidence of tax is a
consequence of the benefit rather than a part of it. Assessment of the benefit
net of tax would require in every case an investigation of the employer’s tax
position including, among other things, any losses rolled forward.</span></a></p><a name="para59">

indeed, has always contended that Unilever has had the use of the moneys it
derived from the Shanks patents ever since it received them and that this
should be taken into account. As Arnold J noted, Professor Shanks did not rely
upon this contention before him as a basis for challenging the hearing
officer’s decision as to whether the benefit was outstanding. In my judgement
he was right to take that course. The mere passage of time cannot turn a patent
which was not an outstanding benefit into one which was. However, he did rely
on it to increase the size of the benefit of which he should receive a fair
share or, to put it another way, to increase the size of his share if he was
successful in overturning the hearing officer’s decision on the issue of
outstanding benefit. That remains the position on this appeal and it is
convenient to address it now.</span></a></p><a name="para61">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The hearing officer rejected
Professor Shanks’ argument on the basis that there was not enough evidence
before him to justify an increase. The evidence was in his view too
speculative. On appeal, Arnold J held that the time value of the money which
Unilever had received was not a “benefit … derived … from” the Shanks patents
within the meaning of section 41(1). He reasoned that the definition of
“benefit” in section 43(7) coupled with the terms of section 41(1) pointed to
the assessment being made as of the date the money was received; that the time
value of money was not a benefit Unilever derived from the Shanks patents; that
if the time value of money were treated as a relevant benefit the enquiry would
have no temporal end; that Professor Shanks could have brought the claim
earlier than he did; and that, it being common ground that the Comptroller
could not award interest, an award reflecting the time value of money would be
inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</span></a></p><a name="para62">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On further appeal to the Court of
Appeal, Patten LJ held, like Arnold J, that the benefit under section 41(1) was
limited to direct receipts from the exploitation of the patent rights and did
not include any allowance for the fact that the employer had had the benefit of
those receipts for a period of time prior to an award under that section.
However, Briggs LJ, with whom Sales LJ agreed on this issue, came to the
contrary conclusion. He explained, at para 73, that he would expect the time
value of money (or its change in real value over time due to inflation) to be
relevant in the quantification of the inventor’s fair share under section 41(1)
because of the deleterious effect on the real value of money of the likely
substantial time between the employer’s receipt of the benefit and the making
of the order for payment at the end of the proceedings.</span></a></p><a name="para63">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Mr Alexander, for Unilever, now
submits that the approach taken by Patten LJ and Arnold J is the correct one
for the reasons they gave and because it is clear, simple and practical, and
that the alternative, though theoretically attractive in some respects, would
introduce disproportionate complexity, would drive up the costs of proceedings
and would actively reward an inventor who delays in bringing a claim, just as
Professor Shanks did in this case.</span></a></p><a name="para64">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgement Mr Alexander was
correct to describe the approach contended for by Professor Shanks as attractive,
though I would not for my part characterise that attraction as theoretical. To
the contrary, it seems to me to be the approach which accords with justice and
common sense. Professor Shanks seeks an award which reflects the fact that, on
the assumption he prevails on the other limbs of his appeal, he has for many
years been kept out of a fair share of the benefit Unilever has derived from
the Shanks patents.</span></a></p><a name="para65">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Nor, with great respect, am I
persuaded by the reasoning of Arnold J or that of Patten LJ on appeal. That
reasoning has at its heart the proposition that the time value of the money
that Unilever has received is neither a “benefit” nor “derived from” the Shanks
patents. I disagree. I see no reason why the time value of money cannot be a
benefit derived from a patent within the meaning of section 41(1). Unilever has
had the benefit of the licence fees and other moneys derived from the Shanks
patents ever since they were paid. Another legitimate approach, which amounts
to the same thing, is that of the majority in the Court of Appeal. On the
assumption that he wins on the issue of outstanding benefit, Professor Shanks
is entitled to an uplift because the fair share of the benefit should in this
case reflect the deleterious effect on the real value of money of the
substantial time between Unilever’s receipt of the licence fees and other moneys
and its making of any payment of compensation.</span></a></p><a name="para66">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Turning now to Arnold J’s other
reasons for rejecting this part of Professor Shanks’ case, the inquiry under
section 41(1) will in this case end at the time the order for payment is made.
In other cases, in assessing benefit, it may be necessary to look forward. But
that is specifically contemplated by section 41(1) which makes clear that, in
an appropriate case, an award must be such as to secure for the employee a fair
share of the benefit which the employer may reasonably be expected to derive
from the patent. I also reject the suggestion that the approach Professor
Shanks contends for would cut across the statutory scheme. It is true that the
Comptroller has no power to award interest. But that is not what Professor
Shanks seeks and in my opinion there is nothing in the scheme which bars the
Comptroller from having regard to the impact of inflation in assessing the benefit
or what amounts to a fair share of it. As for complexity and delay, there is
nothing unduly complex about an assessment of the impact of time on the real
value of money; nor should the possibility of an uplift encourage delay, for if
in any case the employee has delayed unduly, the Comptroller would no doubt
take that into account in carrying out his assessment.</span></a></p><a name="para67">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In this case there is no finding
by the hearing officer that Professor Shanks was unreasonably slow to make his
application; nor can he be criticised for his conduct of the proceedings. In my
judgement, and on the assumption he is otherwise successful on his appeal,
fairness demands that his award of compensation should reflect the detrimental
effect of time on the value of money.</span></a></p><a name="para68">

</span>The hearing officer carried out his assessment of the appropriate
characterisation of the benefit of the Shanks patents to Unilever by
considering that benefit in a number of ways. He looked at it in the light of
Unilever’s overall profits and turnover, by reference to patents in general, in
the context of Unilever’s licensing activities, in the light of Unilever’s
patent activities and finally, as compared to Unilever’s activities in general.</a></p><a name="para69">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the course of this analysis the
hearing officer made a series of findings and observations which are to my mind
rather striking. He held that there was an extreme disparity in numerical terms
between the benefit Unilever received and the regular salary and £100
assignment fee that Professor Shanks was paid. He observed that there was scant
evidence before him of Unilever’s other licensing activities and that he had
been provided with no example of another licensing deal which had provided
Unilever with an income at or above the level of the Shanks patents. He found
that the Shanks patents had produced a very high rate of return; that Unilever
had made a very small effort to commercialise Professor Shanks’ invention; that
Unilever’s licensing efforts were serious but not exceptional; and that
Unilever had generated the benefit it derived from the Shanks patents at no
significant risk. In drawing his conclusions, he held that the benefit was a
substantial and significant one in monetary terms, and that in comparison with
the benefit to Unilever of other patents, it did stand out.</span></a></p><a name="para70">

point strongly to the conclusion that the Shanks patents were an outstanding

arrive at his conclusion that they were not? I think the key aspects of his
reasoning may be summarised as follows.</span></a></p><a name="para71">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Looking first at Unilever’s
profits and turnover, the hearing officer agreed with Professor Shanks that it was
simplistic to look simply at the figures for the overall turnover or profits of
the undertaking and to say that a given benefit was only a small percentage of
that. He explained that a relatively modest sum might represent an excellent
return for a small company but would not do so for a larger entity, such as
Unilever, which by its nature, for example being able to contemplate greater
expenditure on litigation, could secure a higher return in a negotiation.
Ultimately, he continued, it was a matter of considering the benefit in the
overall context and making an assessment as to whether it was outstanding.</span></a></p><a name="para72">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Turning next to the benefit of the
Shanks patents in relation to patents in general, the hearing officer explained
that there was expert evidence before him on this issue but he found none of it
of much assistance. Instead he reasoned that the assessment had to be carried
out in the context of the employer’s undertaking and that he found it hard to
see how a benefit of a relatively modest sum of, say, £50,000 could be
considered an outstanding benefit in the context of Unilever’s overall budget.</span></a></p><a name="para73">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This was followed by a
consideration of the benefit to Unilever of the Shanks patents in the context
of its licensing activities. Here the hearing officer recognised that the
Shanks patents did stand out in terms of the licensing income they generated
but thought that it did not follow that the benefit was outstanding. How the
benefit was obtained was, in his view, irrelevant. What mattered was whether
the benefit was outstanding in the context of the undertaking as a whole.</span></a></p><a name="para74">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The hearing officer then
considered the benefit to Unilever of the Shanks patents in light of Unilever’s
broader patent activities. Here he referred to the evidence of Dr Mulder who
held the position of Vice President Patents at Unilever. Some years earlier Dr
Mulder had attempted to value Unilever’s patents but he accepted in the course
of his cross examination that his analysis did not produce a value of the
patents in monetary terms but rather in terms of the value of product sales to
which they related. He was therefore unable to identify any other patent which
was more beneficial to Unilever than the Shanks patents.</span></a></p><a name="para75">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Finally, the hearing officer
compared the benefits from the Shanks patents with the benefits generated by
its other activities and referred in this connection to the unchallenged
evidence of Dr Mulder that Unilever had a number of highly successful products,
such as Viennetta ice cream, spreads and deodorants, and that these generated
an income of “many billions of pounds” and “many hundreds of millions of
pounds” of profit over the lifetime of the patents which protected them. He
said this gave some indication of the sorts of sums that could be of great
benefit to Unilever and they were an order of magnitude greater than the
benefit derived from the Shanks patents.</span></a></p><a name="para76">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The hearing officer expressed his
conclusions in these terms:</span></a></p><a name="para77">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“222.&nbsp; Considering the totality of
the evidence, I was left with a clear impression. The benefit provided by the
Shanks patents was a substantial and significant one in money terms - the sort
of sum that Unilever would, on the evidence, worry about … Furthermore, in
comparison to the benefit from other patents to Unilever, from the evidence
before me it does, in Mr Emanuel’s words ‘stand out’. But Unilever makes
profits at an order of magnitude greater on other inventions - albeit primarily
by manufacture and at a much lower rate of return than was provided by the
Shanks patents. Further, this is not such a case as <i>Kelly</i>, where Floyd J
held that without the patents in that case, Amersham would have faced a crisis.
There was no suggestion from either party that the Shanks patents were crucial
to Unilever’s success.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">223.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, taking account
of the size and nature of Unilever’s business, the benefit provided by the
Shanks patents falls short of being outstanding.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Did the hearing officer make an error of principle in
assessing the benefit?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is apparent from the summary in the immediately foregoing section that
a central and essential part of the hearing officer’s reasoning was that
Unilever generated a vast income and commensurate profits from the manufacture
and sale of products such as ice cream, spreads and deodorants which had the
benefit of patent protection, and that this income and these profits were an
order of magnitude greater than the benefits Unilever derived from the Shanks
patents. The hearing officer clearly thought that this was highly relevant
because he said in terms that it gave an indication of the sorts of benefits
generated by highly successful products and so the sorts of sums which could be
considered of great benefit to Unilever. This is also apparent from his
conclusion, for in referring to “profits … an order of magnitude greater on
other inventions”, the hearing officer was referring to the overall profits
made by Unilever from the manufacture and sale of these products.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There are in my view a number of
problems with these aspects of the hearing officer’s analysis. First, he
adopted the wrong starting point. Professor Shanks was employed by CRL, and CRL
operated a research facility for the Unilever group. CRL’s undertaking for the
purposes of section 40 of the 1977 Act was the business of generating
inventions and providing those inventions and the patents which protected them
to Unilever for use in connection with its business. It was to the size and
nature of this undertaking, among other things, that the hearing officer was
required by section 40 to have regard in assessing the nature of the benefit to
CRL and Unilever of any such patent. Instead the hearing officer took CRL’s
undertaking to be the whole of the Unilever group and this pervaded the whole
of his evaluation. In my judgement that was wrong in principle.</span></a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"><span style="font-size:
13.0pt"></span></a><a name="para80">80.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Secondly and irrespective of his
starting point and the extent of CRL’s undertaking, the hearing officer’s
particular focus upon the overall turnover and profits generated by Unilever,
as illustrated by the size of its business in making and selling ice cream,
spreads and deodorants, was in my view misdirected. The success of these
products could no doubt be attributed to a range of factors including quality,
branding and pricing. It is also true that they were protected at least to some
degree by patent families which related to the processes by which they were
made or aspects of the technology which they contained. But, as the hearing
officer himself acknowledged, only a proportion of the sale price of any
product could be attributed to any patent protection, and Unilever’s attempts
to assess the value of these other patents failed. Indeed, the hearing officer
recognised that, in terms of the benefit which Unilever’s patents had
generated, the Shanks patents stood out.</span></a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Thirdly, it cannot be said that
the size and success of Unilever’s business as a whole played any material part
in securing the benefit it has enjoyed from the Shanks patents. That benefit
was generated by licensing or selling its patent rights, not by harnessing its
manufacturing capacity, its sales and distribution facilities or its goodwill.
The licence fees, which constituted the main part of the benefit, were paid by
licensees who, with one exception, approached Unilever. It is true that
Unilever’s licensing personnel negotiated those licences with skill and serious
effort but its costs of doing so were modest and taken into account, and the
hearing officer made no finding to the effect that the royalty rates were
boosted by the application of Unilever’s financial muscle or the threat of
legal proceedings. These were matters he failed properly to take into account.</span></a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Fourthly, the hearing officer
appeared rightly to disavow an approach which involved assessing the extent and
nature of the benefit derived from a patent simply by comparing it to the
patent owner’s overall turnover or profits. But he also indicated these matters
might be relevant if, for example, an undertaking’s size enabled it to exert
greater leverage. Yet, having apparently rejected such an approach, he then
adopted it. There was no justification here for simply weighing the sums
Unilever generated from the Shanks patents against the size of its turnover and
overall profitability in products such as Viennetta ice cream, spreads and
deodorants and yet this formed an important part of his assessment.</span></a></p><a name="para82">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am conscious that the decision of the hearing officer on this issue
necessarily involved an evaluation and it is of course well established that an
appellate court should be very cautious in differing from such an evaluation
unless it involves an error of principle: see, for example, <i>Biogen Inc v
Medeva plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/18.html">[1997] RPC 1</a>, 45 per Lord Hoffmann. That is particularly so
where the decision is that of a specialist tribunal. What constitutes an error
of principle was considered most recently by Lord Hodge in <i>Actavis Group PTC
EHF v ICOS Corpn</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/15.html">[2019] UKSC 15</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2019/15.html">[2019] Bus LR 1318</a>, paras 80-81. As he
there explained, such an error is not confined to an error as to the law but
extends to certain types of error in the application of a legal standard to the
facts in an evaluation of those facts. A legal error might involve asking the
wrong question, failing to take into account relevant matters or taking into
account irrelevant matters. In the absence of such an error, the appeal court
would be justified in differing from a tribunal’s assessment if it were to
reach the view that the tribunal’s conclusion was outside the bounds within
which reasonable disagreement was possible.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para84"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I am satisfied that, for the
reasons given in paras 79-82 above, the hearing officer was wrong in principle
and that Arnold J on appeal and the Court of Appeal on further appeal wrongly
failed so to hold. Further, having regard to the fundamental nature of these
errors, the decision of the hearing officer must be set aside. I have
considered whether it is necessary to remit this appeal for a rehearing but I
have concluded it is not, for it seems to me to be clear how the hearing
officer would or ought to have decided this issue had he directed himself
correctly. I would add that this is a conclusion at which I am relieved to
arrive in the light of the time these proceedings have taken and the costs that
must have been incurred.</span></a></p><a name="para84">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In summary and as I have
foreshadowed, Professor Shanks made his invention using his own initiative for
his brief was to work in the area of biosensors for process control and process
engineering and he was made to understand that he should not stray too far from
it. He built the first prototype of his invention in October 1982, some five
months after he had joined CRL. This would have been a new product area for
Unilever but it was a development which the group did not, in the hearing
officer’s terminology, get behind and push. It was regarded as far from a key
technology and it was one into which Unilever made only a modest investment. It
is true that Unilever patented and maintained a patent portfolio which
protected it and in due course expended significant effort and skill in the
licensing negotiations. But the rewards it enjoyed were substantial and
significant, were generated at no significant risk, reflected a very high rate
of return, and stood out in comparison with the benefit Unilever derived from
other patents. What was more, they could not be attributed to the deployment or
application of Unilever’s wider business assets or infrastructure; nor were
they found to be the consequence of any leverage Unilever could exert because
of its size. In short, the benefit Unilever enjoyed from the Shanks patents was
outstanding within the meaning of section 40 of the 1977 Act.</span></a></p><a name="para85">

<p class="ParaHeading">Fair share</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Section 41 of the 1977 Act says
that an award of compensation to an employee under section 40(1) or (2) shall
be such as will secure for the employee a fair share, having regard to all the
circumstances, of the benefit which the employer has derived or may be
reasonably expected to derive from the patent. Section 41(4) then specifies
that various matters must be taken into account.</span></a></p><a name="para86">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In assessing what would have been
a fair share of the benefit Unilever had derived from the Shanks patents, the
hearing officer duly addressed each of the matters set out in section 41(4). In
so doing he had regard to the nature of Professor Shanks’ duties and that he
was employed to invent; Professor Shanks’ remuneration, which was commensurate
with his level of responsibility; the effort and skill Professor Shanks
expended in making the invention; the contribution made by Unilever to the
making, developing and working of the invention; and Unilever’s licensing
effort which, the hearing officer observed, was serious but not exceptional.
The hearing officer also had regard to the evidence before him about the
percentage award rates in company and university employee compensation schemes.
Having regard to all of these matters, the results of a literature review and
the parties’ submissions, he held that 5% would have been the appropriate fair
share of the benefit, had it been outstanding.</span></a></p><a name="para87">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">On appeal, Arnold J came to the
conclusion that an important factor in Unilever’s ability to extract licence
fees was the fact that it could afford to bring proceedings for patent
infringement and pursue them to a conclusion, and that the hearing officer had
wrongly failed to take this into account. In these circumstances he thought
that it would not be right to award to Professor Shanks a percentage of the
benefit which was higher than the 3% awarded to the inventors in the <i>Kelly</i>
case, and that this would have been the fair share of the benefit to award to
Professor Shanks, had that benefit been outstanding. On further appeal, the
Court of Appeal did not need to address this issue and did not do so.</span></a></p><a name="para88">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Professor Shanks now contends that
Arnold J had no proper basis for reducing the share of the benefit to 3% and
that even 5% is too low, for it fails properly to take into account that he
conceived the invention outside and in addition to his assigned role; that the
licence fees generated by the patent represented an entirely new income stream
for Unilever; and that he made the invention and the patent was exploited at no
risk to Unilever. He argues that between 10% and 20% of the benefit would
represent a fair share.</span></a></p><a name="para89">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my judgement Arnold J was wrong
to find that 3% represented a fair share of the benefit Unilever enjoyed from
the Shanks patents. The hearing officer had well in mind the size of Unilever’s
business and the nature of the licensing negotiations yet he did not make a
finding that it secured the licence rates it did because it could afford to
bring and pursue infringement proceedings against the prospective licensees.
The absence of such a finding is not at all surprising. Unilever had no
manufacturing business it needed to protect and, with one exception, the
discussions were initiated by the prospective licensees. In substance, these
were negotiations between willing licensors and willing licensees. Arnold J
therefore had no basis for reducing the percentage from 5% to 3%.</span></a></p><a name="para90">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I am not persuaded by Professor
Shanks’ other arguments, however. The hearing officer found that the invention
was made in the course of his contractual duties, although its subject matter
was not the main focus of his work. Moreover, as the hearing officer also
found, Professor Shanks was employed to invent and, in making the invention,
did what he was employed to do. I accept that the patent generated a new stream
of income for Unilever, but it did not do so without its input. To the
contrary, it was brought to fruition by Unilever’s negotiation of the licences,
and that is something in which Professor Shanks played no part. Finally, it is
true that Unilever made only a relatively small effort to commercialise the
invention and exploited the Shanks patents at no real risk to itself, but these
were matters which the hearing officer took into account in arriving at his
figure of 5%. I am satisfied that the hearing officer made no error in the way
he approached this issue and it would not be appropriate to interfere with the
conclusion to which he came.</span></a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It only remains to apply to the 5%
share of the £24m an uplift to reflect the impact of time on the value of
money. Professor Shanks invites us to take 1999 as the median year in which
Unilever received the benefit and then to take into account the effect of
inflation using the Bank of England calculator. I did not detect any
substantive objection from Unilever to this methodology and I think it is a
reasonable and fair way to proceed. This produces a figure of about £2m at an
average inflation rate of 2.8%. In my judgement the fair share of that benefit
to which Professor Shanks is entitled is therefore £2m.</span></a></p><a name="para92">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">For these reasons I would allow
Professor Shanks’ appeal. In my judgement the Shanks patents were of
outstanding benefit to Unilever and CRL and Professor Shanks is entitled to a
fair share of that benefit amounting to £2m.</span></a></p><a name="para93">
