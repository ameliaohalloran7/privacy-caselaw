</span></a></span><a name="para1"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This appeal is concerned with the
entitlement of a taxpayer to deduct input VAT and claim repayment of surplus
input VAT. It concerns the interpretation of articles 167 and 168(1) of Council
Directive (EC) 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value
added tax (“the Principal VAT Directive” or “the PVD”) and the case law of the
Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) relating to those articles. In
short, the question is whether a taxpayer can deduct as input tax the VAT which
it has incurred in purchasing entitlements to an EU farm subsidy, the Single
Farm Payment (“SFP”). The taxpayer has used those entitlements to annual
subsidies over several years and intends to use money resulting from the
receipt of those subsidies to fund its current and future business activities,
which currently involve only taxable supplies.</span></a></p><a name="para1">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The factual background to this
appeal involves an interesting business model. Frank A Smart &amp; Son Ltd
(“FASL”) is a Scottish company which carries on a farming business in
Aberdeenshire. FASL is wholly-owned by Mr Frank Smart, who is its sole
director. Mr Smart and his wife are the partners in a partnership which owns
Tolmauds Farm, a farm of about 200 hectares which the partnership leases to
FASL for a rent of £30,000 per year. FASL produces beef cattle and certain
crops at Tolmauds Farm. FASL’s whole output from its business was and is
taxable under the VAT regime.</span></a></p><a name="para2">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">FASL received SFPs from the
Scottish Government. SFPs were agricultural subsidies which between 2005 and 2014
were paid to farmers who had eligible land at their disposal on 15 May of each
year and who met the requirements of ensuring plant and animal health and
maintaining the land in question in “Good Agricultural and Environmental
Condition” (“GAEC”). The farmer did not have to cultivate the land or stock it
with animals in order to meet the GAEC requirement. When the scheme was
initiated in 2005, farmers in the United Kingdom were allocated initial units
of entitlement to single farm payments (“SFPEs”) for no consideration. The
SFPEs were tradeable and a market in them developed over time.</span></a></p><a name="para3">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">FASL took advantage of the market
in SFPE units to accumulate a fund for the development of its business. With
the assistance of bank funding, it spent about £7.7m between 2007 and 2012 on
purchasing 34,477 SFPE units in addition to its initial allocation of 194.98
units for Tolmauds Farm. In this period FASL paid VAT on the SFPE units which
it purchased and it has sought to deduct that VAT as input tax. In order to
receive the SFPs to which the purchased SFPE units entitled it, FASL leased a
further 35,150 hectares of land under seasonal lets. FASL did not cultivate or
stock this land. The leases were typically qualified by an agreement, entered
into after the lease, which allowed the landlord to stock the land or cultivate
it himself, provided that the ground was kept in GAEC. This was done to
preserve FASL’s entitlement to SFPs. The rent payable for the seasonal lets was
generally about £1 per acre but could be up to £10 per acre.</span></a></p><a name="para4">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The result of this business model
was that between 2010 and 2013 (in each case FASL’s financial year ending on 30
September) FASL’s income from subsidies, which were principally SFPs, dwarfed
its income from cattle sales from Tolmauds Farm. FASL received SFPs of
£1,166,290 in 2010, £1,761,205 in 2011, £2,488,949 in 2012 and £3,285,650 in
2013. The parties presented the court with agreed figures derived from the
profit and loss accounts of FASL in those financial years:</span></a></p><a name="para5">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”),
to whom FASL appealed against HMRC’s refusal to allow it to deduct VAT of
£1,054,852.28 in its quarterly VAT returns between December 2008 and June 2012,
made important findings of fact (in para 38 of its decision) which have a
bearing on the outcome of this appeal. The FTT found that when it purchased the
SFPE units, FASL intended to apply the income which it received from the SFPs
to pay off its overdraft and to develop its business operations. The SFPs were
accumulated in FASL’s bank account and have been used to pay off its overdraft.
Tolmauds Farm was worked during the relevant period by Mr Smart and one of his
sons, Roderick, on a full-time basis and another son assisted for part of that
period. FASL had no other employees. During the relevant period FASL did not
increase its stock numbers on the farm significantly. But FASL had been
contemplating three principal developments of its business. First, from about
2011, FASL was considering establishing a windfarm. It spent over £119,000 on
preliminary investigations, including technical information and costings, on
investigating community responses and on a planning application and enquiries.
Secondly, other proposed developments have included the construction of further
farm buildings, including cattle courts and a Dutch barn. FASL has undertaken
site preparation works for an additional cattle court and has made the needed
planning applications. Thirdly, FASL has been considering the purchase of
neighbouring farms, which were expected to come on to the market for sale.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Based on those findings of fact,
the FTT concluded (para 39) that the acquisition of the SFPE units was a
funding exercise which related to FASL’s business overheads in its farming
enterprise. FASL had raised finance for its future economic activities as a
whole. There was a direct and immediate link between the expenditure and FASL’s
future taxable supplies. The FTT stated the conclusion based on its findings of
primary fact that the funding opportunity afforded by the purchase of the SFPE
units did not form a separate business activity of FASL but was “a wholly
integrated feature of the farming enterprise” and not a separate enterprise
(para 42). The FTT therefore allowed FASL’s appeal.</span></a></p><a name="para8">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">HMRC appealed to the Upper
Tribunal (Lord Tyre), which confirmed the FTT’s findings of fact, which were by
then uncontroversial, and refused the appeal, finding that the FTT had not
erred in law. HMRC then appealed with the permission of the Upper Tribunal to
the Inner House of the Court of Session. An Extra Division of the Inner House
(Lord Menzies, Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young) in a judgment delivered by
Lord Drummond Young dated 8 December 2017 (</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/scot/cases/ScotCS/2017/[2017]_CSIH_77.html">[2017] CSIH 77</a>) dismissed HMRC’s
appeal. HMRC now appeals to this court with its permission.</p>

</span>Before setting out HMRC’s challenge it may be useful to discuss the
basic structure of the VAT system so far as relevant. In order to understand
the case law, which I will discuss, it is necessary also to set out relevant provisions
of the PVD as they show the central importance to the question of
deductibility, which arises in this appeal, of the connection between input
expenditure and the economic activity which a taxable person is carrying on or
intends to carry on.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>In the provision of goods or services for consideration there is often a
chain of production or supply from raw material to finished product. At its
simplest, VAT is a tax on the value added by a supplier of goods to its
purchases of raw materials or goods upon sale of the product. The same
principle extends to the supply of services. Under the common system of VAT in
the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union, the taxation of the value
so added by the particular supplier is achieved by calculating the tax due on
the output of the supplier at the specified rate (“output tax”) and deducting
from that sum the VAT which that supplier has paid on the components of that
output or on general overheads of the business which are cost components of its
taxable outputs (“input tax”).</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principle of the common
system of VAT entails the application to goods and services of a general tax on
consumption exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services,
however many transactions take place in the production and distribution process
before the stage at which the tax is charged.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">On each transaction, VAT,
calculated on the price of the goods or services at the rate applicable to such
goods or services, shall be chargeable after deduction of the amount of VAT
borne directly by the various cost components.”</p>

effected, is set out, so far as relevant, in articles 167 and 168, which

which is deductible from the output tax due on those taxable supplies. The

Schedule 9, which do not give rise to a right to deduct input tax. Further, the
taxable person may engage in activities which are not “economic activities”
under article 9 of the PVD and are outside the scope of the VAT regime. VAT
incurred by the taxable person on supplies which are used as components of such
non-economic activities are not deductible.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>HMRC submit that the Inner House erred in law because, on a proper
analysis, FASL acquired the SFPE units to generate the receipt of SFPs, which
was a form of investment income outside the scope of VAT. The receipt of the
SFPs was a non-economic activity. Input tax incurred in acquiring the SFPE
units was not recoverable because there was a direct and immediate link between
the expenditure on those units and the receipt of the SFPs. There was no direct
and immediate link between the acquisition of the SFPE units and a taxable
output transaction by FASL. Secondly, HMRC submit that the Inner House erred in
treating the VAT incurred on the purchase of the SFPE units as deductible on
the basis that it was a general overhead of FASL’s business. This is again
because the expenditure was directly and immediately related to the receipt of
the SFPs, which was outside the scope of the VAT system. Thirdly, HMRC submit
that the FTT, the Upper Tribunal and the Inner House each erred in taking into
account an irrelevant consideration, namely the evidence of Mr Smart’s
intention, as the director of FASL, to use the funds generated by the receipt
of the SFPs to fund the development of FASL’s business which would involve the
making of taxable supplies in future.</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>Mr Kieron Beal QC, who presented the case for HMRC skilfully, makes two
central submissions. First, he relies on the judgment of the CJEU in <i>BLP
Group plc v Customs and Excise Comrs</i> (Case C-4/94) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C494.html">[1996] 1 WLR 174</a> (“<i>BLP</i>”)
in support of the proposition that VAT which a taxable person has paid on costs
incurred directly and immediately in relation to an exempt supply cannot be
reclaimed as input VAT even if the outcome of the expenditure is to produce
funds which are used or will be used to subsidise the taxable person’s
downstream taxable activities. Secondly, he submits that there is no reason in
fact or law for reaching a different conclusion in relation to costs incurred
directly and immediately in relation to a transaction which is outside the
scope of VAT. If there is any doubt on this matter, HMRC invite the court to
refer a question or questions to the CJEU under article 267 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (“the TFEU”).</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">FASL’s response</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr David Small, advocate, in a succinct and skilful submission, founds
on the principle of neutrality: the VAT system gives fully taxable traders, in
other words people, such as FASL, who make only taxable supplies, a right to
recover all input tax incurred in raising finance for their business so long as
(i) the finance which they raise is spent on funding the business which goes on
to make further taxable supplies and (ii) the financing exercise itself remains
outside the scope of VAT because it does not involve the taxable person in
making any taxable or exempt supplies. FASL does not dispute that if it were in
the future to use part of the funds, which it has obtained through the receipt
of SFPs and kept in its bank account, on downstream activities which were
outside the scope of VAT, that use would restrict the input tax to which it had
been entitled and might give rise to an obligation to repay a proportionate
part of any deduction which it had made or any repayment of VAT which it had
received from HMRC. Disagreeing with HMRC, FASL submits that the case law of
the CJEU is clear and supports its position.</a></p><a name="para23">

</span>I am persuaded that Mr Small is correct in his submission that FASL is
entitled to deduct input VAT incurred in its acquisition of the SFPE units and
that the tribunals and the Inner House did not err in law in so concluding.
Because the answer to the question lies in an analysis of the jurisprudence of
the CJEU in relevant cases, and because HMRC submit that the matter is not acte
clair, it is necessary to examine the relevant cases with care.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>Before turning to the cases about which there is a dispute, it is
necessary to set the scene by considering <i>Mohr v Finanzamt Bad Segeberg</i>
(Case C-215/94) [1996] ECR I-959; [1996] STC 328, in which the CJEU held that
an undertaking by a farmer to discontinue milk production, for which he
received compensation, did not constitute a supply of services by him to the EC
institutions or the competent national authorities with the result that the
compensation was not subject to VAT. The CJEU in its judgment (paras 19-23)
observed that VAT was a tax on consumption, and that the authorities on payment
of compensation obtained no goods or services for their own use from the farmer
but acted in the common interest of promoting the proper functioning of the
Community’s milk market.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is not contested in this appeal
that the sales on the market of the SFPE units to FASL were transactions which
fell to be treated as taxable supplies. It is also not contested that a
farmer’s actions to qualify himself to receive SFPs did not amount to the
provision of a service to the relevant authorities and that the receipt of SFPs
was outside the scope of VAT. The central question in the appeal therefore is
whether the receipt of the SFPs, which were transactions outside the scope of
VAT, prevented FASL from deducting the VAT which it has paid on the purchase of
the SFPE units.</span></a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="ParaHeading">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disputed case law</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>BLP </i>a management holding company sold shares in a subsidiary
company and sought to recover as input tax the VAT which it had paid on
invoices for professional services connected to the sale. The share sale was an
exempt transaction. But BLP argued that it was entitled to deduct the VAT as
input tax because the purpose of the sale was to raise funds to pay off debts
which had arisen as a result of its taxable transactions. The legal question
turned on the interpretation of the predecessors of articles 1(2), 168 and 173
of the PVD, namely article 2(2) of EC Council Directive 67/227 (“the First
Directive”) and article 17(2) and (5) of the EC Council Directive 77/388 (“the
Sixth Directive”) and in particular the words “goods and services are used for
the purposes of his taxable transactions” in article 17(2), which remain in
article 168 of the PVD (para 15 above). The CJEU held in para 19 of its
judgment:</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The use [in article 17(5)] of the
words ‘for transactions’ shows that to give the right to deduct under [article
17(2)], the goods or services in question must have a direct and immediate link
with the taxable transactions, and that the ultimate aim pursued by the taxable
person is irrelevant in that respect.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The CJEU went on to point out that the Sixth Directive
provided a right to deduct VAT on goods and services used for exempt
transactions only by way of exception. It recognised (para 25) that if BLP had
taken out a bank loan, instead of selling shares, it would have been able to
deduct VAT on accountants’ professional services required for that purpose
because the costs of those services would form part of the company’s overheads
and hence of the cost components of its products. Thus it held (in para 28):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“article 2 of the First Directive
and article 17 of the Sixth Directive are to be interpreted as meaning that,
except in the cases expressly provided for by those Directives, where a taxable
person supplies services to another taxable person who uses them for an exempt
transaction, the latter person is not entitled to deduct the input VAT paid,
even if the ultimate purpose of the transaction is the carrying out of a
taxable transaction.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that this ruling in terms relates only to the use of
services on exempt transactions. But as HMRC set great store by this case and
submit that its reasoning extends to services used on a form of fund-raising
which is outside the scope of VAT, it is necessary also to cite para 24 of the
CJEU’s judgment in <i>BLP</i>, which suggests that policy considerations might
point to a wider exclusion of the right to deduct:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Moreover, if BLP’s interpretation
were accepted, the authorities, when confronted with supplies which, as in the
present case, are not objectively linked to taxable transactions, would have to
carry out inquiries to determine the intention of the taxable person. Such an
obligation would be contrary to the VAT system’s objectives of ensuring
certainty and facilitating application of the tax by having regard, save in
exceptional cases, to the objective character of the transaction in question.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In <i>BLP</i>, the objective character of the
transactions was that the services were used for an exempt transaction, namely
the sale of shares in a subsidiary by a holding management company. When
addressing the subsequent case law of the CJEU I will have to consider how,
when a taxable person legitimately claims that costs of services are part of
its overheads, the tax authorities are to ascertain that those costs are
eventually cost components of its products or activities in taxable transactions.</p>

</span>In <i>Midland Bank plc v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>(Case C-98/98)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2000/C9898.html">[2000] 1 WLR 2080</a>, the bank was the representative member of a group of
companies, one of which, Samuel Montagu &amp; Co Ltd, provided taxable services
to one of its clients in relation to a proposed corporate takeover and engaged
a firm of solicitors to provide legal services in that connection. To simplify
matters I will present Samuel Montagu &amp; Co Ltd as the bank because the
group was treated as a single person for the purposes of VAT. In a dispute in
relation to the proposed takeover, the bank was sued for damages for negligence
and the bank engaged the same firm of solicitors to represent it in the legal
proceedings. The bank then sought to deduct as input tax the whole of the VAT
which it paid in respect of its legal fees on the ground that it was to be
attributed to its taxable supplies to its client in the takeover. The Customs
and Excise Commissioners (“CEC”) argued that the VAT incurred on the legal fees
relating to the claim for damages was attributable to the bank’s business
generally and, as the bank made both taxable and exempt supplies, fell to be
apportioned in accordance with article 17(5) of the Sixth Directive (now
article 173 of the PVD). The dispute gave rise to questions (i) whether there
needed to be a direct and immediate link between a particular input transaction
and particular output transactions in order to entitle the taxable person to
deduct VAT as input tax and (ii) if so, what was the nature of that link. In
relation to the first question the CJEU applied <i>BLP</i> but (in paras 22 and
23) confirmed, as an exception to the rule in <i>BLP</i>, that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“entitlement to deduct, once it
has arisen, is retained even if the economic activity envisaged does not give
rise to taxed transactions or the taxable person has been unable to use the
goods or services which gave rise to the deduction in the context of taxable
transactions by reason of circumstances beyond his control.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In support of that exception it cited <i>Intercommunale
voor Zeewaterontzilting (INZO) v Belgian State</i> (Case C-110/94) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C11094.html">[1996] ECR I-857</a>, paras 20 and 21 and <i>Belgian State v Ghent Coal Terminal NV </i>(Case

judgment) that:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“in principle, the existence of a
direct and immediate link between a particular input transaction and a
particular output transaction or transactions giving rise to entitlement to
deduct is necessary before the taxable person is entitled to deduct input VAT
and in order to determine the extent of such entitlement.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In relation to the second question the CJEU declined to
define what amounted to a direct and immediate link because of the diversity of
professional and commercial transactions and left it to national courts to
apply the test to the facts of the individual case. But it stated (para 33 and
dispositif 2) that a taxable person which carries out taxable and non-taxable
transactions could deduct the entirety of VAT as input tax only if it could
show by objective evidence that the expenditure involved in the acquisition of
the services was part of the various cost components of the taxable output
transaction.</p>

company, Scottish Mutual Assurance plc (“SM”), in addition to its life
assurance business, carried on business leasing premises for professional and
commercial use. SM opted to charge VAT on the rent received from its commercial
tenants. SM later sold a property in Aberdeen to a third party in a transaction
which CEC, in accordance with domestic legislation, treated as a transfer as a
going concern so that no supply of goods or services had taken place. As a
result, the transfer was not a taxable transaction. SM sought to deduct as
input tax the whole of the VAT which it had paid on professional services
relating to the sale, while CEC took the view that only part of the tax was
deductible and sought to apportion the VAT in accordance with article 17(5) of

</span>In his opinion Advocate General Jacobs contrasted the CJEU’s approach in
<i>BLP</i> in relation to an exempt transaction with other case law which
recognised a right to deduct as input tax VAT incurred as part of the overheads
of a taxable person’s business. In his view, what mattered was whether the
taxed supply was a cost component of a taxable output, and not whether the most
closely-linked transaction was itself taxable. It was inherent in an exempt
transaction that it broke the chain between a supply and the taxable person’s
taxable economic activities. As a result, VAT incurred on supplies used by the
taxable person for an exempt transaction could not be deducted from VAT paid on
a subsequent output supply by that person (para 35). Where no supply of goods
or services had taken place in a transaction outside the scope of VAT, the
chain between a supply to the taxable person and that person’s subsequent
taxable economic activity was not broken. One was required to look beyond the
immediate transaction to see whether the supply, in respect of which a claim to
deduct VAT was made, formed a cost component of some other taxable transaction,
including in the form of general overheads (paras 38, 42 and 46).</a></p><a name="para31">

the CJEU has in its later case law adopted the reasoning of the Advocate
General. To simplify the later discussion of the case law concerning
fund-raising transactions, I will refer to the transaction on which the supply
was used, such as the sale of the subsidiary in <i>BLP</i>, the transfer of the
office in <i>Abbey National</i>, and the purchase of SFPEs and the steps taken
to obtain the SFPs in this case as “the initial transaction” and, adopting the
phrase which Mr Small derived from later CJEU case law, will call the taxable
person’s subsequent transaction or transactions, of which he asserts the
relevant supply is a cost component, as “the downstream transaction”. It is,
admittedly, a simplification to speak of “subsequent transactions” because, as
the Advocate General recognised, there may not always be such a chronological
sequence in economic reality or inherent in the VAT system (para 41). But it is
nonetheless the norm.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>The CJEU in its judgment did not expressly adopt the Advocate General’s
distinction between the chain-breaking effect of the use of a supply in an
initial transaction which is an exempt transaction and the absence of that
break in an initial transaction outside the scope of VAT. But the CJEU’s
reasoning in this case is not only consistent with the Advocate General’s
approach but also difficult to reconcile with its reasoning in <i>BLP </i>unless
it was accepting his approach. In particular, the court rejected the principal
position of the United Kingdom Government (para 20) that, since the costs
incurred to effect the transfer were used for the purposes of an initial
transaction which was not taxable, there was no right to deduct the input VAT
paid on those costs. The CJEU’s reasoning started (para 24) with the principle
of neutrality, namely that the deduction system is meant to relieve the taxable
person entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all
his economic activities (ie his activities that are themselves subject in
principle to VAT paid by the recipient of his goods or services and accounted
to the tax authorities by the taxable person). Referring to <i>BLP</i> and <i>Midland
Bank</i>, the CJEU held (para 28) that the right to deduct VAT borne by goods
and services presupposed that the expenditure incurred in acquiring them was
part of the cost components of taxable output transactions (ie including
taxable downstream transactions). The CJEU found no direct and immediate link
between the professional services and one or more taxable outputs because it
rejected Abbey National’s arguments, including that the transfer of the
property should be treated as if it were a taxable transaction. But that was
not the end of the matter as the CJEU held that the costs of the professional
services formed part of the taxable person’s overheads and as such were cost
components of the products of a business. The services used by SM for the purposes
of the transfer thus had a direct and immediate link with the whole economic
activity of that taxable person (para 36). As the taxable person effected
downstream transactions which were subject to VAT and exempt transactions, it
could only deduct (under article 17(5) of the Sixth Directive) the proportion
of the VAT which was attributable to the taxable transactions (para 42 and
dispositif). The CJEU thus looked through the initial transaction and
recognised a right to deduct by reference to such downstream transactions as
were economic activities.</a></p><a name="para33">

disallowed a deduction of input tax which Kretztechnik had paid on the supply
to it of services linked to the share issue, which the national tax authority
treated as exempt from VAT. The company challenged the assessment to tax and
this gave rise to questions whether the share issue was within the scope of VAT

for the purposes of which the services are used. The transactions in question
will usually be the onward supply of the commodity or the goods or services for

substantial shareholding in another company (“company A”). The CJEU decided the
case without the assistance of an opinion from the Advocate General and
followed its decisions in <i>Midland Bank</i>, <i>Abbey National </i>and <i>Kretztechnik</i>.
The sale of the shares was treated as an activity outside the scope of VAT and
the central question was whether the relevant costs were overheads related to
the taxpayer company’s economic activity as a whole (para 24). It is
nonetheless of interest because in my view it casts light on later judgments of
the CJEU and I will return to the case in this judgment. The consideration for
the 1989 sale was a fixed sum and a further sum which depended upon the profits
earned by company A between 1989 and 1992. At the time of the sale and until 1
January 1993 the taxpayer company was a passive holding company which took no
part in the management of the companies in which it invested. From 1 January
1993 the taxpayer company provided management services to company A. A dispute
arose between the taxpayer company and the purchaser of company A over the
calculation of the sum due by reference to company A’s profits. The taxpayer
company incurred professional costs in an arbitration on that matter and sought
to deduct the VAT which it paid on those costs in the financial year 1996,
which was at a time that it was carrying on economic activity. The CJEU
rejected the taxpayer’s claim in essence because the taxpayer company would
have incurred the professional costs whether or not it had commenced economic
activity after 1 January 1993 (paras 32-33). It distinguished <i>Kretztechnik </i>on
the basis that in that case the costs were incurred in relation to a share
issue intended to increase the taxable person’s capital for the benefit of its
economic activity (paras 35-37). Accordingly, the CJEU held (para 38 and
dispositif):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the costs for advisory services
which a taxable person obtains with a view to establishing the amount of a
claim forming part of his company’s assets and relating to a sale of shares
prior to his becoming liable to VAT do not, in the absence of evidence
establishing that the exclusive reason for those services is to be found in the
economic activity, within the meaning of [the Sixth] Directive, carried out by
the taxable person, have a direct and immediate link with that activity and,
consequently, do not give rise to a right to deduct the VAT charged on them.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In other words, the VAT on inputs which were incurred
in relation to a company’s non-economic activity and which had no link to its

</span>The CJEU returned to the issue of deductibility of VAT in the context of
fund-raising by a taxable person in <i>Securenta Göttinger Immobilienanlagen
und Vermögensmanagement AG v Finanzamt Göttingen </i>(Case C-437/06) [2008] ECR
I-4177; </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2008/C43706.html">[2008] STC 3473</a>. In this case the taxpayer company, Securenta, carried
out both economic and non-economic activities. It acquired capital for its
business by the issue of shares and atypical silent partnerships and sought to
deduct the input tax which it had paid for services relating to its raising of
capital in this way. A dispute about the extent of its entitlement to deduct
resulted in a reference to the CJEU. The relevant question, as reformulated by
the court, was how the right to deduct input tax was to be determined in the
case of a taxpayer who carries out both economic and non-economic activities.
The CJEU observed (para 26) that Securenta carried on three downstream
activities, namely (i) non-economic activities outside the scope of VAT, (ii)
economic activities which were within the scope of the Sixth Directive but were
exempt and (iii) taxed economic activities. The court repeated its ruling (in <i>Abbey
National</i> para 28 and other cited cases) that in order for the input VAT to
give rise to a right to deduct the expenditure incurred on the fund-raising
must be a component of the cost of the output transactions that gave rise to
the right to deduct (para 27). If Securenta’s downstream activities had been
solely economic activities, the supplies of services would have had a direct
and immediate link with those economic activities, but part of Securenta’s
downstream activities were non-economic (para 29). The CJEU therefore held
(para 31 and dispositif 1):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… where a taxpayer simultaneously
carries out economic activities, taxed or exempt, and non-economic activities
outside the scope of the Sixth Directive, deduction of the VAT relating to
expenditure connected with the issue of shares and atypical silent partnerships
is allowed only to the extent that that expenditure is attributable to the
taxpayer’s economic activity within the meaning of article 2(1) of that Directive.”</p>

</span>More recently, the CJEU has called into question its ruling in <i>BLP</i>
in the light of its developing jurisprudence attributing input expenditure on
the raising of capital to the general overheads of an undertaking. In <i>Skatteverket

the parent company which managed an industrial group proposed to sell a
wholly-owned subsidiary and a minority stake in another company, which had
formerly been a wholly-owned subsidiary, to obtain funds to finance other
activities of the group. It proposed to engage professional services in the
sale and sought a ruling from the Swedish Revenue Law Commission on whether it
would be entitled to deduct input VAT paid on those services. The tax authority
challenged the affirmative answer given by the Commission and the Swedish Court
made a reference to the CJEU.</p>

transaction involving a sale of shares in circumstances which were analogous to

VAT paid on services acquired for the purposes of a disposal of shares “if
there is a direct and immediate link between the costs associated with the
input services and the overall economic activities of the taxable person”. It
held that the referring court should take account of all the circumstances

only the cost components of transactions within the scope of the taxable

necessary to achieve neutrality of taxation of all economic activities (paras
55-56);</p>

</span>In principle there needs to be a direct and immediate link between a
particular input transaction and a particular output transaction or
transactions giving rise to an entitlement to deduct before a taxable person is
entitled to deduct input VAT to determine the extent of that entitlement: the
expenditure incurred in acquiring the supplies must be a component of the cost
of the output transactions that gave rise to the right to deduct (para 57);</p>

</span>But, absent that link between an input transaction and specific output
transactions, the taxable person has a right to deduct where the costs of the
services in question are part of his general costs and, as such, components of
the price of the goods or services which he supplies, there thus being a direct
and immediate link between the costs and the person’s economic activity as a
whole (para 58);</p>

</span>On the other hand, where the taxable person acquires goods or services
and uses them for the purposes of transactions that are exempt or do not fall
within the scope of VAT, no output tax can be collected or input tax deducted
(para 59).</p>

</span>The CJEU stated (para 60):</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It follows that whether there is
a right to deduct is determined by the nature of the output transactions to
which the input transactions are assigned. Accordingly, there is a right to
deduct when the input transaction subject to VAT has a direct and immediate
link with one of more output transactions giving rise to the right to deduct.
If that is not the case, it is necessary to examine whether the costs incurred
to acquire the input goods or services are part of the general costs linked to
the taxable person’s overall economic activity. In either case, whether there
is a direct and immediate link is based on the premise that the cost of the
input services is incorporated either in the cost of particular output
transactions or in the cost of goods or services supplied by the taxable person
as part of his economic activities.”</p>

</span>Applying this reasoning to the circumstances of SKF’s proposed
transaction, the CJEU advised that the referring court would have to ascertain
whether the costs incurred were likely to be incorporated in the price of the
shares which SFK intended to sell or whether they were only among the cost
components of SKF’s products (para 62). It referred to the cases which I have
discussed (<i>Midland Bank</i>, <i>Abbey National</i>, <i>Kretztechnik</i> and <i>Securenta</i>),
acknowledging that they concerned financial output transactions which were
outside the scope of VAT. But it went on to observe that the main difference
between an exempt share sale and a share sale which was outside the scope of
VAT was whether the taxable company was or was not involved in the management
of the companies whose shares were being sold. There was therefore a risk of
infringement of the principle of fiscal neutrality through treating objectively
similar transactions differently for tax purposes. It held (para 68) that if
the costs relating to the disposals of shareholdings are considered to form
part of a taxable person’s general costs in cases where the disposal itself is
outside the scope of VAT, the same tax treatment must be allowed where the
disposal is classified as an exempt transaction. In my view it is implicit in
the CJEU’s reasoning that it accepted the distinction which Advocate General
Jacobs made in his opinions in <i>Abbey National </i>and<i> Kretztechnik </i>but
recognised the need to modify the result for the purpose of VAT of an exempt
initial transaction in order to avoid discriminatory fiscal treatment.</a></p><a name="para46">

in a taxable activity. The relevant questions concerned the meaning of article
20 of the Sixth Directive and, in particular, whether during the adjustment
period for which it provided the taxable person could seek to deduct input tax,
when there was no entitlement to deduct at the outset. In <i>Hausgemeinschaft

business asset and made private use of rooms within the building. The business
had deducted as input tax the VAT it had paid on its construction and the
dispute with the German tax authorities was over the mechanism for calculating
the liability to VAT for the private use under articles 6(2)(a) and 11A(1)(c)

</span>In my view, it is clear that in <i>SFK</i> the CJEU has not extended the
reasoning of <i>BLP</i> to apply it to fund-raising transactions which are
outside the scope of VAT. On the contrary, in order to avoid discriminatory
treatment of taxable persons, it has extended the reasoning in the cases about
share disposals that are outside the scope of VAT to share disposals which are
exempt, by requiring an examination as to whether the costs associated with the
input services are incorporated in the price of the shares sold in the initial
transaction or in the prices of the taxable person’s products in downstream
transactions. If the latter, the costs would be “among only the cost components
of transactions within the scope of the taxable person’s economic activities”.</a></p><a name="para49">

consider is also important because it vouches the direct and immediate link
between an input incurred in the context of an initial transaction, which is
not an economic activity, and the taxable person’s general economic activity in
downstream transactions. It also confirms the CJEU’s approach to that link
where there is a significant time lapse between the input transaction and the
downstream activity. In <i>“Sveda” UAB v VMI</i> (Case C-126/14) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C12614.html">EU:C:2015:712</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C12614.html">[2016] STC 447</a>, a Lithuanian company, Sveda, entered into an agreement with the
Lithuanian Ministry of Agriculture in which it undertook to construct a Baltic
mythology recreational and discovery path and to offer it to the public free of
charge. The Ministry undertook to pay 90% of the construction costs and Sveda
was to pay the balance. Sveda undertook to provide the path to the public free
of charge for five years. Sveda sought to deduct as input tax VAT which it paid
on the acquisition or production of capital goods for the construction of the
path. The Lithuanian tax authorities refused to allow the deduction and Sveda
appealed that decision. On appeal the Supreme Administrative Court found that
Sveda intended to carry out economic activities in the future as it would sell
food or souvenirs to visitors to the recreational path. It referred to the CJEU
the question (as re-formulated by the CJEU) whether article 168 of the PVD must
be interpreted as granting a taxable person the right to deduct input VAT paid
for the production or acquisition of capital goods, for the purposes of a planned
economic activity related to rural and recreational tourism, which (i) are
directly intended for use by the public free of charge, and (ii) may be a means
of carrying out taxed transactions.</p>

</span>The CJEU answered the question in the affirmative, “provided that a
direct and immediate link is established between the expenses associated with
the input transactions and an output transaction or transactions giving rise to
the right to deduct or with the taxable person’s economic activity as a whole”
and stated that this was a matter for the referring court to determine on the
basis of objective evidence (para 37 and dispositif). In reaching this
conclusion, the CJEU stated (para 19) that a taxable person may be acting for
the purposes of an economic activity within the meaning of article 9(1) of the
PVD when it acquires goods for the purposes of an economic activity even if the
goods are not used immediately for that economic activity. If the taxable person
is so acting, the right to deduct arises immediately when the goods or services
are delivered (para 20), but their use in an economic activity may occur some
time later. The CJEU continued (para 21):</a></p><a name="para51">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Whether a taxable person acts as
such for the purposes of an economic activity is a question of fact which must
be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case, including the
nature of the asset concerned and the period between the acquisition of the
asset and its use for the purposes of the taxable person’s economic activity
(see inter alia, to that effect, the judgment in <i>Klub OOD</i> <i>v Direktor

</span>The CJEU held that the court has to determine whether there is a direct
and immediate link between the particular input transaction and either (i) a
particular output transaction or transactions, or (ii) the taxable person’s
economic activity as a whole because the expenditure incurred on the input
transaction is part of its general costs and as such is a component of the
price of the goods or services which it supplies in a downstream transaction.
In so doing, the court must consider all the circumstances and take account
only of transactions that are objectively linked to the taxable person’s
economic activity (paras 27-29). See also <i>Finanzamt Köln-Nord v Becker </i>(Case

Lithuanian court that Sveda’s expenditure incurred on the construction of the

CJEU went on to comment on the doubts of the referring court whether there was
a direct link between the input transactions and the planned economic activity
as a whole because the path was intended to be used by the public free of
charge. It stated:</span></p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para53">“32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, the case
law of the court makes it clear that, where goods or services acquired by a
taxable person are used for purposes of transactions that are exempt or do not
fall within the scope of VAT, no output tax can be collected or input tax
deducted (judgment in <i>Eon</i> <i>Aset Menidjmunt OOD v Direktor na Direktsia

and the case law cited). In both cases, the direct and immediate link between
the input expenditure incurred and the economic activities subsequently carried
out by the taxable person is severed.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in no way does it
follow from the order for reference that the making available of the
recreational path to the public is covered by any exemption under the VAT
Directive. Second, given that the expenditure incurred by Sveda in creating
that path can be linked, as is apparent from para 23 of this judgment, to the
economic activity planned by the taxable person, that expenditure does not
relate to activities that are outside the scope of VAT.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, immediate use
of capital goods free of charge does not, in circumstances such as those in the
main proceedings, affect the existence of the direct and immediate link between
input and output transactions or with the taxable person’s economic activities
as a whole and, consequently, that use has no effect on whether a right to
deduct VAT exists.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, there does appear
to be a direct and immediate link between the expenditure incurred by Sveda and
its planned economic activity as a whole, which is, however, a matter for the
referring court to determine.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I observe that in para 32 the CJEU repeated the

In this case the property developer, Iberdrola, which wished to construct 300
apartments in a holiday village, entered into an undertaking with the
municipality to reconstruct a wastewater pump station, which the municipality
owned, to serve both its proposed development and the wider holiday village.
Without that reconstruction, Iberdrola would not have been able to connect its
development to the pump station. A dispute arose with the Bulgarian tax
authorities as to whether Iberdrola could deduct as input tax the VAT which it
incurred on paying a third party construction company for the works on the pump
station.</p>

</span>The CJEU held that a taxable person has the right to deduct input VAT in
respect of a supply of services consisting of the construction or improvement
of a property owned by a third party when that third party enjoys the results
of those services free of charge and when those services are used both by the
taxable person and the third party in the context of their economic activity,
in so far as those services do not exceed that which is necessary to allow that
taxable person to carry out the taxable output transactions and where their
costs are included in the price of those transactions (para 40 and dispositif).
In so holding, the CJEU followed its reasoning in <i>SKF</i> and <i>Sveda</i>
in recognising that there could be a direct and immediate link between an input
and either (i) particular output transactions or (ii) the taxable person’s
economic activity as a whole. This link would exist if the cost of the input
was in the first case a cost component of the particular transactions and in
the second case if it was a cost component of the price of goods and services
which it supplies (paras 27-32).</a></p><a name="para56">

services acquired by a taxable person are used for purposes of transactions
that are exempt or do not fall within the scope of VAT, no output tax can be
collected or input tax deducted. This is because Mr Beal invites the court to
make a reference to the CJEU under article 267 of the TFEU if it disagrees with

</span>I am satisfied that there is no need for a reference in the present
appeal. This is because, as I will seek to show, there are findings of fact that
entitled the FTT to conclude that FASL when it acquired the SPFEs was acting as

business through capital expenditure on assets which it would use to generate
taxable output transactions.</a></p><a name="para59">

</span>The statements in para 59 of <i>SKF</i> and para 32 of <i>Sveda</i> are
wholly consistent with the principle of the neutrality of VAT enshrined in
article 2(2) of the PVD. Thus in <i>Investrand</i>, which I discussed in para
39 above, the expenditure on the arbitration related to a financial claim
arising out of a transaction carried out while Investrand was not a taxable
person and the fact that the costs relating to the arbitration were incurred
after it had become a taxable person was irrelevant because the expenditure had
no connection with Investrand’s activities as a taxable person. Similarly, on
the facts in <i>Uudenkaupungin kaupunki</i> (para 48 above), absent the
arrangements under article 20 of the Sixth Directive, the intention to use and
initial use of the building for a non-taxable activity would have prevented the
recovery as input tax of VAT incurred on its construction notwithstanding the
later decision to use it for a taxable activity because when the costs were
incurred they were not incurred by a taxable person acting as such. Similarly,
in <i>Wellcome Trust Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>(Case C-155/94) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C15594.html">[1996] ECR I-3013</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C15594.html">[1996] STC 945</a>, it was because the purchase and sale of shares by a
charitable trust was not an economic activity that the VAT paid on the fees for
professional services relating to those transactions were not recoverable;
there was no downstream economic activity to which the costs could be linked.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since the hearing in this appeal and the preparation of this judgment in
draft, the Eighth Chamber of the CJEU has issued its judgment on the Court of
Appeal’s reference in the <i>University of Cambridge</i> case on 3 July 2019
(Case C-316/18) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2019/C31618.html">EU:C:2019:559</a>. As the CJEU records (para 9) the university is a
not-for-profit educational institution whose principal activity is the
provision of educational services, which are VAT exempt, but which also makes
taxable supplies including commercial research, the sale of publications, etc.
The university’s activities are financed in part by charitable donations and
endowments, which it places in a fund and invests. The university has claimed a
right to deduct input VAT relating to fees which it has paid to third party
managers of the fund on the basis that the income generated by the fund has
been used to finance the whole range of its activities.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU (para 19) interpreted the questions of the Court of Appeal in
the reference as asking, in essence:</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“whether article 168(a) of the VAT
Directive must be interpreted as meaning that a taxable person that (i) is
carrying out both taxable and exempt activities, (ii) invests the donations and
endowments that it receives by placing them in a fund, and (iii) uses the
income generated by that fund to cover the costs of all of those activities is
entitled to deduct, as an overhead, input VAT paid in respect of the costs
associated with that investment.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU answered that question in the negative. Its reasoning is as
follows. First, the collection of donations and endowments is not an economic
activity and is outside the scope of the PVD. VAT paid in respect of costs
incurred in connection with such collection is not deductible, regardless of
the reason for the receipt (para 29). Secondly, the activity of collection and
the activity of the investment of the collected funds are treated for VAT
purposes as one non-economic activity as the investment is merely a direct
continuation of the non-economic activity of collection. Accordingly, input VAT
paid in respect of costs associated with the investment is also non-deductible
(para 30). Thirdly, and in my view critically, the CJEU distinguished the case
on its facts from the line of authority which I have discussed and of which <i>Kretztechnik
</i>is a part. It stated (para 31):</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is true that the fact that
costs are incurred in the acquisition of a service in the context of a
non-economic activity does not, in itself, preclude those costs giving rise to
a right to deduct in the context of the taxable person’s economic activity, if
they are incorporated into the price of particular output transactions or into
the price of goods and services provided by the taxable person in the context
of that economic activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 May 2005, <i>Kretztechnik</i>,
C-465/03, EU:C:2005:320, para 36).”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">But, referring to the documents before the court, it
concluded that the costs of management of the funds were not incorporated into
the price of a particular output transaction. It also concluded, by reference
to those documents, that the costs were incurred to generate resources to
finance all of the university’s output transactions, thereby allowing the price
of its goods and services to be reduced. The costs therefore were not
components of the price of goods and services provided by the university and
could not form part of its overheads. The VAT therefore was not deductible
(para 32).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the ruling that the income was used to reduce all of the
costs of the university’s goods and services prevented the fund managers’ fees
from being a component of the costs of those goods and services and thus part
of the university’s overheads, which is the second alternative in <i>Kretztechnik</i>.
The <i>University of Cambridge</i> judgment, which the CJEU has delivered
without requiring an opinion from an Advocate General, is therefore an
application of established CJEU jurisprudence which I have discussed above and
summarise below.</a></p><a name="para64">

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Alternatively, there must be a
direct and immediate link between those acquired goods and services and the
whole of the taxable person’s economic activity because their cost forms part
of that business’s overheads and thus a component part of the price of its
products: see for example <i>BLP</i>, para 25; <i>Midland Bank</i>, para 31; <i>Abbey

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Where the taxable person acquires
professional services for an initial fund-raising transaction which is outside
the scope of VAT, that use of the services does not prevent it from deducting
the VAT payable on those services as input tax and retaining that deduction if
its purpose in fund-raising, objectively ascertained, was to fund its economic
activity and it later uses the funds raised to develop its business of
providing taxable supplies. See, for example, <i>Abbey National</i>, paras
34-36; <i>Kretztechnik</i>, paras 36-38; <i>Securenta</i>, paras 27-29 and <i>SKF</i>,
para 64. The same may apply if an analogous transaction involving the sale of
shares is classified as an exempt transaction: <i>SKF</i>, para 68.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Where the cost of the acquired
services, including services relating to fund-raising, are a cost component of
downstream activities of the taxable person which are either exempt
transactions or transactions outside the scope of VAT, the VAT paid on such
services is not deductible as input tax. See for example <i>Securenta</i>, paras
29 and 31; <i>SKF</i>,<i> </i>paras 58-60 and <i>Sveda</i>, para 32. Where the
taxable person carries on taxable transactions, exempt transactions and
transactions outside the scope of VAT, the VAT paid on the services it has
acquired has to be apportioned under article 173 of the PVD.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The right to deduct VAT as input
tax arises immediately when the deductible tax becomes chargeable: article 167
of the PVD, <i>Securenta</i>, paras 24 and 30 and <i>SKF</i>, para 55. As a
result, there may be a time lapse between the deduction of the input tax and
the use of the acquired goods or services in an output transaction, as occurred
in <i>Sveda</i>. Further, if the taxable person acquired the goods and services
for its economic activity but, as a result of circumstances beyond its control,
it is unable to use them in the context of taxable transactions, the taxable
person retains its entitlement to deduct: <i>Midland Bank</i>, paras 22 and 23.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The purpose of the taxable person
in carrying out the fund-raising is a question of fact which the court
determines by having regard to objective evidence. The CJEU states that the
existence of a link between the fund-raising transaction and the person’s
taxable activity is to be assessed in the light of the objective content of the
transaction: <i>Sveda</i>, para 29; <i>Iberdrola</i>, para 31. The ultimate
question is whether the taxable person is acting as such for the purposes of an
economic activity. This is a question of fact which must be assessed in the
light of all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the asset
concerned and the period between its acquisition and its use for the purposes
of the taxable person’s economic activity: <i>Eon Aset Menidjmunt</i> <i>OOD v

</span>I have set out the factual background in paras 2-7 above. There was
objective evidence that FASL when carrying out its fund-raising activity was
carrying out a taxable business and was contemplating using the funds raised on
three principal developments - a windfarm, the construction of further farm
buildings and the acquisition of neighbouring farmland.</a></p><a name="para66">

</span>I do not detect in the jurisprudence of the CJEU any basis for
distinguishing expenditure incurred in a fund-raising exercise which takes the
form of a sale of shares from a fund-raising exercise that involves the receipt
of a subsidy over several years. The fact that the subsidies were included in
FASL’s profit and loss account and counted as the business’s income for income
tax purposes is not a basis for distinguishing the share sale cases such as <i>Kretztechnik
</i>and <i>Securenta</i>. I do not view the annual payment of the subsidies
under the SFP scheme as a separate transaction from the acquisition of the
entitlement to those subsidies which is capable of breaking the link between
the purchase of the SFPE units and the deployment of the net proceeds of the
subsidies in FASL’s subsequent economic activities. In any event the FTT was
not bound to hold that the acquisition of the SFPE units and the receipt of the
subsidies were separate transactions. On the FTT’s findings of fact, the
purchase of the SFPE units was part of an exercise raising funds for FASL’s
economic activities. The underlying principle is the principle of neutrality
which relieves the taxable person of the burden of VAT payable and paid in the
course of all its economic activities: <i>Rompelman</i>, para 19; <i>Belgian
State v Ghent Coal Terminal NV</i>, para 15; <i>Gabalfrisa SL v Agencia Estatal

</span></a></span><a name="para68"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">While it is not clear from the
FTT’s findings when any of FASL’s projects will come to fruition, I am
persuaded that the FTT was entitled to conclude that FASL when it incurred the
costs of the purchase of the SFPE units was acting as a taxable person because
it was acquiring assets in support of its current and planned economic
activities, namely farming and the windfarm. On that basis FASL was entitled to
an immediate right of deduction of the VAT paid on the purchase of the SFPE
units and is entitled to retain that deduction or repayment so long as it uses
the SFPs which it received as cost components of its economic activities. A
start-up business can acquire goods and services to support its future taxable
supplies and claim VAT paid on those acquisitions as input tax; so too in
principle can an existing business which proposes to expand its economic
activity. On the facts found, FASL does not carry out and does not propose to
carry out downstream non-economic activities or exempt transactions. Therefore,
no question of apportionment under article 173 of the PVD arises.</span></a></p><a name="para68">

<p class="ParaHeading">The task for HMRC</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I recognise that a claim for
deduction which depends on the future behaviour of the taxable person, such as
the claim in this case, may create practical difficulties for HMRC in
administering the VAT system fairly and, in particular, in avoiding unwarranted
repayments of VAT. But it is an established part of the VAT system that a
taxable person is entitled to an immediate deduction of the VAT which it has
paid (para 60(vi) above). It is also well-established that a taxable person can
claim to deduct as input tax VAT which it has paid on the acquisition of goods
or services although it will not use those goods and services as components of
taxable transactions immediately: <i>Rompelman</i>, para 22; <i>Lennartz</i> <i>v
Finanzamt München III</i> (Case C-97/90) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1991/C9790.html">[1991] ECR I-3795</a>, paras 13-16 and <i>Sveda</i>,
para 20.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The recognition that fund-raising costs may, where the evidence permits,
be treated as general overheads of a taxable person’s business means that the
taxable person must be able to provide objective evidence to support the
connection between the fund-raising transaction and its proposed economic
activities. The taxpayer also needs to maintain adequate banking arrangements
and records to vouch the later use of the funds so raised to demonstrate its
entitlement to deduct and to retain the deduction, if investigated. As the CJEU
recorded in <i>Sveda </i>(para 36) the taxpayer will have to repay input VAT if
it does not use the input goods or services for the purposes of its economic
activity. HMRC has power to charge VAT under regulation 3 of the Value Added
Tax (Supply of Services) Order 1993 (SI 1993/1507), where a taxable person uses
services supplied to it for its business for a purpose other than a business
use, by treating that use as a supply of services in the course of its
business. This may involve HMRC in more investigations than the CJEU envisaged
in <i>BLP </i>(para 24). But this supervision of the subsequent use of the
raised funds, with which the services were associated, seems to me to be an
inevitable consequence of the CJEU’s interpretation of the PVD.</a></p><a name="para70">
