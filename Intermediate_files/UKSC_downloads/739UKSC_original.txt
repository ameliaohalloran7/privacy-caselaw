She was charged with her mother’s murder but, in view of the psychiatric evidence, the prosecution agreed to a plea of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. That plea was accepted by the court and on 8 July 2011 Foskett J sentenced the appellant to a hospital order under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”) and an unlimited restriction order under section 41 of the 1983 Act.

She has been diagnosed at different times as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. She began experiencing problems with her mental health in 1995. From about 2003, she had various admissions to hospital, including formal admissions under the 1983 Act. Between April 2006 and June 2008, she was detained in hospital under section 3 of the 1983 Act. She was then granted leave from hospital pursuant to section 17 of the 1983 Act to enable her to live in the community. She was subsequently discharged from detention and placed on a Community Treatment Order (“CTO”) made under section 17A of the 1983 Act (as inserted by section 32(2) of the Mental Health Act 2007) on 14 January 2009. Her care plan stated that there should be a low threshold for recall to hospital pursuant to section 17E(1) of the 1983 Act.</a></p><a name="para6">

She missed various appointments and, on 23 August 2010, when visited by a housing support worker, Ms Loynes, she appeared agitated and either would not make eye contact or would stare intensely. Concerns were expressed to SCMHT who decided to wait until 25 August 2010 to carry out an assessment, when the appellant’s previous care co-ordinator would be available.</a></p><a name="para8">

She knocked on the door demanding to be let in and then went down the garden to make a phone call to Ms Loynes to express her concern about the appellant’s mental health and to ask if she could be let into the flat.

She was seen by several people, covered in blood and carrying the knife. She was described by witnesses as walking in an odd way with a detached crazy look.

He went on to say that she was nevertheless suffering from a profound abnormality of mental functioning at the time of the killing which at the material time substantially impaired her responsibility for the commission of the act and impaired her ability to form a rational judgement and exercise self-control, and so the defence of diminished responsibility was available to her.</a></p><a name="para14">

His sentencing remarks, in what he described as “a desperately sad and tragic case”, included the following:</a></p><a name="para16"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There has … been a full review of the care being given to you at the time, and it is, I think, inappropriate for me to make any comment one way or the other about that, save to say that it is plain that lessons have been learned from it, as I understand, having read the report.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The one thing that is clear, from the report, is a conclusion that there was little, if any, basis for believing that your mother would be a potential victim of any violence that you might display in a psychotic episode, and that conclusion and analysis seems to have been borne out by the two expert opinions that I have read in the context of this case.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">When you recovered from that psychotic episode, as you did, you appreciated fully what you had done, and you were distressed beyond measure.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The very detailed and comprehensive reports I have seen from Dr Bradley and Dr Lord, to whom I express my appreciation, demonstrate clearly that your ability to act rationally and with self-control at the time of the incident was substantially and profoundly impaired, because of the psychotic episode to which I have referred, and to the extent that you had little, if any, true control over what you did.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">That means that the conviction for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility is obviously the appropriate verdict, and the prosecution has undoubtedly correctly accepted that is so.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">It is also that mental health background that informs and largely dictates how this case should be disposed of. It is quite plain that in your own interests, and in the interests of the public, if and when you are released, that the most important consideration is the successful treatment and/or management of your condition.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">I should say that there is no suggestion in your case that you should be seen as bearing a significant degree of responsibility for what you did. Had there been any such suggestion I would have given serious consideration to making an order under section 45(A) of the Mental Health Act 1983, however, on the material and evidence before me that issue does not arise.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The joint recommendation of Dr Bradley and Dr Lord is that you should be made the subject of a hospital order under section 37 of the Act, with an unlimited restriction order under section 41 of the Act.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Dr Bradley says in her report that your illness is difficult to treat and monitor and that ‘A high degree of vigilance and scrutiny of mental state will be needed to ensure successful rehabilitation’.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Dr Lord says in his report that the effect of such an order would be that you would be ‘detained in secure psychiatric services for a substantial period of time in order for such treatment and rehabilitation to be completed and to ensure the safety of the public’. The restrictions imposed by section 41, he says in his report and has repeated in what he has said to me, would be ‘invaluable in protecting the public from the risk of serious harm in the future’.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Given those strong and firm recommendations from two experienced psychiatrists, who examined you and your psychiatric history with very considerable care, it seems to me that this is the order that I should make, and I will make.”</p>

Whilst suffering from that disorder he killed a man. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and he was ordered to be detained in a hospital under sections 37 and 41 of the 1983 Act. The claimant brought an action in negligence against the defendants, a train operator and the company responsible for the rail infrastructure. The defendants admitted negligence but claimed that public policy precluded the recovery of losses incurred after the date of the manslaughter by reason of the ex turpi causa doctrine. The claim for damages included damages which were the result of the sentence imposed on him, such as general damages for his detention and loss of earnings during it (“the narrow claim”). It also included damages which were the result of the killing, such as general damages for feelings of guilt and remorse consequent upon the killing and an indemnity against any claims which might be brought by dependants of the deceased (“the wide claim”). The House of Lords held that both the narrow and the wide claims were precluded by the operation of the ex turpi causa doctrine.</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Their principal argument invokes a special rule of public policy. In its wider form, it is that you cannot recover compensation for loss which you have suffered in consequence of your own criminal act. In its narrower and more specific form, it is that you cannot recover for damage which flows from loss of liberty, a fine or other punishment lawfully imposed upon you in consequence of your own unlawful act. In such a case it is the law which, as a matter of penal policy, causes the damage and it would be inconsistent for the law to require you to be compensated for that damage.”</p>

He held that it was well established by authority in this country and in the Commonwealth. He said that the rule was based on inconsistency. As he explained at para 37:</a></p><a name="para39"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The inconsistency is between the criminal law, which authorizes the damage suffered by the plaintiff in the form of loss of liberty because of his own personal responsibility for the crimes he committed, and the claim that the civil law should require someone else to compensate him for that loss of liberty.”</p>

As he stated at para 41:</a></p><a name="para40"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it has been submitted in this case that the sentence of detention in a hospital reflected the fact that Mr Gray was not really being punished but detained for his own good to enable him to be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. But the sentence imposed by the court for a criminal offence is usually for a variety of purposes: punishment, treatment, reform, deterrence, protection of the public against the possibility of further offences. It would be impossible to make distinctions on the basis of what appeared to be its predominant purpose. In my view it must be assumed that the sentence (in this case, the restriction order) was what the criminal court regarded as appropriate to reflect the personal responsibility of the accused for the crime he had committed. As one commentator has said ‘Tort law has enough on its plate without having to play the criminal law’s conscience’: see <i>EK Banakas</i> [1985] CLJ 195, 197. …”</p>

As he stated at para 50:</a></p><a name="para41"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Mr Gray’s claims for loss of earnings after his arrest and for general damages for his detention, conviction and damage to reputation are all claims for damage caused by the lawful sentence imposed upon him for manslaughter and therefore fall within the narrower version of the rule which I would invite your Lordships to affirm.”</p>

In that case the claimant stabbed a man to death after he had been discharged from hospital where he had been detained for treatment for a mental disorder. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and he was ordered to be detained in a hospital under sections 37 and 41 of the 1983 Act. He sued the local authority for damages for loss of liberty as a result of its negligence in discharging him and failing to provide adequate after care. Although the claim fell within the narrower rule, the reasoning of the court in dismissing the claim was based on the wider rule, as made clear by Beldam LJ at pp 989-990:</a></p><a name="para42"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the present case the plaintiff has been convicted of a serious criminal offence. In such a case public policy would in our judgment preclude the court from entertaining the plaintiff’s claim unless it could be said that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or that what he was doing was wrong. The offence of murder was reduced to one of manslaughter by reason of the plaintiff’s mental disorder but his mental state did not justify a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Consequently, though his responsibility for killing Mr Zito is diminished, he must be taken to have known what he was doing and that it was wrong. A plea of diminished responsibility accepts that the accused’s mental responsibility is substantially impaired but it does not remove liability for his criminal act … The court ought not to allow itself to be made an instrument to enforce obligations alleged to arise out of the plaintiff’s own criminal act and we would therefore allow the appeal on this ground.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it is offensive to public notions of the fair distribution of resources that a claimant should be compensated (usually out of public funds) for the consequences of his own criminal conduct.”</p>

Such negligence was to be regarded as merely providing the occasion for the claimant’s conduct. In conclusion he stated as follows at para 55:</a></p><a name="para44"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“However the test is expressed, the wider rule seems to me to cover the remaining heads of damage in this case. Mr Gray’s liability to compensate the dependants of the dead pedestrian was an immediate ‘inextricable’ consequence of his having intentionally killed him. The same is true of his feelings of guilt and remorse.”</p>

That case concerned a claim for wage loss during time spent in prison as a result of various offences which were alleged to have been committed as a consequence of sexual assaults by a prison officer during an earlier period of incarceration. At para 68 Lord Rodger cited with approval from the unanimous judgment of the court delivered by Rothstein J:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zastowny’s wage loss while incarcerated is occasioned by the illegal acts for which he was convicted and sentenced to serve time. In my view, therefore, the ex turpi doctrine bars Zastowny from recovering damages for time spent in prison because such an award would introduce an inconsistency in the fabric of law. This is because such an award would be, as McLachlin J described in <i>Hall v Hebert</i> <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1fs4g">[1993] 2 SCR 159</a>, 178, ‘giving with one hand what it takes away with the other’. When a person receives a criminal sanction, he or she is subject to a criminal penalty as well as the civil consequences that are the natural result of the criminal sanction. The consequences of imprisonment include wage loss. …</p> 
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserving the integrity of the justice system by preventing inconsistency in the law is a matter of judicial policy that underlies the ex turpi doctrine.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p> 
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … In asking for damages for wage loss for time spent in prison, Zastowny is asking to be indemnified for the consequences of the commission of illegal acts for which he was found criminally responsible. Zastowny was punished for his illegal acts on the basis that he possessed sufficient mens rea to be held criminally responsible for them. He is personally responsible for his criminal acts and the consequences that flow from them. He cannot attribute them to others and evade or seek rebate of those consequences …”</p>

In other words, in the circumstances of that case the application of the ex turpi causa doctrine helped to promote the more fundamental legal policy of preventing inconsistency in the law. That such a policy exists is beyond question. In Zastowny and the preceding cases, the need was to ensure that the civil and criminal courts were consistent in their handling of the plaintiff’s criminal conduct and its consequences. But that is simply one manifestation of a desirable attribute of any developed legal system. … Likewise, in the present case, when considering the claim for loss of earnings, a civil court should bear in mind that it is desirable for the criminal and civil courts to be consistent in the way that they regard what the claimant did. As Samuels JA observed in <i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold</i> 25 NSWLR 500, 514, failure to do so would generate the sort of clash between civil and criminal law that is apt to bring the law into disrepute.”</p>

As he stated at para 78:</a></p><a name="para47"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The civil courts must therefore proceed on the basis that, even though the claimant’s responsibility for killing Mr Boultwood was diminished by his PTSD, he nevertheless knew what he was doing when he killed him and he was responsible for what he did. Similarly, it must be assumed that the disposals adopted by the criminal courts were appropriate in all the circumstances, including the circumstance that he was suffering from PTSD. Rafferty J imposed a hospital order and a restriction order. While it is correct to say that a hospital order, even with a restriction, is not regarded as a punishment, this does not mean that the judge was treating the claimant as not being to blame for what he did.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By imposing the hospital order with a restriction, the judge was ensuring that, because he had committed manslaughter, the claimant would not be free to move around in the community unless and until authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. … In my view, it would be inconsistent with the policy underlying the making of the orders for a civil court now to award the claimant damages for loss of earnings relating to the period when he was subject to them.</p>

He cannot attribute them to others or seek rebate of those consequences. Yet that is precisely what the claimant is trying to do, both in his claim for any sum he is found liable to pay in damages to Mr Boultwood’s dependants and in his claim for his feelings of guilt and remorse.</p>

His main reason for rejecting the claim was that the damages were too remote. But he would also have rejected it, at pp 950<span style="background:white">h</span>-951<span style="background:white">f</span>, on the public policy ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to be indemnified for the damages which he was liable to pay as a result of his criminal attacks.

He said, however, that whilst Lord Hoffmann’s comments at para 37 were correct in relation to the sentence imposed in Mr Gray’s case, they would not always be true of a hospital order imposed under section 37 of the 1983 Act. He referred to the explanation of such orders given by Mustill LJ in <i>R v Birch </i>at p 210, as summarised above. Lord Phillips then drew attention to the fact that under section 45A of the 1983 Act it was now possible to combine a hospital order with a penal sentence.</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comments of both Mustill LJ and Lord Bingham recognised that a mentally disordered offender whose mental condition did not satisfy the test of insanity or render him unfit to plead might none the less have no significant responsibility for his offence. Furthermore, while a conviction for an offence punishable with imprisonment is necessary to confer jurisdiction on a judge to impose a hospital order under section 37, the offence leading to that conviction may have no relevance to the decision to make the hospital order. Thus in <i>R v Eaton</i> [1976] Crim LR 390 a hospital order with a restriction order unlimited as to time was made in respect of a woman with a psychopathic disorder where her offence was minor criminal damage.</p> 
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such an extreme case, where the sentencing judge makes it clear that the defendant’s offending behaviour has played no part in the decision to impose the hospital order, it is strongly arguable that the hospital order should be treated as being a consequence of the defendant’s mental condition and not of the defendant’s criminal act. In that event the public policy defence of ex turpi causa would not apply. More difficult is the situation where it is the criminal act of the defendant that demonstrates the need to detain the defendant both for his own treatment and for the protection of the public, but the judge makes it clear that he does not consider that the defendant should bear significant personal responsibility for his crime. I would reserve judgment as to whether ex turpi causa applies in either of these situations, for we did not hear full argument in relation to them.

Then it might be argued that the defendants should be liable for any loss of earnings during the claimant’s detention under the section 37 order, just as they should be liable for any loss of earnings during his detention under a section 3 order necessitated by a condition brought about by their negligence. That point does not arise on the facts of this case, however, and it was not fully explored at the hearing.

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the narrow claim and the wide claim failed on the grounds of public policy.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Hoffmann did not consider that this applied to the wide claim but held that a related policy did, namely that “it is offensive to public notions of the fair distribution of resources that a claimant should be compensated (usually out of public funds) for the consequences of his own criminal conduct.” I understand this to mean that allowing a claimant to be compensated for the consequences of his own criminal conduct risks bringing the law into disrepute and diminishing respect for it. It is an outcome of which public opinion would be likely to disapprove and would thereby undermine public confidence in the law - “the public confidence principle”.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The public confidence principle is also applicable to the narrow claim. It is related to the consistency principle since one of the reasons that the public would be likely to disapprove of the outcome is the inconsistency which it involves between the criminal law and the civil law.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Lord Rodger appeared to consider that the consistency principle did not apply to the wide claim, the policy reasons he gives for rejecting the claim reflect that principle. The reason that a person cannot “attribute … to others” acts for which he has been found criminally responsible, or “seek rebate” of the consequences of those acts, is that it would be inconsistent with that finding of criminal responsibility. If a person has been found criminally responsible for certain acts it would be inconsistent for the civil courts to absolve that person of such responsibility and to attribute responsibility for those same acts to someone else.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(6)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whilst the consistency principle more obviously applies to the narrow claim, on analysis it applies to the wide claim as well. In relation to the narrow claim the inconsistency is with both the criminal court’s finding of responsibility and the sentence it has imposed. In relation to the wide claim it is with the former only.</p>

The agreement between them was a conspiracy to commit an offence of insider dealing contrary to section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993. The issue was whether the illegality of the agreement meant that Mr Patel’s claim for restitution for unjust enrichment, based on the total failure of consideration under that unlawful agreement, should fail.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“…whether allowing recovery for something which was illegal would produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law, and so cause damage to the integrity of the legal system.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“107.&nbsp; In considering whether it would be disproportionate to refuse relief to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy, various factors may be relevant.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“120.&nbsp; The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system (or, possibly, certain aspects of public morality, the boundaries of which have never been made entirely clear and which do not arise for consideration in this case). In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary (a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, (b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and (c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever rationale one adopts for the illegality principle, it is manifestly designed to vindicate the public interest as against the interests and legal rights of the parties. That is why the judge is required to take the point of his own motion even if the parties have not raised it, as the deputy judge did in this case. The operation of the principle cannot therefore depend on an evaluation of the equities as between the parties or the proportionality of its impact upon the claimant.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‘range of factors’ test largely devalues the principle of consistency, by relegating it to the status of one of a number of evaluative factors, entitled to no more weight than the judge chooses to give it in the particular case. …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … If the application of the illegality principle is to depend on the court’s view of how illegal the illegality was or how much it matters, there would appear to be no principle whatever to guide the evaluation other than the judge’s gut instinct.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‘range of factors’ test discards any requirement for an analytical connection between the illegality and the claim, by making the nature of the connection simply one factor in a broader evaluation of individual cases and offering no guidance as to what sort of connection might be relevant. …”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statutory illegality applies where a legislative provision either (a) prohibits the making of a contract so that it is unenforceable by either party or (b) provides that it, or some particular term, is unenforceable by one or other party. The underlying principle is straightforward: if the legislation itself has provided that the contract is unenforceable, in full or in the relevant respect, the court is bound to respect that provision. That being the rationale, the knowledge or culpability of the party who is prevented from recovering is irrelevant: it is a simple matter of obeying the statute.</p>

The cases it discusses include tort cases, such as <i>Gray</i> and <i>Hounga v Allen</i>, as well as a number of Commonwealth tort law authorities. The case of <i>Hall v Hebert</i>, on which particular reliance was placed, was a tort case. <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>, which was not followed, concerned trusts and property rights. At para 99, Lord Toulson identifies the policy reasons for the doctrine of illegality “as a defence to a civil claim”. The approach set out in paras 101 and 120 is expressed in general and unqualified terms.</a></p><a name="para76">

That would be to disregard the value of precedent built up in various areas of the law to address particular factual situations giving rise to the illegality defence. Those decisions remain of precedential value unless it can be shown that they are not compatible with the approach set out in <i>Patel</i> in the sense that they cannot stand with the reasoning in <i>Patel</i> or were wrongly decided in the light of that reasoning. Lord Toulson made it clear in <i>Patel</i> that the principles he identified were to be found in the existing case law - see, for example, paras 42, 99 and 102-106.</a></p><a name="para77">

In employment law the touchstone for the availability of the defence of common law illegality to employee claims has long been recognised as being whether the employee has knowingly participated in the illegal performance of the contract, as stated in the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/170.html">[2001] 1 WLR 225</a>, paras 31-32 per Peter Gibson LJ. In <i>Okedina v Chikale</i> that approach had been followed by the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal. It was submitted on appeal that this was inadequate and that the matter should have been addressed by going through the <i>Patel</i> trio of considerations. The Court of Appeal rejected the submission that it was “necessary for the tribunal on the facts of this case to carry out an elaborate analysis by reference to the particular factors enumerated”.

His judgment does not require a reconsideration of how the rule has been applied in the previous case law except where such an application is inconsistent with those principles. In the case of a contract of employment which has been illegally performed, there is nothing in <i>Patel v Mirza</i> inconsistent with the well-established approach in <i>Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/170.html">[2001] ICR 99</a> as regards [common law illegality] cases.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“74.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to see that those passages can provide any support for Ms Henderson’s appeal. Lord Phillips’ speculation on the factual scenario postulated in para 15 was not only <i>obiter</i> but was expressly made on the footing that it had not been explored at the hearing, and he reserved his position on it. For his part, Lord Rodger did not address at all the scenario postulated by Lord Phillips in para 15. Lord Rodger’s speculation was, moreover, limited to a case where the index offence of which a claimant was convicted was trivial - a case which, he accepted, had not been explored at the hearing and on which he reserved his opinion.</p> 
 <p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, a majority of the appellate committee (Lords Hoffmann, Rodger and Scott) did not agree with the observations of Lord Phillips at para 15 of his speech, at the very least in so far as those observations were intended to apply to a serious crime such as manslaughter.”</p>

As already explained, both Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger considered the policy reasons for the rules and concluded that they were justified as a matter of public policy. Even though Lord Hoffmann endorsed a causation approach to the application of the wider rule, that involved a causal rule based on policy considerations.

The defence dates from 1843 and has often been criticised as being out of date and failing to reflect modern medical understanding and practice. As the Law Commission stated at para 1.2 of its July 2013 Discussion Paper, “Criminal Liability: Insanity and Automatism”: “The existing law has long been the subject of academic criticism for being unfair, out of date and failing to reflect advances made in medicine, psychology and psychiatry”. The appellant places particular emphasis on the Law Commission’s conclusion that lack of responsibility should be extended not only to those who are unable to think rationally, but also to those who are unable to control their actions. As stated in the Law Commission’s principal conclusions:</a></p><a name="para99"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our principal conclusion is that people should not be held criminally responsible for their conduct if they lack the capacity to conform their behaviour to meet the demands imposed by the criminal law regulating that conduct. This lack of capacity might consist in an inability to think rationally, or in an inability to control one’s actions. The reason for that lack of capacity might lie in a mental disorder, or in a physical disorder.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99"></a><a name="para100">100. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given what the appellant says is the unsatisfactory state of the law governing criminal responsibility, it is submitted that no incoherence would be introduced into the law if tort law was to adopt a different approach to responsibility. It is pointed out that in any event civil law approaches issues of responsibility differently, focusing more on the question of capacity. Moreover, the purposes of the criminal law (focusing on the person’s wrongdoing) and tort law (the connection between the wrongdoing and the claimant’s injury) are different. Given the divergent functions of tort law and the criminal law, it is submitted that there is nothing incoherent or inconsistent about tort law and criminal law having different tests for responsibility.</a></p><a name="para100"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para100"></a><a name="para101">101. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That there is no inconsistency is said to be further borne out in this case by the fact that the sentence imposed on the appellant involved no penal element. A sentence under the 1983 Act only contains a penal element if an order under section 45A is made - see, for example, <i>R v Edwards</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2018/595.html">[2018] 4 WLR 64</a>, paras 12 and 34. To decide whether a penal element to the sentence is necessary, the judge should assess the offender’s degree of responsibility together with the harm caused by the offence. In this case, the judge declined to make such an order precisely because of the appellant’s lack of significant personal responsibility.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para102">102. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In such circumstances, it is submitted that the denial of the tort claim by means of illegality would constitute a punishment meted out in the civil law when the criminal law had declined to punish. If anything, the need for coherence would best be served by tort law declining to do what the criminal law has refused to do.</a></p><a name="para102">

If, however, a test is required then it should be: “did the claimant lack capacity to conform his/her behaviour to the demands imposed by the criminal law?”.</a></p><a name="para103">

I am, however, unable to accept that they meet the high hurdle of justifying departure from the House of Lords’ relatively recent decision in <i>Gray</i>.</a></p><a name="para104"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para104"></a><a name="para105">105. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained above, the key consideration as far as the majority in <i>Gray</i> were concerned was that the claimant had been found to be criminally responsible for his acts. That he had been convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility meant that responsibility for his criminal acts was diminished, but it was not removed. It was not an insanity case and so, as Beldam LJ pointed out in <i>Clunis</i> (at p 989): “he must be taken to have known what he was doing and that it was wrong”.</a></p><a name="para105"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para105"></a><a name="para106">106. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In such circumstances, the majority in <i>Gray</i> justifiably considered that inconsistency would arise not only if he was allowed to recover damages resulting from the sentence imposed, but also if they resulted from the intentional criminal act for which he had been held responsible. To allow recovery would be to attribute responsibility for that criminal act not, as determined by the criminal law, to the criminal but to someone else, namely the tortious defendant. There is a contradiction between the law’s treatment of conduct as criminal and the acceptance that such conduct should give rise to a civil right of reimbursement. The criminal under the criminal law becomes the victim under tort law.</a></p><a name="para106"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para106"></a><a name="para107">107. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whilst the wider rule may not involve, as the application of the narrower rule does, the law giving with one hand what it takes away with the other, it does involve, as Lord Hughes said in <i>Hounga v Allen</i> at para 55, the law condoning “when facing right what it condemns when facing left”.</a></p><a name="para107"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para107"></a><a name="para108">108. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, as the appellant submits, the degree of personal responsibility is a matter for the trial judge to determine in the civil claim there is a clear risk of inconsistent decisions being reached in the criminal and the civil courts, both as to the degree of responsibility involved and as to how that is to be determined. If, as is further submitted, it is appropriate for the civil court to move away from the <i>M’Naghten</i> approach to insanity, and to develop its own approach to such issues, then the inconsistencies will be heightened.</a></p><a name="para108"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para108"></a><a name="para109">109. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does the fact that there may be no penal element to the sentence imposed by the criminal court alter matters. As Lord Rodger observed at para 78 of <i>Gray</i>, even if the sentence is not regarded as being a punishment, “this does not mean that the judge was treating the claimant as not being to blame for what he did”. A conviction for manslaughter by diminished responsibility still involves blame. The defendant would otherwise have been convicted of murder and some responsibility for the unlawful killing necessarily remains. Moreover, the fact of a criminal conviction for manslaughter is itself punitive.</a></p><a name="para109"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para109"></a><a name="para110">110. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further difficulty with the appellant’s argument is why significant personal responsibility is to be regarded as the threshold, precisely what that means and how it is to be determined. Whilst a sentencing judge will be concerned with the level of responsibility involved, he or she will not be specifically addressing the issue of significant personal responsibility. If, for example, in accordance with the Guideline an offender is found to bear medium responsibility, how does that relate to the threshold of significant personal responsibility? In any event, any findings which may be made by the trial judge in the criminal proceedings will be solely for the purpose of sentencing.</a></p><a name="para110"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110"></a><a name="para111">111. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not sufficient simply to say that this will be a matter of fact for the trial judge to determine in the civil claim. As the Law Commission’s Discussion Paper illustrates, the issue of responsibility raises questions of great complexity and difficulty. This fundamental building block of the appellant’s case was barely addressed in the appellant’s written case or in the 77-page speaking “note” provided on the first day of the hearing, a clear abuse of the written case procedure and its required page limits. Instead, the court was provided with a five-page insert to the speaking note which put forward the test of whether the claimant lacked capacity to conform their behaviour to the demands imposed by the criminal law. What the justification is for that proposed test was not really explained, nor was its meaning. Not only is it a recipe for uncertainty, but it risks being tantamount to judicial legislation.</a></p><a name="para111"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para111"></a><a name="para112">112. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant advances a related argument that the lack of significant personal responsibility means that there is insufficient turpitude to give rise to an illegality defence. This again ignores the seriousness of a criminal conviction for manslaughter. It is an indictable-only offence punishable by a sentence of life imprisonment. It is a “serious offence” for the purposes of the provisions regarding dangerous offenders in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The plea of guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility means acceptance by the appellant that she possessed the mental prerequisites of criminal responsibility for murder, namely an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. In the present case, the expert psychiatrists also agreed that the appellant knew that what she was doing was morally and legally wrong when she inflicted the stab wounds on her mother. In <i>Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a> Lord Sumption stated at para 23 that: “The paradigm case of an illegal act engaging the defence is a criminal offence.” As Lord Sumption explained at para 29, there may be some exceptional cases where a criminal act will not constitute turpitude. The reservation made in <i>Gray</i> in relation to trivial offences may be an example of such a case, as may be strict liability offences where the claimant is not privy to the facts making his act unlawful. The serious criminal offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility does not come close to falling within such an exception and clearly engages the defence.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim (“the first stage” or “stage (a)”);</p>

It is neither necessary nor desirable that consideration of the relevant policy considerations should give rise to a mini trial. They should usually be capable of being addressed as a matter of argument and at a level of generality that does not make evidence necessary, as is well illustrated by this court’s decision in <i>Hounga v Allen</i>.</a></p><a name="para115"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115"></a><a name="para116">116. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, questions arise as to exactly how under the trio of considerations approach relevant policy considerations are to be weighed. It appears that this must involve a balancing between considerations arising at the first and second stages; the third stage relates to proportionality and factors specific to the case rather than general policy considerations. Stage (a) is directed at policy reasons which support denial of the claim and stage (b) is directed at policy reasons which support denial of the illegality defence. As Lord Toulson makes clear at para 101, stage (b) is meant to operate “conversely” to stage (a).</a></p><a name="para116"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para116"></a><a name="para117">117. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is consistent with the approach of Lord Wilson in <i>Hounga v Allen</i> from which Lord Toulson had drawn support (at para 76). Lord Wilson described the balancing exercise in the following terms at para 42:</a></p><a name="para117"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“So it is necessary, first, to ask ‘What is the aspect of public policy which founds the defence?’ and, second, to ask ‘But is there another aspect of public policy to which the application of the defence would run counter?’”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para117"></a><a name="para118">118. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It also reflects the broad way in which Lord Kerr expressed his understanding of stage (a) at para 124:</a></p><a name="para118"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“By this, I understand Lord Toulson JSC to mean the reasons that a claimant’s conduct should operate to bar him or her from a remedy which would otherwise be available.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para118"></a><a name="para119">119. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that stage (a) should not be interpreted as being confined to the specific purpose of the prohibition transgressed. Whilst that is of great importance, other general policy considerations that impact on the consistency of the law and the integrity of the legal system also fall to be taken into account. In the present case, for example, that would encompass the public policy considerations identified in <i>Gray</i>, namely the consistency principle and the public confidence principle. Similarly, whilst preventing someone from profiting from his own wrong is not the rationale of the illegality defence, it is a relevant policy consideration, which is linked to the need for consistency and coherence in the law. For one branch of the law to enable a person to profit from behaviour which another branch of the law treats as being criminal or otherwise unlawful would tend to produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law, and so cause damage to the integrity of the legal system, as is recognised in <i>Patel</i> (at paras 99 to 101). In cases where it features, it too is a factor to be taken into account, even though it may not reflect the purpose of the prohibition transgressed.</a></p><a name="para119"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para119"></a><a name="para120">120. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the issue of consistency and coherence in the law, the closeness of the connection between the claim and the illegal act may well be of relevance. The closer that connection is, the greater and more obvious may be the inconsistency and consequent risk of harm to the integrity of the legal system. The rejection by the majority in <i>Patel</i> of reliance as the test of illegality did not mean that reliance was thereby rendered irrelevant to the policy-based approach. It may not provide a satisfactory test of illegality, but it will often be a relevant factor.</a></p><a name="para120"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para120"></a><a name="para121">121. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, questions arise as to the weight it may be appropriate to give to different policy considerations. At para 99 Lord Toulson recognised the importance of the policy considerations that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing and that the law should be coherent. Where either or both of these considerations are engaged it would seem appropriate that they are given great weight. This was a point made by Lord Kerr in his judgment at para 143 where he stated as follows:</a></p><a name="para121"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“143.&nbsp; Lord Toulson JSC’s solution to this question also permits readier access to investigation of the traditional justifications for the ex turpi causa maxim - preservation of the integrity of the legal system and preventing profit from wrongdoing. If, on examination of the particular circumstances of the case, these can be shown to weigh heavily in the balance, it is more likely that the defence will be upheld.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para121"></a><a name="para122">122. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would respectfully agree with that approach.</a></p><a name="para122">

In some cases, of which <i>Hounga v Allen</i> is an example, it may be apparent that the balancing of policy considerations comes down firmly against denial of the claim. If so, it will not be necessary to go on to the third stage and the issue of proportionality. This is consistent with Lord Toulson’s statement at para 107 that <span style="color:black">these factors relate to “whether it would be disproportionate to refuse relief to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled” and at para 101 that they fall to be considered to avoid “the possibility of overkill”. In other words, they are a disproportionality check rather than a proportionality requirement.</span></a></p><a name="para123"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para123"></a><a name="para124">124. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to proportionality, at para 107 Lord Toulson identified four factors which were likely to be of particular relevance, namely: “<span style="color:black">the seriousness of the conduct, its centrality [to the transaction], whether it was intentional and whether there was marked disparity in the parties’ respective culpability.” Lord Toulson refrained from saying anything about the potential weight of such factors, no doubt to avoid being prescriptive. I would, however, suggest that centrality will often be a factor of particular importance. When considering the circumstances relating to the illegality, whether there is a causal link between the illegality and the claim, and t</span>he closeness of that causal connection, will often be important considerations.</a></p><a name="para124"> 
<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify">(a)&nbsp; Stage (a) - The underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim</p>

Considering first general policy considerations rather than the purpose of the prohibition, for the reasons explained in <i>Gray</i>, the consistency principle is engaged in this case. There is a need to avoid inconsistency so as to maintain the integrity of the legal system. Whilst that most obviously applies to the narrower rule, it also applies to the wider rule. As <i>Patel</i> makes clear, this is a central and very weighty public policy consideration.</a></p><a name="para125">

Again, this applies to both the narrower and the wider rule.</a></p><a name="para126">

NHS funding is an issue of significant public interest and importance and, if recovery is permitted, funds will be taken from the NHS budget to compensate the appellant for the consequences of her criminal conviction for unlawful killing.</a></p><a name="para127">

The appellant’s crime was the immediate and, on any view, an effective cause of all heads of loss claimed. Indeed, applying Lord Hoffmann’s approach to causation in <i>Gray</i>, with which Lord Rodger and Lord Scott agreed, it was the sole effective cause of such loss.</a></p><a name="para128">

It is clearly in the public interest that everything possible is done to enhance protection of that fundamental right.

Indeed, more generally it is submitted that a person who is not deterred by a criminal sanction is unlikely to be deterred by being deprived of a right to compensation.</a></p><a name="para130">

Looking at the matter more broadly there may well be some deterrent effect in a clear rule that unlawful killing never pays and any such effect is important given the fundamental importance of the right to life. To have such a rule also supports the public interest in public condemnation and due punishment.</a></p><a name="para131">

It is said that it is recognised that imposing a duty of care can enhance standards. There is, however, no issue that a duty of care was owed. Indeed, liability for damages up to the date of the killing is admitted. It is unlikely that limiting the extent of the liability to the victim will affect the exercise of due care. In any event, there is a potential exposure in such cases to claims on behalf of victims as well as to regulatory sanctions. Focusing on the specific factual situation in the present case, there is no ready means of judging the likely consequences of removing the illegality defence from NHS bodies in claims by mental health patients who kill others. As the respondent submits, it does not seem likely that NHS staff or organisations need any encouragement to try to do their best to stop patients killing people.</a></p><a name="para133">

This may be said to beg the question since it assumes that it was the respondent’s negligence which injured the appellant rather than her own criminal act. Even if it was, this is not one of those cases where the injury was the very thing which the respondent was engaged to prevent and it is agreed that the killing by the appellant of her mother could not have been predicted.</a></p><a name="para135">

In particular, as <i>Gray</i> makes clear, the resulting inconsistency in the law is such as to affect the integrity of the legal system. The underlying policy question identified in <i>Patel </i>is accordingly engaged. As stated by McLachlin J in <i>Hall v Hebert</i> </a><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1fs4g">[1993] 2 SCR 159</a> at 182, “concern for the integrity of the legal system trumps the concern that the defendant be responsible”.</p>
