<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In early 2006 the appellant, The United States of America, decided for
strategic reasons to close the watercraft repair centre, known as RSA Hythe,
which the United States Army maintained in Hampshire. The respondent, Mrs
Nolan, was employed there as a civilian budget assistant, and the closure on 30
September 2006 involved her dismissal for redundancy on the previous day. She
brought Employment Tribunal proceedings on 9 November 2006. The proceedings
were brought under Part IV Chapter II, containing sections 188 to 198 of the
Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 as amended by the
Collective Redundancies and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
(Amendment) Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2587). I will call the Act as amended
“TULCRA” and the Regulations by which it was amended “the 1995 Regulations”.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mrs Nolan’s complaint was that the appellant as her employer had, when
proposing to dismiss her and other employees, failed to consult with any
employee representative as required by the procedure for handling collective
redundancies prescribed by Part IV Chapter II of TULCRA. There was no trade
union at the base to represent Mrs Nolan’s and other employees’ interests. Accordingly,
she made her complaint on the basis that she was an “employee representative”
within section 188(1B). The appellant accepts that it made clear in June 2006
that there would be neither discussions nor consultation about the forthcoming
closure. It denies that it was under the alleged duty.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading">State immunity</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant did not rely on state immunity when the proceedings were
begun. It is common ground that it could successfully have done so. Whether
this would have been under the State Immunity Act 1978 or at common law is
presently immaterial. The 1978 Act is under section 16(2) inapplicable to
“proceedings relating to anything done by or in relation to the armed forces of
a state while present in the United Kingdom”. Assuming that section 16(2)
applies, there would have been immunity under common law principles, summarised
by Lord Millett in <i>Holland v Lampen-Wolfe</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/40.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1573</a>, 1583D-F. <i>Littrell
v United States of America (No 2)</i> [1995] 1 WLR 82 is an example of a
successful common law plea of state immunity; see also <i>Sengupta v Republic
of India</i> [1983] ICR 221. As to why there was no plea of state immunity, it
was not apparent at the outset that the duty to consult under section 188 would
apply to the closure of a base, rather than the consequences for employees
after its closure. The potential for this extended understanding of the duty
was only highlighted by the Employment Appeal Tribunal decision on 28 September
2007 in <i>UK Coal Mining Ltd v National Union of Mineworkers (Northumberland
Area) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0397_06_2709.html">[2008] ICR 163</a>. By then, the Employment Tribunal held, it was too
late for the plea of state immunity which the appellant sought at that stage to
raise. The validity of the extended understanding of the duty remains open to

</span>Various types of public employment are or may be taken outside the Part
IV Chapter II, or outside the Act as a whole. Service as a member of the armed
forces and employment which a minister certifies as required to be excepted
from the Act for the purpose of safeguarding national security are taken
entirely outside the Act by sections 274 and 275. Under section 273(1) to (4)
the provisions of Part IV Chapter II of TULCRA have, for present purposes, no
effect “in relation to Crown employment and persons in Crown employment”.
“Crown employment” here means “employment under or for the purposes of a
government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown
functions conferred by an enactment”, and “‘employee’ and ‘contract of
employment’ mean a person in Crown employment and the terms of employment of
such a person” subject to a presently immaterial exception. Employment as a
relevant member of House of Lords or House of Commons staff is outside Part IV
Chapter II under sections 277 and 278. Under section 280, the term “employee”
or “worker” does not include a person in police service, defined as meaning
“service as a member of any constabulary maintained by virtue of an enactment,
or in any other capacity by virtue of which a person has the powers or privileges
of a constable”. Finally, under section 286(2) the Secretary of State may by
order made by statutory instrument provide that the provisions of inter alia
Part IV Chapter II shall not apply to persons or employment of such classes as
the order may prescribe, or shall only apply to them with such exceptions and
modifications as the order may prescribe.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>Part IV Chapter II of TULCRA gives effect to the United Kingdom’s duty
under European Union law to implement Council Directive 98/59/EC and its
predecessor Council Directive 77/187/EEC. As originally enacted, it did not do
so fully, with the result that the Commission brought proceedings against the
United Kingdom which led to a Court of Justice judgment dated 8 June 1994 in
Case C-383/92 </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1994/C38392.html">[1994] ECR I-2479</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1994/C38292.html">[1994] ICR 664</a>. One flaw identified by the
judgment was that TULCRA (and its predecessor the Employment Protection Act
1975) did not require consultation in circumstances where employees did not
enjoy union representation recognised by the employer. The Court of Justice
held that Council Directive 77/187/EEC required member states to ensure that
employee representatives would be designated for consultation purposes in such
circumstances. The 1995 Regulations make provision accordingly by amending
section 188.</p>

</span>While TULCRA in its original form (and its 1975 predecessor) failed
until the 1995 Regulations properly to implement European Union law in certain
respects identified in the Court of Justice’s judgment in Case C-383/92 (para 6

</span>they provided for consultation “at the earliest opportunity” until 1995
(when this was replaced by the Directive requirement “in good time”) and
further provided (as TULCRA continues to do) for specific time limits within
which consultation must occur (there being no such time limits in the Directives);

</span>The proceedings initiated by Mrs Nolan have not taken a straightforward
course. She succeeded before the Employment Tribunal (EJ Guyer, Mrs S Foulser
and Mr M W Heckford), obtaining on 17 March 2008 an order for remuneration for
a one month protected period. The order was on 15 May 2009 upheld on appeal by
the Employment Appeal Tribunal (Slade J, Mr D Norman and Mrs R Chapman). On a
further appeal, the Court of Appeal (Laws, Hooper and Rimer LJJ) on 26 November
2010 ordered that there should be a reference to the Court of Justice on the question,
raised by the decision in <i>UK Coal</i>, whether the obligation to consult
arises “(i) when the employer is proposing, but has not yet made, a strategic
business or operational decision that will foreseeably or inevitably lead to
collective redundancies; or (ii) only when that decision has actually been made
and he is then proposing consequential redundancies?”</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice did not answer this question (Case C-583/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C58310.html">[2013] ICR 193</a>. It raised the issue whether Mrs Nolan’s dismissal by the appellant,
which is not an EU member state, fell within the scope of Directive 98/59/EC,
having regard in particular to article 1(2)(b). Having heard submissions on
this point, the court on 18 October 2012 gave a judgment with two parts. First,
the court held that the Directive was both by virtue of its adoption under
article 100 of the former EC Treaty (now article 94 TEU) and by nature part of
the legislation aimed at improving the internal market; that activities like
national defence, falling within the exercise of public powers, are in
principle excluded from classification as economic activity; and that, by
virtue of article 1(2)(b), the dismissal of staff of a military base falls
outside the scope of the Directive, whether or not the base belongs to a non-member
state (para 43). Secondly, the court addressed Mrs Nolan’s submission that it
should nonetheless rule on the question referred by the Court of Appeal, on the
basis that TULCRA extends the provisions of the Directive in national law to
cover article 1(2)(b) situations (other than in respect of Crown employment or
employees and persons in the police service). The court (disagreeing on this
point with Advocate General Mengozzi’s approach) declined to give any such
ruling on the basis that “If the EU legislature states unequivocally that the
measure which it has adopted does not apply to a precise area, it renounces …
the objective [of] seeking uniform interpretation and application of the rules
of law in that excluded area” (para 55). The upshot was that the Court of
Justice simply declined jurisdiction. So the questions raised by <i>UK Coal</i>/<i>Fujitsu
</i>and the Court of Appeal’s reference will in the present case have to be
resolved, if ever necessary, domestically without further assistance from the
Court of Justice.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Whether it will be necessary to resolve them in this case appears
doubtful. The first part of the Court of Justice’s judgment lent encouragement
to an argument by the appellant that, since EU law did not require or intend a
foreign state to be subject to the Directive’s consultation obligations, United
Kingdom law should be read in the same sense. When the matter came back before
the Court of Appeal after the Court of Justice’s ruling, Mrs Nolan was prepared
to concede the correctness in law of this argument and did not appear. The
Court of Appeal (Moore-Bick, Rimer and Underhill LJJ) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/71.html">[2014] ICR 685</a> after
hearing submissions from Mr John Cavanagh QC and Sir Daniel Bethlehem QC for
the appellant nonetheless dismissed the appeal, and made an order (stayed
pending any appeal to the Supreme Court) that there be a further hearing to
deal with the remaining <i>UK Coal/Fujitsu </i>issue. The appellant duly sought
permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. This was given on the basis that the
appellant bear its own costs in respect of the appeal, including those of any
advocate to the court who might be appointed, and do not seek any costs order
in respect of any instance of the proceedings. The appeal has proceeded on that
basis and The Honourable Michael Beloff QC and Sarah Wilkinson have been
appointed and appeared as advocates to the court. The government, which might
be expected to have an interest in the third point (vires) identified in the
next paragraph, has not sought to intervene.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The issues</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant has through counsel raised two points of construction and
one of vires. The first point of construction, argued by Mr Cavanagh QC, is
that the domestic legal provisions should be given an interpretation conforming
to that given in the first part of the Court of Justice’s judgment, at least as
regards foreign states’ <i>jure imperii</i> activity. By <i>jure imperii</i>,
is here meant any decision or act which is not <i>jure gestionis</i>, (or
commercial) in nature. A state enjoys no general immunity in respect of <i>jure
gestionis</i> decisions or acts. The second point, argued by Sir Daniel
Bethlehem QC, is that the same construction should be reached as regards
foreign states by virtue of or by reference to principles of international law
forming part of or inspiring domestic law. The third point, that of vires,
argued by Mr Cavanagh, is that the 1995 Regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>
section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, in that, when providing
workers without trade union representation with the protection which the Court
of Justice held in (Case C-383/92) to be required, they did not confine
themselves to the sphere of EU law, as confirmed by the court in the present
case, but went further by conferring extended protection on workers without
trade union representation employed by public administrative bodies or public
law establishments.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is some overlap between the considerations relied upon by the
appellant in relation to the two points of construction. The appellant focused
on the overlap, which meant in its submission that TULCRA could not and should
not on any view apply to foreign states’ <i>jure imperii</i> activity. The two
points have however different underlying logics. The logic of the first point
is that TULCRA should be construed so as not to apply to employment by any public
administrative body or public law establishment. The logic of the second is
that TULCRA should be construed so as not to apply to foreign states’ <i>jure
imperii </i>activity. The third point, vires, only arises if neither point of
construction is accepted. It would if accepted have an effect similar to the
first point, but only in circumstances where there is no trade union
representation. In circumstances where there is trade union representation
consultation would be required by primary legislation (TULCRA without reference
to the 1995 Regulations), so that no question of vires could arise.</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="ParaHeading">The first point of construction</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Taking the first point of construction, it is a cardinal principle of
European and domestic law that domestic courts should construe domestic
legislation intended to give effect to a European Directive so far as possible
(or so far as they can do so without going against the “grain” of the domestic
legislation) consistently with that Directive: <i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial
Internacional de Alimentacion SA</i> (Case C-106/89) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/C10689.html">[1990] ECR I-4135</a>, <i>Vodafone
2 v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/446.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 446</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/446.html">[2010] Ch 77</a>, paras
37-38 and <i>Swift v Robertson </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/50.html">[2014] UKSC 50</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/50.html">[2014] 1 WLR 3438</a>, paras
20-21. But that means avoiding so far as possible a construction which would
have the effect that domestic implementing legislation did not fully satisfy
the United Kingdom’s European obligations. Where a Directive offers a member
state a choice, there can be no imperative to construe domestic legislation as
having any particular effect, so long as it lies within the scope of the
permitted. Where a Directive allows a member state to go further than the Directive
requires, there is again no imperative to achieve a “conforming”
interpretation. It may in a particular case be possible to infer that the
domestic legislature did not, by a domestic formulation or reformulation,
intend to go further in substance than the European requirement or minimum. <i>R
(Risk Management Partners Ltd) v Brent London Borough Council </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/21.html">[2011] UKSC 7</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/21.html">[2011] 2 AC 34</a>, considered below, is a case where the Supreme Court implied
into apparently unqualified wording of domestic Regulations a limitation
paralleling in scope that which had been implied by the Court of Justice into
general wording of the Directive to which the Regulations were giving effect:
see <i>Teckal Srl v Comune di Viano</i> (Case C-107/98) [1999] ECR I–8121 (“<i>Teckal</i>”).
It concluded that the two had been intended to be effectively back-to-back. A
reformulation may also have been aimed at using concepts or tools familiar in a
domestic legal context, rather than altering the substantive scope or effect of
the domestic measure from that at the European level. But that is as far as it
goes.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Directive 98/59/EC introduces requirements in favour of workers engaged
in fields of economic activity. But it leaves it open to member states to apply
or introduce even more favourable laws, regulations or administrative
provisions than those it requires (article 5), and, whether or not article 5
confirms this, it certainly leaves it open to member states to apply or
introduce similar or more favourable provisions in areas of non-economic
activity, such as those of workers employed by public administrative bodies or
public law establishments excluded from the Directive because of its internal
market base and focus.</a></p><a name="para15">

appellant’s case that the Regulations must be limited in scope by reference to
the Directive. The Supreme Court in <i>Risk Management </i>applied under the
Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/5), passed to give effect to Council
Directive 2004/18/EC, similar reasoning to that adopted by the Court of Justice

and environmental services to the participating authorities. Teckal challenged
this decision as breaching Directive 93/36/EEC (a predecessor to Directive
2004/18/EC) on supply of goods. The Court of Justice examined the principles
determining whether the new arrangement fell within the Directive 93/36/EEC,
which contained the following definitions in article 1:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘public supply contracts’

in addition include siting and installation operations;</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice gave this guidance:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, in
accordance with article 1(a) of Directive 93/36, it is, in principle,
sufficient if the contract was concluded between, on the one hand, a local
authority and, on the other, a person legally distinct from that local
authority. The position can be otherwise only in the case where the local
authority exercises over the person concerned a control which is similar to
that which it exercises over its own departments and, at the same time, that
person carries out the essential part of its activities with the controlling
local authority or authorities.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to the

a contracting authority, such as a local authority, plans to conclude in

it in regard to decision-making, a contract for pecuniary interest for the
supply of products, whether or not that entity is itself a contracting

through the public contract award procedure required by the 2006 Regulations.
The Regulations applied to a “public services contract”, defined as:</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a contract, in writing, for
consideration (whatever the nature of the consideration) under which a
contracting authority engages a person to provide services but does not include
- a public works contract; or a public supply contract; …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Regulations contained a list of “contracting
authorities” which included “a local authority”. Article 1 of the Directive, to
which the Regulations gave effect, applied to public contracts, defined as:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“contracts for pecuniary interest
concluded in writing between one or more economic operators and one or more
contracting authorities and having as their object the execution of works, the

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Directive defined “contracting authorities” as
meaning:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the state, regional or local

</span>There was nothing in the Regulations in issue in <i>Risk Management </i>positively
to have prevented the legislator going further than European law required.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court in <i>Risk Management </i>read the wording as
qualified so as to have a like scope to that which the Court of Justice had
given the Directive in issue in <i>Teckal.</i> The Supreme Court’s reasoning is
however important. In his leading judgment, Lord Hope of Craighead noted that
the <i>Teckal </i>exemption was “not referred to anywhere in the Directive. It
is a judicial gloss on its language” (para 17), and went on to say (para 22)
that:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the basis for implying the Teckal
exemption into the 2006 Regulations is to be found in their underlying purpose,
which was to give effect to the Directive. The absence of any reference to the
exemption in the Regulations is of no more significance than the absence of any
reference to it in the Directive that was being transposed. The exemption in
favour of contracts which satisfy its conditions was read into the Directive by
the Court of Justice in <i>Teckal</i> because it was thought to be undesirable
for contracts of that kind to be opened up for public procurement. This was not
just a technicality. It was a considered policy of EU law. It would be odd if a
significant and policy-based exemption were to apply in some member states and
not others, especially as one of the aims of the Directive was to harmonise
procedures. …”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the other leading judgment in the case, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry said
to like effect (para 92):</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para21">“The 2006 Regulations give effect
to the Directive in English law. In other words, they are the way in which
English law secures the free movement of services and the opening-up to
undistorted competition in relation to contracts which are to be placed by
English local authorities. That being the purpose of the Regulations, they,
too, cannot be meant to apply in circumstances where that purpose is not
relevant because a contracting authority intends to contract with a body which
is not properly to be regarded as an outside body. Although the <i>Teckal</i>
criteria were formulated with particular reference to the predecessors of the
Directive, they are simply a way of identifying situations where the authority
can be regarded as obtaining the products or services which it requires
in-house and, so, where there is no need to secure the free movement of
services and the opening-up to undistorted competition. In my view, the
criteria are an equally good indication of situations where, for that reason,
the 2006 Regulations have no application. The insight of Advocate General
Trstenjak in para 83 of her opinion in <i>Coditel Brabant</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2008/C32407.html">[2008] ECR I-8457</a>,
8482 is instructive. To hold that the Regulations did apply in these
circumstances would involve saying that the legislature intended to attach
weight to competition law objectives in an area where they have no legitimate
application. This would, in turn, involve inappropriate interference with local
authorities’ right to co-operate in discharging their public functions.”</p>

</span>Lord Hope’s further observations about the domestic legal history of the
Regulations are relevant not only to construction, but also to the third point
on vires, which I consider later. He said (para 24):</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para22">“As Waller LJ said in <i>Oakley
Inc v Animal Ltd (Secretary of State for Trade and Industry intervening)</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1191.html">[2006] Ch 337</a>, para 39, the primary objective of any secondary legislation
under section 2(2) must be to bring into force laws which, under the Treaties,
the United Kingdom has agreed to make part of its laws. There is nothing in the
explanatory memorandum to the Regulations that was prepared by the Office of
Government Commerce and laid before Parliament to indicate that it was intended
to depart from the jurisprudence of the court as to the scope of the Directive.
In paras 7.2-7.4 of the memorandum it was stated that the change to the
legislation was necessary to implement the new public procurement Directive,
that it clarified and modernised the previous texts and that the simpler and
more consistent public sector text should reduce the burdens involved under the
EU rules. If the <i>Teckal</i> exemption were to be held not to apply to the
2006 Regulations, it could only be because the purpose of the Regulations was
to apply the public procurement rules to relationships that fell outside the
regime provided for by the Directive. But that would not be consistent with the
memorandum, and it would not be a permitted use of the power.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Risk Management</i>, the indications were that the domestic
measure was intended in the relevant respect to be no more than back-to-back
with the European Directive. That cannot be said to be so in the present case.
TULCRA contains no equivalent of article 1(2)(b) of the Directive. Instead, it
contains specific and limited exceptions for Crown employment and employees and
for certain others in public service. It is true that the remainder of the
category of public workers comprised by article 1(2)(b) would have been
relatively confined, comprising those engaged in the “exercise of public
powers”, rather than economic functions, as the Court of Justice indicated in <i>Scattolon
v Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università, e della Ricerca </i>(Case
C-108/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C10810_O.html">[2012] ICR 740</a>, paras 43-44. But this remaining category is
nonetheless significant. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, its inclusion
within the scope of TULCRA cannot have been mere oversight. The careful
exclusion of several specified categories of public employee speaks for itself.
The variation of the Directive scheme enables, and according to the Employment
Appeal Tribunal (para 84) has in many cases enabled, cases to be brought by
those representing workers in public authorities. There are also other respects
in which provisions of TULCRA have given protection in the form of consultation
obligations which extends or has in the past extended, clearly deliberately,
beyond the European requirement. It is, as Underhill LJ observed in the Court
of Appeal (para 24) well understandable that a Labour government should in
1975, with trade union encouragement, have decided to give the scheme an
extended domestic application to public employees.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That does not mean that the legislator in the present case necessarily
realised or foresaw the existence of employees of a public authority consisting
of a foreign non-EU member state such as the appellant, operating within the
United Kingdom a base with its own employees. The appellant is the only foreign
state with military bases in the United Kingdom, and it appears that civilian
employees at United States Air Force (as distinct from Army) bases in the
United Kingdom were and are, it seems, employed by the Crown. But the fact that
a particular rare situation affecting a foreign state has not been foreseen is
no reason for reading into clear legislation a specific exemption which would
not reflect the wording or scope of any exemption in European law.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly so, when the natural reaction to any suggestion
that a foreign state might be adversely affected in its <i>jure imperii </i>decisions
- taken, according to the appellant, at the level of the US Secretary of
Defense and US Secretary of the Army and in Washington - would have been that
the foreign state would be entitled to rely on state immunity, in response to
any suggestion that it should have consulted with its workforce in relation to
a strategic decision to close any such facility. While there is no positive
indication that this played a part in legislative or ministerial thinking, it
is a factor of relevance when considering whether objectively TULCRA must be
read as containing any such implied limitation as the appellant suggests.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal and the advocates to the court also referred to
section 188(7), with its limitation under “special circumstances” of any
obligation to consult to whatever might be “reasonably practicable in those
circumstances”. It may be that this could be of assistance to the appellant, in
resisting a claim that it had breached the consultation obligations in section
188. But to my mind it provides an unconvincing basis for any conclusion that
this was, or is objectively, the way in the legislator should be seen as having
catered for the possible anomalies that might flow from expecting a sovereign
state to consult about a <i>jure imperii </i>decision to close a naval or
military facility. Section 188(7) is directed to special factual situations
raising issues of feasibility apt for evaluation by the Employment Tribunal. It
is much less obviously designed for situations where consultation might be
thought to be incongruous for high policy reasons.</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="ParaHeading">The second point of construction</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn therefore to the second point of construction and to the
additional considerations which it raises. As in the courts below, so before us
the arguments advanced have been, as Slade J described them, both sophisticated
and imaginative. They have also been careful and helpful in enabling the court
to reach a conclusion on them. But like the courts below, I would reject them.
In substance, Sir Daniel Bethlehem’s submission on behalf of the appellant is
that international legal considerations should lead to the recognition by the court
of a tailored exemption from TULCRA in respect of dismissals involving
redundancies arising from a <i>jure imperii</i> decision taken by a foreign
state. He does not suggest that, if TULCRA otherwise applies, the appellant
enjoys any defence outside TULCRA (such as act of state, which would only here
arise if the challenge was to a decision or act of the appellant in the United
States). His case depends on construing TULCRA as inapplicable to what happened.
His starting point is the prima facie presumption that the legislator intends
to legislate consistently with, and that legislation (if reasonably capable of
being so construed) should be construed consistently with, the principles of
international law: <i>Salomon v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>[1967] 2 QB 116, <i>Alcom
Ltd v Republic of Columbia</i> [1984] 1 AC 580 and <i>Assange v Swedish
Prosecution Authority </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/22.html">[2012] UKSC 22</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/22.html">[2012] 2 AC 471</a>, para 10.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Reduced to their essence, his submissions regarding international law are
that:</a></p><a name="para28">

</span>the application of TULCRA to dismissals of this nature would conflict
with settled international law principles that one state does not legislate to
affect the <i>jure imperii </i>activity of another;</p>

</span>it would place the appellant in a unique position of potentially
infringing United Kingdom law, by failing to consult, when the Crown in respect
of British bases would have no such obligation, and when EU principles of
non-discrimination would mean that other member states would also have to be
regarded as having no such obligation; it would in that respect infringe either
EU law or general international legal principles regarding non-discrimination.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction is primarily territorial in both international and domestic
law. As the Permanent Court of International Justice said in <i>The Case of the
SS “Lotus” </i>(1927)<i> </i>PCIJ Series A – No 10, pp 18-19, that:</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the first and foremost
restriction imposed by international law upon a state is that - failing the
existence of a permissive rule to the contrary - it may not exercise its power
in any form in the territory of another state. In this sense jurisdiction is
certainly territorial; it cannot be exercised by a state outside its territory
except by virtue of a permissive rule derived from international custom or from
a convention. It does not, however, follow that international law prohibits a state
from exercising jurisdiction in its own territory, in respect of any case which
relates to acts which have taken place abroad, and in which it cannot rely on
some permissive rule of international law. Such a view would only be tenable if
international law contained a general prohibition to states to extend the
application of their laws and the jurisdiction of their courts to persons,
property and acts ‘outside their territory’, and if, as an exception to this
general prohibition, it allowed states to do so in certain specific cases. But
this is certainly not the case under international law as it stands at present.
Far from laying down a general prohibition to the effect that states may not
extend the application of their laws and the jurisdiction of their courts to
persons, property and acts outside their territory, it leaves them in this
respect a wide measure of discretion which is only limited in certain cases by
prohibitive rules; as regards other cases, every state remains free to adopt
the principles which it regards as best and most suitable.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The starting-point in this part
of the law is the presumption that jurisdiction (in all its forms) is
territorial, and may not be exercised extra-territorially without some specific
basis in international law. However, the territorial theory has been refined in
the light of experience and what amounts to extra-territorial jurisdiction is
to some extent a matter of appreciation. If there is a cardinal principle
emerging, it is that of genuine connection between the subject-matter of jurisdiction
and the territorial base or reasonable interests of the state in question.”</p>

</span>In the present case, the United Kingdom was in my opinion legislating in
TULCRA entirely consistently with these principles. TULCRA is expressly stated
to extend to England, Wales and Scotland. Part IV Chapter II regulates the
procedures for dismissal on the grounds of redundancy of employees at
institutions in those territories. It requires consultation within the
jurisdiction with employees who are and whose employment is within the
jurisdiction. Merely because the appellant may have taken a decision at the
highest level in Washington, which led to dismissals on grounds of redundancy
at a base in England, does not mean that the United Kingdom was legislating
extra-territorially. It is in this sort of situation that a plea of state
immunity may be most useful.</a></p><a name="para31">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sir Daniel Bethlehem referred to the American legal position, in
particular the American Law Institute Restatement (Third) of the Foreign
Relations Law of the United States (published May 14, 1986) and the United
States Supreme Court decision of <i>F Hoffmann-la-Roche v Empagran SA</i>
(2004) 542 US 155). Section 402 of the Reinstatement indicates that, subject to
section 403, a state has jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to “(a)
conduct that, wholly or in substantial part, takes place within its territory;
(b) the status of persons, or interests in things, present within its
territory; (c) conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have
substantial effect within its territory”. The qualification in section 403 is
that, even when one of the bases for jurisdiction under section 402 is present,
“a state may not exercise jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to a
person or activity having connections with another state when the exercise of
such jurisdiction is unreasonable”, this to be determined “by evaluating all
relevant factors”. The drafters seek to give this evaluation some bones by
listing eight potentially relevant (but not exclusive) factors. Among them are
“(a) … the extent to which the activity takes place within the territory, or
has substantial, direct and foreseeable effect upon or in the territory” and
“(c) the character of the activity to be regulated, the importance of
regulation to the regulating state, the extent to which other states regulate
such activities …”.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The US Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Hoffmann-la-Roche</i> illustrates
the significance of the principles in the Restatement. The case concerned the
ambit of the Sherman Act in relation to a price-fixing conspiracy between
foreign and domestic vitamin sellers allegedly raising prices both inside and
outside the United States. The issue was whether the Sherman Act applied to
purchases (described as “foreign transactions”) by foreign distributors for
delivery by Hoffmann-la-Roche outside the United States. The Foreign Trade
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (“FTAIA”) provided that the Sherman Act
“shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce … with foreign nations
unless (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable
effect – (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign
nations <i>[ie domestic trade or commerce]</i> …” (15 USC section 6a). The
words “trade or commerce with foreign nations” were by the court held to cover
foreign transactions. But the Court of Appeals had held that the qualifying
words (“unless …”) brought all transactions, foreign and domestic within the
Sherman Act. The US Supreme Court disagreed, holding that so far as the complaint
depended on an adverse foreign effect on prices independent of any adverse
domestic effect, it lay outside the scope of the Sherman Act.</a></p><a name="para33">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Breyer JA, giving the judgment of the court, identified two main
reasons, derived from comity and the statutory history, for concluding that the
FTAIA did not bring independently caused foreign injury within the scope of the
Sherman Act. In their light he rejected linguistic arguments to the contrary
advanced by the complainants. As to the first reason, comity, he said, in Part
IV of the judgment (with characteristic emphasis, as italicised):</a></p><a name="para34">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… this court ordinarily construes
ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign
authority of other nations. … This rule of construction reflects principles of
customary international law — law that (we must assume) Congress ordinarily
seeks to follow. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United
States sections 403(1), 403(2) (1986) (hereinafter Restatement) (limiting the
unreasonable exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction with respect to a person or
activity having connections with another state); <i>Murray v Schooner Charming
Betsy</i>, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804) (“[A]n act of Congress ought never to be
construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction
remains”); …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">This rule of statutory
construction cautions courts to assume that legislators take account of the
legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American laws.
It thereby helps the potentially conflicting laws of different nations work
together in harmony—a harmony particularly needed in today’s highly
interdependent commercial world.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">No one denies that America’s
antitrust laws, when applied to foreign conduct, can interfere with a foreign nation’s
ability independently to regulate its own commercial affairs. But our courts
have long held that application of our antitrust laws to foreign
anticompetitive conduct is nonetheless reasonable, and hence consistent with
principles of prescriptive comity, insofar as they reflect a legislative effort
to redress <i>domestic</i> antitrust injury that foreign anticompetitive
conduct has caused. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">But why is it reasonable to apply
those laws to foreign conduct <i>insofar as that conduct causes independent
foreign harm and that foreign harm alone gives rise to the plaintiff’s claim</i>?
Like the former case, application of those laws creates a serious risk of
interference with a foreign nation's ability independently to regulate its own
commercial affairs. But, unlike the former case, the justification for that
interference seems insubstantial. See Restatement section 403(2) (determining
reasonableness on basis of such factors as connections with regulating nation,
harm to that nation’s interests, extent to which other nations regulate, and
the potential for conflict). Why should American law supplant, for example,
Canada’s or Great Britain’s or Japan’s own determination about how best to
protect Canadian or British or Japanese customers from anticompetitive conduct
engaged in significant part by Canadian or British or Japanese or other foreign
companies?”</p>

</span>The FTAIA was capable of interpretation in two senses. An interpretation
which excluded from its grasp foreign transactions causing foreign damage was,
for the reasons given in this passage, readily available and understandable.
The present case presents a different picture. There is no lack of clarity in
the wording of TULCRA. The base at RSA Hythe, the complainants, the contracts
of employment and the dismissals for redundancy which were regulated (on the
face of it) by TULCRA were and are all within the United Kingdom. I am ready to
assume that the base was operated in the United Kingdom for strategic reasons,
and it is common ground that the decision to close it was taken in the United
States for strategic reasons. The appellant’s case is that there should be
carved out of TULCRA, or any other relevant legislation, an exception for
circumstances in which a foreign state takes a decision or commits an act of a <i>jure
imperii</i> nature abroad which would otherwise lead to a person in the United
Kingdom having a domestic right and remedy in respect of domestic employment or
other domestic activity in the United Kingdom. The submission is far-reaching.
It would require substantial re-formulation and expansion of the presumptive
principles of construction referred to in the Restatement and in <i>Hoffmann-la-Roche</i>,
and I am unable to accept it.</a></p><a name="para35">

</span>The submission would amount, in effect, as Sir Daniel recognised, to
reading domestic legislation as subject to an exception or as inapplicable, at
least prima facie, in relation to a foreign state in any circumstances where
the foreign state could rely on a plea of state immunity, to avoid the
adjudicative processes of another state in which proceedings had been brought
against it. I do not accept that there is any such principle. It would make
quite largely otiose the procedures and time for a plea of state immunity. As
Hazel Fox CMG QC and Philippa Webb observe in <i>The Law of State Immunity</i> 3rd
ed (2013), p 20:</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Jurisdiction and immunity are two
separate concepts. Jurisdiction relates to the power of a state to affect the
rights of a person or persons by legislative, executive or judicial means,
whereas immunity represents the independence and exemption from the
jurisdiction or competence of the courts and tribunals of a foreign state and
is an essential characteristic of a state. Logically the existence of
jurisdiction precedes the question of immunity from such jurisdiction but the
two are ‘inextricably linked’ (see Chapter IV).”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In Chapter IV, p 82, the authors go on further to explain
the relationship, in this passage:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Immunity comports freedom or
exemption from territorial jurisdiction. It bars the bringing of proceedings in
the courts of the territorial state (the forum state) against another state. It
says nothing about the underlying liability which the claimant alleges.
Immunity does not confer impunity; the underlying accountability or substantive
responsibility for the matters alleged in a claim remain; immunity merely bars
the adjudication of that claim in a particular court. …</p>

</span>In its written case, para 116, the appellant put the same point in a way
which met with the advocates to the court’s assent:</a></p><a name="para37">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A state’s latitude to assert
immunity in the face of a claim is different from the inapplicability of the
law, by way of exemption or otherwise, to the impugned conduct of the foreign state
in the first place. Immunity operates as a bar to the adjudicative jurisdiction
of the courts of the forum state. It does not address the legislative or prescriptive
jurisdiction of that state. A claim of immunity thus at some level acknowledges
the forum state’s legislative competence and the putative application of the
domestic law in question to the foreign state but for the assertion of
immunity.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sir Daniel Bethlehem sought to emphasise the importance for a foreign
state such as the appellant of recognising in TULCRA an implied exemption for a
decision to dismiss for redundancy taken on <i>jure imperii</i> grounds. The
appellant would wish to comply with domestic law, and the ability to plead
state immunity in any proceedings would not alter the fact that, without such
an exemption, it would be and have been in breach of domestic law. That is
true, but carried to its logical conclusion it would mean that all legislation
should, however clear in scope, be read as inapplicable to a foreign state in
any case where the state could plead state immunity. That would elide two
distinct principles, and, as noted already, very largely make redundant a plea
of state immunity at least in respect of any statutory claim. On Sir Daniel’s
argument, the legislation relating to unfair dismissal on which the claimant
relied in <i>Sengupta v Republic of India</i> [1983] ICR 221 would presumably
also have to be read as containing an implied exception for foreign states in <i>jure
imperii </i>contexts, as would perhaps also the principles of common law
negligence on which the claimant relied in <i>Littrell v United States of
America (No 2)</i> [1995] 1 WLR 82.</a></p><a name="para38">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sir Daniel Bethlehem’s submissions on discrimination start with the
exclusion from the scope of Part IV Chapter II of TULCRA of Crown and police
service employees. The exclusion is specific, and that itself makes it difficult
to argue for an equivalent implied exclusion in respect of foreign state
employees. In any event, there are circumstances in which, even on Sir Daniel’s
case, it would not be inappropriate for Part IV Chapter II to apply to a
foreign government, for example in the (admittedly perhaps rare) case where a
foreign state was itself responsible for a commercial activity in the United
Kingdom, in respect of which it wished to declare all or some of its employees
redundant.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Be that as it may be, Sir Daniel argues that non-discrimination is a
general principle of international law. It was in terms accepted as such by the
Court of Appeal in <i>Benkharbouche v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/33.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 33</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/33.html">[2015] 3 WLR 301</a>, para 61, but the context there was a claim by an
individual foreign employee, asserting that section 4 of the State Immunity Act
was contrary to articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and/or European Union law. (This was
because it only lifted a foreign state’s immunity in favour employees with
contracts made in the United Kingdom or work to be wholly or partly performed
there if such employees were nationals of or habitually resident in the United
Kingdom.) A state cannot take advantage of articles 6 and 14 of the European
Convention. Articles 1 and 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
article 14 of the European Convention, cited by the Court of Appeal, are
likewise all provisions by states in favour of persons, not states. I will
return to articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union, which the Court of Appeal also cited.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The position as between states is expressed in <i>Oppenheim’s
International Law</i> 9th ed (1992) as follows, at para 114:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although states are equal as
legal persons in international law, this equality does not require that in all
matters a state must treat all other states in the same way. There is in customary
international law no clearly established general obligation on a state not to
differentiate between other states in the treatment it accords to them. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Nevertheless, discrimination is
widely regarded as undesirable, and in some particular respects a rule of
non-discrimination may exist, within limits which are not clear. …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Oppenheim goes on to discuss some possibilities, eg
multi-lateral treaties, none of which is relevant here.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To give teeth to his submissions, Sir Daniel Bethlehem invokes European
Union law, to which the Court of Appeal in <i>Benkharbouche </i>also referred.
Article 18 TFEU provides:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Within the scope of application
of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained
therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The European Parliament and the
Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may
adopt rules designed to prohibit such discrimination.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para42">A provision in, effectively, the same terms as the first
sentence is contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, article 21(2). On
the basis of these provisions, Sir Daniel argues that United Kingdom courts
would have to recognise other member states of the European Union as enjoying
like exemptions from TULCRA to those TULCRA provides for UK Crown employees.
This would in principle leave non-EU states out on a limb, but the only non-EU
state actually shown to be affected would in practice be or be likely to be the
appellant. That would, Sir Daniel submits, be absurd and should itself lead to
an implication that foreign states should enjoy the like immunity. In any
event, he submits, the principle of non-discrimination operates under European
Union law horizontally to protect the appellant, even though it is neither a
European citizen or an EU member state; in this connection, Sir Daniel invokes
the Court of Justice’s well-known if controversial jurisprudence in <i>Mangold
v Helm</i> (Case C-144/04) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C14404.html">[2006] All ER (EC) 383</a> and <i>Kücükdeveci v Swedex

of age discrimination.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Whether article 18 TFEU and/or article 21(2) of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights apply in favour of member states can be left open. Whether,
if they do, it would be open to a member state to rely on them horizontally as
against a complainant like Mrs Nolan can also be left open. It is not clear in
European law how far and when the principles in <i>Mangold </i>and <i>Kücükdeveci
</i>apply in cases not involving age discrimination. The court considered such
an issue in <i>Association de médiation sociale v Union locale des Syndicates
CGT</i> (Case C-176/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C17612.html">[2014] ICR 411</a>. The domestic Labour Code excluded from
calculation “holders of an accompanied-employment contract” (young persons
being directed towards more stable employment or social activities), of whom
the Association de médiation sociale (“AMS”), a private non-profit making
organisation, employed well over 100. The result of the exclusion was that AMS
counted as having only eight employees under the Labour Code, and so fell
domestically below a threshold of 50 (based on the Directive 2002/14/EC) which
would otherwise have triggered obligations on its part to inform and consult.
The court held that the Labour Code by excluding accompanied-employees from the
calculation of numbers was in breach of the Directive.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 27 of the Charter requires that “Workers or their
representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and
consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by
Union law and national laws and practices”. The question thus arose whether
article 27 of the Charter, read with the Directive, could be relied on
horizontally in proceedings between AMS and the Union locale des Syndicates.
Differing on this point from Advocate General P Cruz Villalón, the Court of
Justice held that it could not, saying that it was “clear from the wording of
article 27 of the Charter that, for this article to be fully effective, it must
be given more specific expression in European Union or national law” (para 45).
This was so although the Labour Code must, it appears, have contained specific
provisions regarding information and consultation for those employers who,
under its own defective method of calculation, did have 50 or more employees.
So it is at least open to question whether article 18 TFEU or article 21(2) of
the Charter, read with the provisions of TULCRA, would necessarily have direct
horizontal effect in favour of another EU member state.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are however to my mind two fundamental flaws in Sir Daniel’s
submissions at this point. The first is that articles 18 and 21(2) apply
expressly only within the scope of application of European law, or, as it was
paraphrased in <i>Association de médiation sociale</i>, para 42, “in … situations
governed by European law”. The same point was made by the Court of Justice as
long ago as 1974 in <i>Walrave v Association Union Cycliste Internationale</i> (Case
C-36/74) [1974] ECR 1405. In the present case, the Court of Justice declined to
rule on the interpretation of Directive 98/59/EC for the very reason that, to
the extent that TULCRA covers workers employed by public administrative bodies
or by public law establishments, it goes beyond European Union law into an area
to which “the EU legislature states unequivocally that the measure which it has
adopted does not apply”, and in which “the objective [of] seeking uniform
interpretation and application of the rules of law” has been renounced: para
55. Since the issue in the present case arises in precisely that area, it is
not possible to conclude that the appellant or indeed any EU member state, let
alone any non-member state, could insist on European Union law as giving it any
horizontal or other entitlement.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second flaw is that I do not regard a non-member state as being
within the protection of articles 18 and 21(2) in any circumstances. In <i>Patmalniece
v Secretary of State for Work</i> <i>and Pensions</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/11.html">[2011] UKSC 11</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/11.html">[2011] 1 WLR 783</a>, para 83, Lady Hale said of the then equivalent article:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This is not a general prohibition
of discrimination on grounds of nationality. Only the nationals of member states
are protected. Discrimination against third country nationals is not prohibited.
Indeed it is positively expected. The underlying purpose is to promote the
objects of the Union and in particular the free movement of workers between the
member states and the free establishment of businesses within them.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Court of Justice’s case law is to like effect: <i>Vatsouras
v Arbeitsgemeinschaft (AGRE) Nürnberg 900</i> (Joined Cases C-22/08 and C-23/08)
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C2208_O.html">[2009] ECR I-4585</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C2208.html">[2009] ALL ER (EC) 747</a>, para 52 and <i>Martinez Sala v

Appeal recently reached the same conclusion in <i>Sanneh v Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/49.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 49</a>, para 106. The freedom of this
country’s universities to charge unrestricted tuition fees to non-EU citizens,
while having in this respect to assimilate citizens of other EU countries with
British citizens, is an example of the impact of this principle.</p>

</span>I come to the third point, the appellant’s submission that the 1995
Regulations were ultra vires section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972.
When providing workers without trade union representation with the protection
which the Court of Justice had in (Case C-383/92) held to be required, the
Regulations did not confine themselves to the sphere of EU law, confirmed by
the court in the present case. They went further by conferring extended
protection on workers without trade union representation employed by public
administrative bodies or public law establishments. In that respect, the
appellant submits, they went beyond any power conferred by section 2.</a></p><a name="para48">

have effect. Section 2(2) concerns obligations of the United Kingdom to be
implemented, or rights of the United Kingdom to be enjoyed, under or by virtue

As article 288 indicates, Directives are not as specific as Regulations in
their impact or, often, in their terms. Member states have a degree of latitude
in their implementation, provided they achieve the intended result. Paragraph

</span>In issuing the Registered Designs Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3949), the
Secretary of State made use of this option. By regulation 12 he retained in
force the Registered Designs Act 1949, as amended in 1988, in relation to
designs already registered, so making use of this option. The Court of Appeal
rejected the submission that regulation 12 required primary legislation. All
three members of the court considered that regulation 12 could be regarded as
being within section 2(2)(a) of the 1972 Act, as having been for the purpose of
implementing an EU obligation or enabling one to be implemented (para 29, per
Waller LJ, para 46 per May LJ and paras 64-67 per Jacob LJ).</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All three members of the court also went on to express views on the
scope of section 2(2)(b). Waller LJ considered that the words used in section
2(2)(b) must “take their context from … the primary purpose of section 2”, that
being “the bringing into force under section 2 of the laws, which under the
Treaties the United Kingdom has agreed to make part of its laws”; para 39. On
that basis he added this in the same paragraph:</a></p><a name="para56">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… section 2(2)(b), from its
position in section 2, from the fact that it adds something to both subsections
(1) and (2), and from its very wording is a subsection to enable further
measures to be taken which naturally arise from or closely relate to the
primary purpose being achieved. I accept that I will be accused of adding the
words ‘naturally’ and ‘closely’, but I believe that describes the context which
provides the meaning of the words.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>May LJ said (para 47):</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not consider that to hold
that the making of these transitional provisions came within section 2(2)(a)
has the effect of making section 2(2)(b) devoid of content. There is a
distinction between providing something which, although it is a choice, is a
choice which the implementation of the Directive requires you to make, and one
which is not so required, but which has the effect of tidying things up or
making closely related original choices which the Directive does not
necessarily require. Section 2(2)(b) is confined by its words and context.
Redefinition in the abstract is to be avoided.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jacob LJ addressed the topic in some detail. He had no doubt that section
2(2)(a) covered the case where a Directive contains explicit alternatives and
the implementing statutory instrument merely selects one of these (para 73).
Questioning whether it also covers the supply of detail which Directives
frequently leave to member states to spell out, he observed that, in his view,
“the wider section 2(2)(a), the narrower section 2(2)(b) is likely to be” (para
74). In paras 79-80 he expressed his provisional views:</a></p><a name="para58">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own view, provisional
though it must be in the absence of any specific context relevant to this case,
is this: that section 2(2)(a) covers all forms of implementation – whether by
way of choice of explicit options or by way of supply of detail. Both of these
are ‘for the purpose of implementing’ or ‘enabling any such obligation to be
implemented’. Supplying detail required by a Directive is just that.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So section 2(2)(b)
indeed adds more …. How much more must depend on the particular circumstances
of the case – the statutory language is the guide. It says “for the purpose of
dealing with matters arising out of or related to”. Whether a particular
statutory instrument falls within those words must depend on what it purports
to do and the overall context. One cannot put a gloss on the meaning. If Otton
LJ [in <i>R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Ex p UNISON</i> [1996] ICR 1003] was adding a gloss – ‘distinct, separate or divorced from it’ – then
I do not agree with that gloss. You just have to apply the statutory language
to the case concerned. And in doing so you bear in mind that the purpose of the
power given by the section is European – the article10 purpose. Whether or not
Otton LJ was right in the circumstances of, I … do not decide. It would not be
right to do so in the absence of the affected parties.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The reference to Otton LJ’s words
was to a sentence in which Otton LJ said that he was satisfied that the
provision made was “related to a Community obligation, and not distinct,
separate, or divorced from it” (<i>R v Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, Ex p UNISON</i> [1996] ICR 1003, 1014G-H).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Article 10 of the then Treaty
establishing the European Community read:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">“Member states shall take all
appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of
the obligations arising out of this Treaty or resulting from action taken by
the institutions of the Community. …”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some general observations are possible, arising from these passages.
First, so far as possible, it is clearly desirable to avoid paraphrase, though
almost impossible to do so completely, if any greater light is to be shed on
the scope of their application. Second, as Waller LJ (and also May LJ)
indicated, words such as those used in section 2(2) must be seen in the context
of “the primary purpose of section 2”, that being “the bringing into force
under section 2 of the laws, which under the Treaties the United Kingdom has
agreed to make part of its laws”. Third, that is the context in which
Parliament was prepared to delegate law-making ability to the executive –
because the focus of section 2(2) is on obligations to the implementation of
which the United Kingdom is already committed (and rights to which it is
already entitled) at the European level by virtue of its EU membership.
Parliament will itself have had prior opportunities for scrutiny of, and input
into the content of, the European measures giving rise to such obligations and
rights, through in particular Select Committee procedures, at the stage when
such measures were being developed and proposed by the European Commission and
considered in Europe by member states and the European Parliament.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourth, section 2(2) authorises the making of provisions for two
differently expressed purposes. In the case of paragraph (a), the purpose
expressed is implementing or enabling the implementation of any EU obligation
(or the enabling the exercise of any EU right enjoyed by the United Kingdom).
In the case of paragraph (b), it is “dealing with matters arising out of or related
to any such obligation or rights or the coming into force, or the operation
from time to time, of” section 2(1). It is not in my view appropriate to get
too involved in a linguistic debate about whether these paragraphs should be
read entirely disjunctively or whether there may be some overlap. But Jacob LJ
was, I think, right in saying that “the wider section 2(2)(a), the narrower
section 2(2)(b) is likely to be” – that is so, because the language of
paragraph (b) introduces bottom line limitations of the power it confers.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What can in my view be said, from the wording and positioning of these
two paragraphs, is that paragraph (a) is the main vehicle for implementation of
EU obligations and rights which are not directly enforceable. Paragraph (b)
goes further, in authorising provision for different purposes, but those
purposes are limited by reference to the United Kingdom’s EU obligations or
rights (or the coming into force, or operation, of section 2(1)). The words
“arising out of” limit the power to provisions dealing with matters
consequential upon an EU obligation or right (or the coming into force, etc, of
section 2(1)). The further phrase “related to any such obligation or rights”,
must, unless redundant, go somewhat further. But the relationship required must
exist objectively; and the positioning of the phrase and its conjunction with
the earlier wording of section 2(1) suggest to me, as they did to Waller and
May LJJ, that by speaking of a “relationship” the legislature envisaged a close
link to the relevant obligation or right. A relationship cannot on any view
arise from or be created by simple ministerial decision that it would be good
policy or convenient to have domestically a scheme paralleling or extending EU
obligations in a field outside any covered by the EU obligations. That would be
to treat paragraph (b) as authorising a purpose to implement policy decisions
not involving the implementation of, not arising out of and unrelated to any EU
obligation.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A fifth and final point is that it is, in the light of the above,
possible to describe section 2(2) as both wide and confined in scope. It is
wide because it authorises almost every conceivable provision required to
fulfil the United Kingdom’s obligations under article 4.3 TEU (or to give
effect to any EU right) subject only to the restrictions in Schedule 2. It is
confined because any such provision must be for the purpose of implementing, or
dealing with a matter arising from or related to, such an obligation or right.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some conclusions can fairly readily be drawn. Consistently with a view
taken, I understand, by all members of the court in <i>Oakley</i>, it is clear,
that, where a Directive is in general terms leaving member states freedom to
decide on the precise means for its implementation, provisions which the United
Kingdom makes within the scope of such freedom will on the face of it fall
within section 2(2)(a), as being for the purpose of implementing or enabling
the implementation of the Directive. Second, where a Directive confers a choice
of specific alternatives, as Directive 98/59/EC did in article 1(1)(a) (see para
7 above) a provision selecting one or other alternative will also fall within
section 2(2)(a). Where a Directive gives member states a specific option to
derogate from its provisions in a particular respect - in <i>Oakley</i> as
regards design applications made prior to the date of domestic implementation
of the Directive and as regards resulting registrations – then I again agree
with the court in <i>Oakley </i>that the exercise of this option can be
regarded as falling within section 2(2)(a), and, further, that if that were not
so, then it would, in any event, be related to the implementation of the United
Kingdom’s EU obligation within section 2(2)(b).</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the other end of a spectrum is a situation such as Lord Hope
considered in <i>Risk Management</i>, para 24 (para 22 above). That is where a
Directive, such as Directive 2004/18/EC in that case, (i) addresses an internal
market competition issue, by introducing procedures for the award of public
works, supply and service contracts, but does not cover a situation where (ii)
public authorities contract inter se, or where (iii) a local authority
exercises over the other contracting party “a control which is similar to that
which it exercises over its own departments and, at the same time, that person
carries out the essential part of its activities with the controlling local
authority or authorities”: see <i>Teckal</i> (Case C-107/98) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1999/C10798.html">[1999] ECR I-8121</a>,
para 50. In that context, Lord Hope, with whose judgment three other members of
the court agreed, considered that it would not be a permitted use of the power
conferred by section 2(2) “to apply the public procurement rules to
relationships [such as those in (ii) and (iii)] that fell outside the regime
provided for by the Directive”: para 22 above. In agreement with Lord Hope, I
consider that, where a Directive is based on an internal market competence and
as a result limited in impact to internal market situations, its domestic
extension to situations outside the internal market cannot be regarded as being
within either section 2(2)(a) or (b) of the 1972 Act. This is so whether it is
so limited by implication or expressly.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>More difficult are intermediate situations where a Directive is limited
to, or specifically excludes, a particular area of the internal market. An example
of a Directive limited to a particular area of the internal market is Directive
2002/47/EC which was in issue in <i>Cukurova </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/2567.html">[2009] EuLR 317</a>. Directive
98/59/EC in issue in the present case is an example of a Directive with both
limitations and specific exclusions which appear to fall within the internal
market: It is limited by article 1(1)(a) to collective redundancies. It
excludes in article 1(2)(a) limited period contracts, which might affect the
functioning of the internal market competition. I say nothing on the question
whether the exclusion in article 1(2)(c) of the crews of seagoing vessels
operates in an area which might affect the internal market or was because this
was seen as a situation, like that covered by article 1(2)(b), where the internal
market was not affected.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, provisions extending an EU regime domestically into areas
not covered by or specifically excluded from the EU regime contemplated by a Directive
may well fall outside both paragraphs of section 2(2). Each case would have to
be considered on its own merits. Some adjustments to situations in which a Directive
operates may be regarded as necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
implementing or enabling the implementation of a Directive, or as being
“related to” the relevant EU obligation in the sense already discussed. <i>Pothecary
</i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2010/0158_09_2903.html">[2010] ICR 1008</a> is an example of a case where the Secretary of State used
section 2(2)(b) to provide for a reverse burden of proof in section 63A of the
Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as inserted by regulation 5 of the Indirect
Discrimination and Burden of Proof) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/2660) in cases of
alleged victimisation. There was no obligation under European law to have a
reverse burden in such cases. There was under the Burden of Proof Directive
97/80/EC an obligation to have a reverse burden in cases of alleged unequal
treatment, but the Employment Appeal Tribunal concluded that the right not to be
victimised did not form part of the principle of equal treatment, but was an
ancillary right accorded by EU law to render that principle properly
enforceable. On that basis, it held, unsurprisingly, that introducing a reverse
burden in respect of a right which European law treated as ancillary to its
prohibition of discrimination was dealing with a matter related to an EU obligation,
within section 2(2)(b).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Cukurova</i> Directive 2002/47/EC was expressly limited to
transactions between certain institutions, but the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) issued by HM Treasury
implementing it extended the range of the regime to cover other institutions.
Moses LJ was concerned with a question whether Cukurova should be allowed an
extension of time within which to challenge the vires of the Regulations.
Ultimately, all he did was express such “considerable doubts” about Cukurova’s
prospects of success in its challenge as to lead him to a conclusion that
justice did not demand an extension of time. Nonetheless, it is worth looking
at the case more closely, because in my view Moses LJ greatly underestimated
the force of Cukurova’s challenge.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 1(1) of Directive 2002/47/EC stated that it “lays down a
Community regime applicable to financial collateral arrangements [defined by
article 2.1(a) as meaning a “title transfer financial” or a “security financial”
collateral arrangement] which satisfy the requirements set out in paragraphs 2
and 5 and to financial collateral in accordance with the conditions set out in
paragraphs 4 and 5”. Paragraph 2 stated that “The collateral taker and the
collateral provider must each belong to one of the following categories”. These
included a wide range of (a) public authorities or bodies, (b) central or
development banks, (c) financial institutions subject to prudential
supervisions and (d) central counterparties, settlement agents or clearing
houses as well as (e) “a person other than a natural person, including
unincorporated firms and partnerships, provided that the other party is an
institution as defined in points (a) to (d)”. By these categories, the
Directive notably did not cover hedge funds. Paragraph 3 permitted member
states to “exclude from the scope of this Directive financial collateral
arrangements where one of the parties is a person mentioned in paragraph 2(e)”.
Recital 22 stated the objective of the Directive to be “to create a minimum
regime relating to the use of financial collateral”, this being an objective
which, it went on, “cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and
can therefore … be better achieved at Community level ...”.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In place of the carefully delineated categories of institution and
concern covered by the Directive, the 2003 Regulations put in place a regime
covering title transfer financial collateral arrangements and security
financial collateral arrangements where “the collateral-provider and the
collateral-taker are both non-natural persons”: regulation 3. I find it
difficult to see how this could be regarded as having been for the purpose of
implementing or enabling the implementation of the EU Directive. Equally, the
extension did not arise out of the obligations in the Directive and was not
related to them. It was on its face the product of a decision by HM Treasury
that it would be good policy domestically to have a more extensive regime
operate within the United Kingdom. That is something which was of course open
to the United Kingdom under European law, since the Directive was a measure of
minimum harmonisation. But it was under the United Kingdom constitution and the
1972 Act a matter which was not for the executive to decide, but for Parliament
to consider and, it if thought fit, to agree as a matter of primary
legislation.</a></p><a name="para69">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Returning to the present case, it falls in my view even more clearly
within the category which Lord Hope was considering in <i>Risk Management</i>.
It also concerns a Directive issued by the European legislature under its
internal market competence, which in the present case specifically excludes by
article 1(2)(b) situations outside that competence. The express liberty in
article 5 for member states to make provisions more favourable to workers does
not in my view lead or point to a contrary view. It cannot have been directed
to matters which would be outside the European Union’s internal market
competence. Even in relation to matters within the Union’s internal market
competence, an article of this nature does no more on its face than confirm
that the Directive is a minimum harmonisation measure, which leaves member
states free to introduce more favourable provisions as a matter of domestic
law. This does not mean that such provisions are necessarily to be regarded as
dealing with matters related to any EU obligation or rights.</a></p><a name="para70">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that, had the provisions of TULCRA in its unamended form been
the product of subordinate legislation under section 2(2) of the 1972, they
would, on Lord Hope’s analysis, have been ultra vires at least in so far as
they purported to extend the required procedure for dismissals involving
redundancies to situations falling within article 1(2)(b) of Directive
98/59/EC. However, TULCRA in its unamended form was actually a piece of primary
legislation. So far as Parliament chose by TULCRA in its unamended form to
extend the required procedure for dismissals involving redundancies, it was
fully entitled to do so. Parliament has no need to show any particular
competence base for primary legislation. It can legislate at will and at the
same time achieve both European Union aims and domestic aims, as long as the
latter are not positively inconsistent with the former. But TULCRA in its
unamended form was confined to situations where the relevant employees had
trade union representation. When the executive chose to rectify this by using
section 2(2) of the 1972 Act to cover situations where there was no trade union
representation, it did so across the whole width of the previous legislation -
so as to affect not only situations within the internal market scope of
Directive 98/59/EC, but also the domestic situations to which Parliament had
also extended the required procedure for dismissals. If Lord Hope’s analysis is
correct, does this mean that the amendments to TULCRA by the 1995 Regulations
must to that extent be regarded as ultra vires?</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have found this a difficult and borderline question to answer.
Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that it can and should be answered in
the negative. TULCRA in its unamended form represented a unified domestic
regime. The Court of Justice in 1994 identified a flaw in the protection
provided, in that it did not cater for non-trade union situations. It is
entirely unsurprising that the 1995 Regulations did not distinguish between parts
of TULCRA which were and were not within the internal market competence or
within article 1(2)(b) of the Directive. I think that, in these unusual
circumstances, Parliament can, by enacting TULCRA in its unamended form, be
regarded as having created, for the future domestic purposes of the 1972 Act, a
relationship between the EU obligation (which it was a primary object of Part
IV Chapter II of TULCRA in its unamended form to implement) and the categories
of public employment falling within article 1(2)(b) of Directive 98/59/EC
(which Parliament decided without any EU obligation to do so to cover by TULCRA
in its unamended form). That relationship having been established by TULCRA in
its unamended form, it seems to me that the executive was entitled to take it
into account and to continue it by and in the 1995 Regulations.</a></p><a name="para72">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This case has an unfortunate procedural background, which has been
described by Lord Mance. Among other grounds raised by the appellants (which in
agreement with my colleagues I would dismiss), it raises two difficult issues
at the interface between European and domestic law: first, the extent of the
power conferred by section 2(2)(b) of the European Communities Act 1972 to
legislate in the UK by statutory instrument on matters “arising out of or
related to” obligations under European law; secondly, the approach of the
domestic court to an issue of European law (“the <i>Fujitsu </i>issue” – see
below) which arises under a UK statute modelled on a European Directive, but
which has been held to be outside the competence of the European court. As will
be seen, the two are in my view linked. Unfortunately, only the first is before
this court on the present appeal. The second will have to be determined by the
Court of Appeal if the present appeal fails, and may return here at a later
date.</a></p><a name="para74">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is the further difficulty that neither of the parties to the
appeal has more than a limited interest in the resolution of either issue as a
matter of law. The United States of America, as appellant, has no direct
interest in the resolution of issues of English or European law. It is only
before the court because it failed at an early stage (for understandable
reasons at the time) to claim sovereign state immunity. (It is common ground
that if a claim to state immunity had been made at the outset it would have
succeeded.) Mrs Nolan, the nominal respondent, has not contested the appeal,
either in the Court of Appeal or in this court. The UK government, which might
be thought to have a substantial interest in both issues has chosen not to
intervene, though informed of the appeal.</a></p><a name="para75">

</span>As he has noted, an important event was the decision of the Employment
Appeal Tribunal, in <i>UK Coal Mining Ltd v National Union of Mineworkers</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0397_06_2709.html">[2008] ICR 163</a>), given in September 2007. To explain its importance I can refer
to Underhill LJ’s summary <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/71.html">[2014] ICR 685</a>, para 9:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The trend of English authority
until comparatively recently was to the effect that the collective redundancy
provisions, even when read with the Directive, did not oblige an employer to
consult about, or therefore disclose the reasons for, the underlying business
decision which gave rise to a proposed collective redundancy – the paradigm
case being the closure of a workplace – but only about the consequences of that
decision. ... However, the decision of the ECJ in <i>Junk v Kühnel</i> (Case C-188/03)
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C18803.html">[2005] ECR I-885</a>, raised a serious question whether that approach was
compatible with EU law. In <i>UK Coal Mining </i>…, the Employment Appeal Tribunal
(Elias J, President, presiding) declined explicitly to depart from the
established approach (while expressing some reservations about it); but it
nevertheless held that in a case where a decision to close a workplace and the
consequent decision to make redundancies were ‘inextricably interlinked’ the
obligation to consult about the reasons for the latter necessarily involved an
obligation to consult about the reasons for the former – and thus required the
employer to initiate consultations prior to the closure decision. The CJEU
revisited this issue in <i>Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto (AEK) ry v Fujitsu
Siemens Computers Oy</i> (Case C-44/08) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C4408.html">[2010] ICR 444</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C4408.html">[2009] ECR I-8163</a> (‘the
<i>Fujitsu</i> decision’); but unfortunately the effect of its reasoning is, to
put it no higher, not entirely clear.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Underhill LJ explained (para 10), this change of understanding had
important implications for the present case, in particular in the context of
the USA’s failure to rely before the tribunal on sovereign immunity:</a></p><a name="para80">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“On the approach which it had
initially taken, which involved acceptance of an obligation to consult only
about the consequences for employees of the closure of the base, there had been
no need for the USA to take any point on its status as a sovereign state. But
the approach espoused in the <i>UK Coal</i> case was unacceptable to it: it did
not believe that it should or could be under any legal obligation to consult
with employees about a decision to close a military base, which is an act done <i>jure
imperii</i>. …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">It was not until the remedy hearing that the USA sought for
the first time to invoke state immunity; but the tribunal held that it had
already submitted to the jurisdiction. That conclusion is not now in issue.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before the EAT Mr John Cavanagh QC, who represented the USA, argued, as
he has before us, that as a matter of construction, and in order to avoid
absurdity, section 188 should be read as excluding any obligation by a
sovereign state employer to consult about a decision made <i>jure imperii</i>. That
submission was rejected by both the EAT and the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para81">In the Court of Appeal he further submitted that in the
light of the <i>Fujitsu </i>decision, the reasoning in <i>UK Coal </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0397_06_2709.html">[2008] ICR 163</a><i> </i>should not be supported, with the consequence that consultation
on the business decision to close the base had not been required.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82">82.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the course of a detailed review of the reasoning of the Advocate
General and the CJEU in the <i>Fujitsu </i>case, Rimer LJ (giving the judgment
of the court) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1223.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 1223</a> sought an answer to what he identified as
the critical question:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… does the ECJ explain whether
the consultation obligation arises (i) when the employer is proposing, but has
not yet made, a strategic business or operational decision that will
foreseeably or inevitably lead to collective redundancies; or (ii) only when
that decision has actually been made and he is then proposing consequential
redundancies?” (para 57)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">He inclined to the view that the Advocate General had
favoured option (ii) (para 53). But he was unwilling to venture a concluded
view on the position of the court, which he considered unclear (para 59), and
which could be only resolved by the CJEU itself. Notwithstanding the “USA’s
express unwillingness” to support a reference, he saw it as important “not just
to the disposition of this litigation but also to industrial practice generally
…” (para 62).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83">83.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before the CJEU, as Lord Mance has noted, the case took an unexpected
turn. Prompted by observations of the Commission, the court invited submissions
on whether, having regard to the exclusion for public administrative bodies in
article 1(2)(b), the dismissal was outside the scope of the Directive, with the
result that the court would have no jurisdiction to decide the question. Its
answer (in its judgment of 18 October 2012, (Case C-583/10), </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C58310.html">[2013] ICR 193</a>)
was no (for reasons to which I shall return below). Accordingly, when the
appeal came back to the Court of Appeal, the issue had to be considered as one
of domestic law only.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84">84.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the second Court of Appeal hearing, the primary submission for the
USA was that, in order to achieve conformity with the Directive, words should
be read into section 188 to exclude its operation to a foreign state engaged in
the exercise of public powers. This was rejected by Underhill LJ (with whom the
other members of the court agreed). The draftsman had made a deliberate
decision not to extend the exclusion to all public administrative bodies. This
was unsurprising, given that “the concept of a special employment regime for
public employees recognised in some civil law countries has no equivalent in
the common law”, and it made sense for Parliament to have settled for “a
touchstone for exclusion which used common law concepts and would be
(comparatively) easy to apply in the United Kingdom”. He added that the Labour Government
in 1975 may have had policy reasons to extend the collective redundancy
provisions to public administrative bodies, such as local authorities, given
the influence at the time of public sector trade unions (para 24).</a></p><a name="para84">

</span>Having rejected the argument that amendments made under the European
Communities Act 1972 had been outside the powers conferred by the Act, he
concluded that there would need to be a further hearing to determine “the <i>Fujitsu</i>
issue”. It was regrettable but unavoidable that – </a></p><a name="para85">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… an issue which will in almost
all other cases – albeit not in this – depend on EU law will have to be decided
without the guidance of the CJEU…” (para 33)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">It was further ordered that in the event of an appeal to
the Supreme Court, the further hearing on the <i>Fujitsu</i> issue should await
the outcome of the appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The reasoning of the CJEU</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The European court held that the armed forces fell clearly within the
exception for public administration or equivalent bodies under article 1(2)(b).
This was also supported by the objectives of the Directive, concerned with “improving
the protection of workers and the functioning of the internal market” (para 39):</a></p><a name="para86">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the size and
functioning of the armed forces does have an influence on the employment
situation in a given member state, considerations concerning the internal
market or competition between undertakings do not apply to them. As the Court
of Justice has already held, activities which, like national defence, fall
within the exercise of public powers are in principle excluded from
classification as economic activity …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">It followed that dismissal of staff of a military base did
not fall within the scope of the Directive, “irrespective of whether or not it
is a military base belonging to a non-member state.” (para 43)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court also considered an argument that, even if the case fell
outside the Directive, it was able to give a preliminary ruling, following
cases in which the court had accepted jurisdiction where EU law had been
rendered applicable by reference in domestic law. The court explained the
limits of that principle:</a></p><a name="para87">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court has already
held that where, in regulating situations outside the scope of the EU measure
concerned, national legislation seeks to adopt the same solutions as those
adopted in that measure, it is clearly in the interest of the European Union
that, in order to forestall future differences of interpretation, provisions
taken from that measure should be interpreted uniformly …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, an interpretation
by the court of provisions of EU law in situations outside its scope is
justified where those provisions have been made applicable to such situations
by national law in a direct and unconditional way in order to ensure that
internal situations and situations governed by EU law are treated in the same
way …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the court noted, in paras 49 and 50, that the USA had had the
opportunity in the tribunal to rely on state immunity, or on “special
circumstances” under section 188(7). It followed that the court did not have
“sufficiently precise indications” that the national law made the solutions
adopted by the Directive “automatically applicable” in such a case (para 51),
so as to make the provisions of the Directive applicable “in a direct and unconditional
way” (para 52). The court continued:</a></p><a name="para88">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that it is in
the interests of the Union to safeguard the uniformity of the interpretations
of a provision of an EU measure and those of national law which transpose it
and make it applicable outside the scope of that measure.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">54.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, such is not the
case where, as in the case in the main proceedings, an EU measure expressly
provides a case of exclusion from its scope.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the EU legislature
states unequivocally that the measure which it has adopted does not apply to a
precise area, it renounces, at least until the adoption of possible new EU
rules, the objective seeking uniform interpretation and application of the rules
of law in that excluded area.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it cannot be stated
or presumed that there was an interest of the Union that, in an area excluded
by the EU legislature from the scope of the measure which it adopted, there
should be a uniform interpretation of the provisions of that measure.”</p>

</span>The scope of section 2(2)(b) was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>Oakley
Inc v Animal Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1191.html">[2005] EWCA Civ 1191</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1191.html">[2006] Ch 337</a>. The Registered Design
Regulations 2001 were made under section 2(2) in order to implement Directive
98/71/EC, concerning the approximation of laws relating to registered designs.
Article 11(8) was a transitional provision which granted member states the
option of retaining their old laws in relation to designs that were already
registered. The Court of Appeal rejected an argument that the transitional
provisions in the Regulations went further than permitted by the Directive. Of
section 2(2)(b) Waller LJ said that the words “arising out of” and “related to”
should be read in the context of section 2 itself, the primary purpose of which
was to give effect to the laws which under the EU Treaties the United Kingdom
had agreed to make part of its own laws. He observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It seems to me that section
2(2)(b) from its position in section 2, from the fact that it adds something to
both subsections (1) and (2), and from its very wording is a subsection to
enable further measures to be taken which <i>naturally arise from or closely
relate to</i> the primary purpose being achieved.” (para 39) (emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">May LJ contrasted sections 2(2)(a) and (b):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is a distinction between
providing something which, although it is a choice, is a choice which the
implementation of the Directive requires you to make, and one which is not so
required, but which has the effect <i>of tidying things up or making closely
related original choices</i> which the Directive does not necessarily require.
Section 2(2)(b) is confined by its words and context ….” (para 47) (emphasis

</span>In the present case the Court of Appeal accepted that the 1995 Regulations
were not within the scope of section 2(2)(a) of the 1972 Act, but held that they
were authorised by section 2(2)(b). Underhill LJ said:</a></p><a name="para90">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The decision to go beyond the
requirements of the Directive by extending the ‘employee representative’ rights
to employees in PABs (except those in Crown employment) may, as a matter of
strict analysis, reflect a substantive policy choice made by the Secretary of
State; but, as the judgments in the <i>Oakley Inc </i>case make clear, that is
not in itself objectionable. In fact all that he was doing was plugging the
rights created by the Regulations in cases where no trade union was recognised
into the pre-existing scheme of the Act and thereby reproducing, in the case of
this late-discovered lacuna in the implementation of the Directive, the selfsame
decision as Parliament had already made in enacting the primary legislation in
1975 and 1992. It would indeed have been an extraordinary anomaly if the kinds
of employment where the obligation to consult arose differed as between cases
where a trade union was recognised and cases where it was not; and it was not
only natural but right for the Secretary of State in making the 1995 Regulations
to ensure that the position was the same in both cases. In my judgment this is
precisely the kind of ‘closely related original choice which the Directive does
not … require’ but which ‘has the effect of tidying things up’ that May LJ
identifies in his judgment in <i>Oakley Inc</i> case.” (para 32)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court, Mr Beloff QC supports the reasoning of the Court of Appeal.
Article 5 of the Directive made clear that the Directive sought to achieve minimum
harmonisation only. Member states were free to enact laws more favourable to
workers than those required by the Directive. Section 188, as applied to public
administrative bodies, “arose out” of the obligations under the Directive in
the sense of extending them further, as the UK was entitled to do by article 5,
or alternatively it “related to” those because the subject matter (the right to
consultation) was identical to the right to be consulted in the Directive. By
the same token, the 1995 Regulations, in filling a gap in the UK legislation
identified by the European court in <i>Commission of the European Communities v
United Kingdom</i> (Case C-383/92) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1994/C38292.html">[1994] ICR 664</a> fell squarely within the
scope of section 2(2)(b) of the 1972 Act under which they were made.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92">92.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This reasoning is challenged by Mr Cavanagh QC. Mrs Nolan’s employment
by the public employers such as the USA was not within the scope of the 1992
Act as enacted by Parliament. It was brought within it solely by the amendments
made by the 1995 Regulations. The Court of Appeal were right to find that the Regulations
were outside the scope of section 2(2)(a), but were wrong to find that they
were within section 2(2)(b) as matters “arising out of or related to” a
community obligation. The CJEU judgment in the present case has made clear that
decisions relating to the closure of foreign military bases are within “an area
excluded by the EU legislature from the scope of the measure which it adopted”
(judgment para 56). It follows that, in so far as the 1995 Regulations
purported to extend the application of section 188 to employee representatives
in such cases, they had nothing to do with this country’s Community obligations,
but arose solely from domestic policy considerations. They were not dealing
with matters “arising out of or related to” EU obligations in any relevant
sense.</a></p><a name="para92">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is true that section 2(2) of
the European Communities Act 1972 is in wide terms. It does not confine any
measures made under it to doing the minimum necessary to give effect to a
Directive. But, if it is to be within the powers of the subsection, the measure
has to arise out of or be related to an EU obligation. As Waller LJ said in <i>Oakley
Inc v Animal Ltd</i> …, the primary objective of any secondary legislation
under section 2(2) must be to bring into force laws which, under the Treaties,
the United Kingdom has agreed to make part of its laws …”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The words “related to” in section 2(2)(b) taken out of context are so
wide as to be almost meaningless. A “relationship” may be very close or very
distant without distortion of the word. In one sense, as Mr Beloff QC appeared
to suggest, any provision dealing with employees’ rights to consultation could
be said to be “related to” the subject-matter of this Directive, and hence
within the scope of the section. More specifically, it may be said in the
present context, Parliament has in the 1992 Act established a clear and direct
relationship, as a matter of domestic law, between the employments covered by
the Directive, and the extension to equivalent employments under public
administrative bodies. If that were sufficient, then it would no doubt follow
that, when legislative action was required to fill gaps in the transposition of
the Directive into domestic law, the same “relationship” would cover the
decision to take equivalent action in respect of the extension.</a></p><a name="para94">

</span>In <i>Oakley </i>the Court of Appeal sought to avoid an unduly broad
interpretation by introducing additional qualifications: “naturally arising”,
“closely related”, “tidying up”. Such glosses are not justified by normal rules
of interpretation, and may beg as many questions as they solve. Thus in the
present case, it may be said that extending the 1995 Regulations to public
administrative bodies is “closely related to” to the main purpose of the
amendments, or (as Underhill LJ thought) simply a matter of “tidying up” the
1992 Act in the light of the European court’s decision. Such language provides
no answer to the underlying problem that the relationship is one created
entirely by a domestic statute, and has no obvious relevance to the purpose of
the 1972 Act.</a></p><a name="para95">

relationship must be one relevant to the purpose of the legislation, that is to
give effect to the UK’s obligations in European law. In other words it must be
a relationship derived in some way from European law, not one dictated solely
by considerations of domestic law. On the other hand, as the language makes
clear, the power is not confined to matters which arise directly from the
European obligation – the “minimum necessary” in Lord Hope’s words, at para 24.
“Related to” implies the possibility of a less direct connection.</p>

</span>The interpretation of the 1972 Act is of course a matter ultimately for
the domestic, not the European courts. However, the reasoning of the CJEU in
the present case suggests the basis for a principled and workable distinction,
corresponding to the limits of its own jurisdiction. This would have the
additional advantage of avoiding the problem, noted by Underhill LJ, of a
European question of general importance (the <i>Fujitsu </i>issue) having to be
decided without the possibility of recourse to the European court. The court
saw its jurisdiction as extending to cases where European provisions are made
applicable by national law “in a direct and unconditional way” to internal
situations outside their direct scope. A relationship adequate to give
jurisdiction to the European court might be thought an adequate relationship
also for the purpose of the 1972 Act. However, that solution is not available
in this case. The effect of article 1(2)(b), as found by the court, is to
exclude public administrative bodies entirely from the scope of the Directive,
and to “renounce” any European interest in that excluded area.</a></p><a name="para97">

</span>I note with respect the different view taken by Lord Mance on what he
describes as a difficult and borderline question. As I understand his judgment (para
71), he might have reached a different conclusion, if TULCRA in its amended
form had been the product of subordinate rather than primary legislation. I
would only comment that I find it difficult to understand why the status of the
original legislation should impinge materially on the “relationship” required
by section 2(2)(b) to support the 1995 Regulations.</a></p><a name="para98">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Beloff QC relies on article 5 of the Directive by which member states
are permitted to introduce laws or other measures which are “more favourable to
workers …”. Although the CJEU did not refer in terms to article 5, its
reasoning makes it difficult to see the present extension as coming within its
scope. That allows terms more favourable to “workers” as defined in the
Directive. But by article 1.2(b), as interpreted by the CJEU, the Directive has
no application to workers in public administrative bodies, who are outside its
scope altogether and hence outside the reach of article 5. The power of the
national legislature to extend similar protection to such workers is a matter
purely of domestic competence, and owes nothing to the Directive. I should add
that the same reasoning does not necessarily apply to time-limited contracts,
which, as already noted, are excluded by article 1(2)(a) of the Directive, but
not from the domestic legislation. Employees under such contracts may still be
“workers” for the purposes of the Directive, and therefore potentially within
the scope of article 5.</a></p><a name="para99">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I find it difficult therefore to avoid the conclusion that the extension
of the 1995 Regulations to public administrative bodies, such as the
appellants, was not within the power conferred by the 1972 Act, and that the
appeal should be allowed on this ground. I reach this position with some diffidence,
given that the wider implications of this interpretation of the 1972 Act have
not been explored, and we have had no submissions from the UK government which
is primarily interested in those issues. As already indicated, before reaching
a final decision, I would have wished to invite the UK government to make
representations on this issue. That will not now be necessary, in view of the
opposite conclusion reached by Lord Mance, with the agreement of the rest of
the court. I regret that, because of the narrow basis on which the appeal has
come before us, we have not been able to provide any assistance on the
resolution, as a matter now of domestic law, of the difficult <i>Fujitsu </i>issue,
which, unless the parties otherwise agree, will have to revert to the Court of
Appeal.</a></p><a name="para100">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, I would have allowed the appeal on the vires issue,
but dismissed all the other grounds of appeal.</a></p><a name="para101">
