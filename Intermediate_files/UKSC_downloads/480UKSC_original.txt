</span>Mr Patrick McKenna is a former senior partner of a global firm of
chartered accountants. He is the founder and chief executive officer of
Ingenious Media Holdings plc. The company and its subsidiaries (collectively
“Ingenious Media”) are an investment and advisory group specialising in the
media and entertainment industries. Among other things they have promoted film
investment schemes involving film production partnerships. The schemes were
devised by Mr McKenna and utilised certain tax relief which was then available.
The marketing of the schemes stopped when the tax relief ceased to be

</span>On 21 June 2012 <i>The Times </i>published two articles on the subject
of film schemes and tax avoidance. They informed readers that:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Patrick McKenna … and … [X] … are

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">To the Revenue the two men

Hartnett was the source of the reference to £5 billion (although in the interview
Mr Hartnett gave the figure “utterly off the record”). Mr Hartnett said other
things which were not for quotation (and were not quoted), including a
description of the film schemes as “scams for scumbags”. At the time of the

</span>The reasons given by Mr Hartnett for what he said to the journalists
about Mr McKenna and Ingenious were that it was generally in HMRC’s interests
to try to establish good relations with the financial press; that they provided
a way of emphasising to the general public HMRC’s views on elaborate tax
avoidance schemes; and that Mr Hartnett thought that the journalists might have
information of significant value to HMRC, which they might reveal as the
dialogue continued, such as details of tax avoidance arrangements which the
journalists had uncovered but were unknown to HMRC. Mr Hartnett emphasised that
the interview was agreed to be off the record, and that he did not anticipate
that his comments about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media would be published.</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="ParaHeading">The claim</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claim by Ingenious Media and Mr McKenna was brought by way of an
application for judicial review, although in substance it was a straightforward
claim for breach of a duty of confidentiality. The form in which the claim was
brought appears to have influenced its perception by the courts below. At first
instance, Sales J held that it was not appropriate for the court to approach Mr
Hartnett’s decision to say what he said as if the court were the primary
decision-maker: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/3258.html">[2013] EWHC 3258 (Admin)</a>, para 40. The court, he held, could
only intervene if satisfied that Mr Hartnett could not rationally take the view
that speaking to the journalists as he did would assist HMRC in the exercise of
its tax collection functions. Sales J emphasised, at para 50, that the
rationality standard is a flexible one, which varies in the width of discretion
allowed to a decision-maker according to the strength of the public interest
and the strength of the interests of any individual affected by the decision to
be taken. He laid stress on the fact that the disclosures made were limited and
that the interview was agreed to be off the record. The disclosures made were,
in his judgment, not irrational, were made for a legitimate purpose and were
proportionate. In short, he approached the matter as a review on public law
principles of an administrative act, and he dismissed the claim.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sales J’s judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a judgment given
by Sir Robin Jacob, with which Moore-Bick and Tomlinson LJJ agreed: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/173.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3183</a>. Sir Robin rejected the claimants’ arguments that the disclosures made
were not “in connection with a function” of HMRC, properly construed, and that
the judge had adopted the wrong standard of review. As to the first argument,
he held that a wide meaning should be given to section 18(2)(a)(i) (“…
subsection (1) does not apply to a disclosure which is made for the purposes of
a function of the Revenue and Customs”). As to the second argument, Sir Robin
echoed Sales J’s holding that it was not for the court to “review all the facts
de novo as though it were the primary decision maker” (para 46).</p>

</span>From the judgments below and the arguments in this court, three main
issues emerge: what is the proper construction of the section 18(2)(a)(i) read

understanding that his interview with the journalists was to be off the record?</a></p><a name="para16">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately the courts below were not referred (or were only scarcely
referred) to the common law of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality
owed by HMRC to individual taxpayers is not something which sprang fresh from
the mind of the legislative drafter. It is a well established principle of the
law of confidentiality that where information of a personal or confidential
nature is obtained or received in the exercise of a legal power or in
furtherance of a public duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the
person from whom it was received or to whom it relates not to use it for other
purposes. The principle is sometimes referred to as the <i>Marcel</i>
principle, after <i>Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [1992]
Ch 225. In relation to taxpayers, HMRC’s entitlement to receive and hold
confidential information about a person or a company’s financial affairs is for
the purpose of enabling it to assess and collect (or pay) what is properly due
from (or to) the tax payer. In <i>R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p National
Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/TC_55_133.html">[1982] AC 617</a>, 633,
Lord Wilberforce said that “the whole system … involves that … matters relating
to income tax are between the commissioners and the taxpayer concerned”, and
that the “total confidentiality of assessments and of negotiations between
individuals and the revenue is a vital element in the working of the system”.

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <i>Marcel</i> principle may be overridden by explicit statutory
provisions. In <i>In re Arrows Ltd (No 4)</i> [1995] 2 AC 75, 102, Lord
Browne-Wilkinson said:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my view, where information has
been obtained under statutory powers the duty of confidence owed on the <i>Marcel</i>
principle cannot operate so as to prevent the person obtaining the information
from disclosing it to those persons to whom the statutory provisions either
require or authorise him to make disclosure.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subsections (2)(b) et seq of section 18 contain specific provisions
permitting the disclosure of taxpayer information for various purposes other
than HMRC’s primary function of revenue collection and management. What then is
the proper interpretation of the far broader words of subsection (2)(a)(i)
“disclosure … made for the purposes of a function” of HMRC? On HMRC’s
interpretation, it would be hard to conceive a wider expression. By taking
sections 5, 9 and 51(2) in combination, it is said to include anything which in
the view of HMRC is necessary <i>or</i> expedient <i>or </i>incidental <i>or</i>
conducive to <i>or</i> in connection with the exercise of the functions of the
collection and management of revenue. If that is the right interpretation of
subsection (2)(a)(i), it means that a number of the subsequently listed
specific exceptions are otiose, including (c) and (d), which deal with
disclosure for the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings relating to
matters connected with customs and excise. Secondly, and more fundamentally, it
means that the protection which would otherwise have been provided to the
taxpayer by HMRC’s duty of confidentiality will have been very significantly
eroded by words of the utmost vagueness.&nbsp; So to construe the words would run
counter to the principle of construction known as the principle of legality,
after Lord Hoffmann’s use of the term in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home
Office, Ex p Simms</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html">[2000] 2 AC 115</a>, 131. He explained the principle as
follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Fundamental rights cannot be
overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a
risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed
unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or
necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even
the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the
individual.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann said that this presumption will apply “even” to the most
general words, but I would say further that the more general the words, the
harder it is likely to be to rebut the presumption.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A similar principle can be seen in the courts’ approach to the
interpretation of powers delegated under a so-called Henry VIII clause. In <i>R
(Public Law Project) v Lord Chancellor</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/39.html">[2016] 3 WLR 387</a>, para 26, Lord
Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC, with the agreement of the other members of the
court, cited with approval the following passage in <i>Craies on Legislation</i>,
10th ed (2012), edited by Daniel Greenberg, at para 1.3.11:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“as with all delegated powers the
only rule for construction is to test each proposed exercise by reference to
whether or not it is within the class of action that Parliament must have
contemplated when delegating. Although Henry VIII powers are often cast in very
wide terms, <i>the more general the words used by Parliament to delegate a
power, the more likely it is that an exercise within the literal meaning of the
words will nevertheless be outside the legislature’s contemplation</i>.”
(Emphasis added)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To take the present case, the general principle of HMRC’s duty of
confidentiality regarding individual tax payers’ affairs is long established. (In
2011 Mr Hartnett articulated it when refusing to give any information to the
House of Commons Public Accounts Committee about tax payers with whom HMRC had
reached settlements.) In passing the 2005 Act, Parliament cannot be supposed to
have envisaged that by section 18(2)(a)(i) it was authorising HMRC officials to
discuss its views of individual taxpayers in off the record discussions,
whenever officials thought that this would be expedient for some collateral
purpose connected with its functions, such as developing HMRC’s relations with
the press. If Parliament really intended to delegate to officials such a wide
discretion, limited only by a rationality test, in place of the ordinary
principles of confidentiality applicable to public bodies in respect of
confidential or private information obtained under statutory powers or for a
statutory purpose, it would have significantly emasculated the primary duty of
confidentiality recognised in section 18(1).</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For those reasons section 18(2)(a)(i) requires to be interpreted more
narrowly. I take section 18(1) to be intended to reflect the ordinary principle
of taxpayer confidentiality referred to in<i> </i>para 17, to which section
18(2)(a)(i) creates an exception by permitting disclosure to the extent
reasonably necessary for HMRC to fulfil its primary function.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was argued by HMRC that despite being headed “Confidentiality”,
section 18 is not confined to information which is in any real sense
confidential, but is far wider in its scope. Therefore, it was argued, the
exception contained in subsection (2)(a)(i) must be given a similarly expansive
interpretation in order to avoid absurdity. In support of this argument HMRC
relied on the wording of section 19, which makes it a criminal offence for an
official to disclose revenue or customs information relating to an identifiable
person, but provides a defence if the person charged proves that he reasonably
believed that “the information had already and lawfully been made available to
the public”. The creation of this defence showed, in HMRC’s submission, that
section 18 was not essentially or only about protecting confidentiality,
because it self-evidently extended to the disclosure of information which was
already in the public domain.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This argument found favour with the Court of Appeal, but I do not
consider that it bears the weight which HMRC seeks to put on it. The argument
is too subtle, and it is open to other objections. It is well settled that
information may be available to the public and yet not sufficiently widely
known for all confidentiality in it to be destroyed. As Eady J put it in <i>McKennitt
v Ash</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2005/3003.html">[2006] EMLR 10</a>, para 81, where information has been obtained in
circumstances giving rise to a duty of confidentiality, “the protection of the
law will not be withdrawn unless and until it is clear that a stage has been
reached where there is no longer anything left to be protected”. Whether that
stage has been reached may be a hard question on which reasonable people may
disagree. It is a fallacy to suppose that because a defence to a criminal
charge under section 19 is available to a person who reasonably believed the
information to be available to the public, it must follow that Parliament
intended section 18 to prohibit the disclosure of information of the most
ordinary kind about which there could be no possible confidentiality. Moreover,
even if section 18(1) has the wide scope suggested by HMRC (which it is not
necessary to decide in this case), it does not follow that Parliament must be
taken to have intended by subsection (2)(a)(i) to confer on officials a wide
ranging discretion to disclose confidential information about the affairs of
individual taxpayers.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The court’s approach to review of HMRC’s conduct</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ordinarily it is a matter for the court to decide the question whether
there has been a breach of a duty of confidentiality, applying established
principles of law to its own judgment of the facts. Among other authorities,
the point is well illustrated by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>W v
Egdell</i> [1990] 1 Ch 359. The plaintiff was detained in a secure mental
hospital, under a hospital order coupled with a restriction order, after
pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The defendant, a consultant psychiatrist, was engaged on his behalf to prepare
a report in connection with an intended application to a mental health review
tribunal for his discharge. The defendant’s report presented a disturbing
picture and it led to the withdrawal of the application. The defendant was
nevertheless so concerned that matters in his report ought to be known to those
responsible for the plaintiff’s care and discharge that he sent a copy of it to
the medical director at the hospital, with a view to its onward transmission to
the Home Office. The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of his contractual
duty of confidence. Dismissing the action, the trial judge held that the
doctor’s duty of confidentiality did not bar him from disclosing the report to
the hospital if the doctor judged the report to be relevant to his care, nor
from disclosing it to the Home Secretary if the doctor judged the report to be
relevant to the exercise of the Home Secretary’s discretionary powers. The
Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision but not his approach. Bingham LJ
said, at p 422, that the answer to the question whether the doctor’s disclosure
was justified “must turn not on what the doctor thinks but on what the court
rules”. He added that it did not follow that the doctor’s conclusion was
irrelevant; in making its ruling the court would give such weight to the
doctor’s considered judgment as seemed in all the circumstances to be
appropriate.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same principle applies whether or not the duty of confidentiality is
contractual. It applies equally where the person or body owing a duty of
confidentiality holds a public office or is a public body or is performing a
public function, subject to any contrary statutory provision.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a cardinal error to suppose that the public law remedies and
principles associated with judicial review of the exercise of administrative
power, developed by the common law from the ancient prerogative writs, occupy
the entire field whenever the party whose conduct is under challenge holds a
public position. It is important to emphasise that public bodies are not immune
from the ordinary application of the common law, including in this case the law
of confidentiality. The common law is multi-faceted and remains the bedrock of
the English legal system.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having rejected the view that section 18(2)(a)(i) should be interpreted
as making the disclosure of information about individual taxpayers a matter for
the discretion of HMRC officials, subject only to a rationality control, I
disagree with the view of the lower courts that it was not for them to approach
the disclosures made by Mr Hartnett as if they were primary decision makers. In
accordance with ordinary principles, the question of breach of confidentiality
is one for the court’s judgment.</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="ParaHeading">“Off the record”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Off the record” is an idiom and like many idioms can bear different
shades of meaning. It may, for example, be intended to mean “strictly confidential”
or it may be intended to mean “not to be directly quoted or attributed”. The
judge found that Mr Hartnett understood it to mean that the interview was to be
a “background briefing”, intended to influence the journalists’ views and what
they wrote about matters affecting HMRC but not to be published. There has been
no appeal against that finding, but nothing in my view turns on what precisely
Mr Hartnett intended.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of principle, a disclosure of confidential information may
sometimes be permissible on a restricted basis. (In the case of <i>W v Egdell</i>,
previously cited, the doctor was lawfully justified in passing on his report to
those who had responsibility for the plaintiff’s care, whereas it would not
have been lawful to pass it to someone who had no such responsibility.) But an
impermissible disclosure of confidential information is no less impermissible
just because the information is passed on in confidence; every schoolchild
knows that this is how secrets get passed on. The references by the courts
below to the nature of the interview leave me in some doubt whether they had a
clear regard for the distinction.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The information supplied by Mr Hartnett to the journalists about Mr
McKenna and Ingenious Media was information of a confidential nature, in
respect of which HMRC owed a duty of confidentiality to them under section
18(1). It was limited in scope, but it was not insignificant, as is evident
from the use made of it in the articles which followed the interview.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time of the interview the tax consequences of the film schemes
discussed in it were under consideration by HMRC. The schemes themselves were
things of the past. It is not suggested that the disclosures made by Mr
Hartnett were reasonably necessary for the purpose of HMRC’s investigations
into the schemes.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the justifications put forward by HMRC, a general desire to foster
good relations with the media or to publicise HMRC’s views about elaborate tax
avoidance schemes cannot possibly justify a senior or any other official of
HMRC discussing the affairs of individual tax payers with journalists. The
further suggestion that the conversation might have led to the journalists
telling Mr Hartnett about other tax avoidance schemes, of which HMRC knew
nothing, appears to have been no more than speculation, and is far too tenuous
to justify giving confidential information to them.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported
is in itself no justification for making them. The whole idea of HMRC officials
supplying confidential information about individuals to the media on a
non-attributable basis is, or should be, a matter of serious concern. I would
not seek to lay down a rule that it can never be justified, because “never say
never” is a generally sound maxim. It is possible, for example, to imagine a
case where HMRC officials might be engaged in an anti-smuggling operation which
might be in danger of being wrecked by journalistic investigations and where
for operational reasons HMRC might judge it necessary to take the press into
its confidence, but such cases should be exceptional.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would reject the argument that the disclosure was justified under
section 18(2)(a), allow the appeal and invite the parties’ written submissions
as to the appropriate form of order.</a></p><a name="para36">
