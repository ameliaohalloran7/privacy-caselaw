</span>In circumstances in which at the time of a divorce a spouse, say a wife,
is awarded capital which enables her to purchase a home but later she exhausts
the capital by entry into a series of unwise transactions and so develops a
need to pay rent, is the court entitled to decline to increase the order for
the husband to make periodical payments to her so as to fund payment of all (or
perhaps even any) of her rent even if he could afford to do so?</a></p><a name="para1">

</span>Mr Mills (whom it will be convenient to describe as “the husband”
notwithstanding his divorce from Mrs Mills, “the wife”, in 2002) appeals
against an order for upwards variation of an order for periodical payments against
him in favour of the wife. The order for variation was made by the Court of
Appeal (Longmore LJ and Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President of Tribunals) on 1
February 2017: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/129.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 129</a>. By that order, the Court of Appeal allowed
the wife’s appeal against the dismissal of her application to vary the order
for periodical payments by Judge Everall QC (“the judge”) in the Central Family
Court in London on 9 June 2015.</p>

</span>The husband and wife are each aged 52. They were married in 1987. The
wife is a qualified beauty therapist. In the early years of the marriage she
worked, self-employed, in that capacity. The husband built up a surveying
business within two companies which he and the wife owned in equal shares. They
had one child, a son, now adult. In 1996 the wife unfortunately suffered a late
miscarriage, which precipitated a long period of painful gynaecological
difficulties for her. In 2000 the husband left the home in Guildford.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>On 7 June 2002, in the ensuing divorce proceedings, financial issues
were resolved within a consent order. In addition to provision for their son,
who was to continue to make his home with the wife and have contact with the
husband, the order provided that:</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>the home, vested in the joint names of the parties, should be sold;</p>

</span>its net proceeds should be divided in accordance with a formula which in
the event yielded £230,000 for the wife in settlement of all her capital claims
against the husband and £23,000 for him;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the wife should transfer to the husband her interest in policies worth
£23,000 and her shares in the surveying companies; and</p>

</span>the husband should make periodical payments to her at the annual rate of
£13,200 (not index-linked) on the open-ended basis, namely during their joint
lives until her remarriage or further order in the interim.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The wife therefore received the vast preponderance of the
parties’ liquid capital. The value of the two companies was not identified.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time of making the consent order the wife had represented that
ill-health was disabling her from working and that she would need £350,000 with
which to purchase a suitable home for herself and their son. The husband had
conceded that she then had no capacity to raise a mortgage but had suggested,
by contrast, that she could purchase a suitable home for £230,000 or less, in
other words free of mortgage. In the event, later in 2002, she proceeded to
purchase a house in Weybridge for £345,000 by deploying in effect her entire
share of the proceeds of the home and by raising the balance of £125,000 on
mortgage.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When he learnt of the wife’s purchase, the husband, by solicitors,
expressed surprise at its high cost and concern about her ability to service a
mortgage, let alone one of such size. By solicitors, she replied only that she
had not been able to secure reasonably priced accommodation in an area in which
it would in her opinion be best for their son to grow up.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that, by the time of her purchase of the house in Weybridge,
the wife had begun to work again as a beauty therapist, but part-time.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2006 the wife sold the house in Weybridge at the price for which she
had bought it, namely £345,000. But the sum owing on mortgage had risen by
£93,000 to £218,000. Having received written and oral evidence from the wife,
the judge found that she had been unable satisfactorily to explain why the sum
owing had increased or in what way the increase had been spent.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Upon the sale of the house in Weybridge the wife bought a flat in
Wimbledon for £323,000, with a deposit of £48,000 and a mortgage of £275,000. The
judge therefore calculated that, net of collateral costs of the transactions,
about £62,000 of the proceeds of sale had not been used in the purchase of the
flat; but he noted that the wife had refurbished it to some extent.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2007 the wife sold the flat in Wimbledon for £435,000. The sum then
owing on mortgage had risen only marginally, namely to £277,000. Instead she
bought a flat in Battersea for £520,000, with a deposit of £78,000 and a
mortgage of £442,000. The judge therefore calculated that, net of the
collateral costs, about £44,000 of the proceeds of sale had not been used in
the purchase of the second flat. It is unclear from his judgment how the wife
was able to secure, and then to service, a borrowing as high as £442,000.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2009 the wife sold the flat in Battersea for £580,000 and began to
rent accommodation. The judge calculated that, after repaying the mortgage of
£442,000 and meeting the collateral costs, the wife received about £120,000
from the proceeds of sale.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 2009 and 2015 the wife rented six successive properties in
London and Surrey.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By April 2015, when the judge heard the case, the wife had no capital. On
the contrary, she had overdrafts of £4,000, credit card liabilities of £18,000
and a tax liability of about £20,000.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before the judge were cross-applications. The husband had applied for
discharge of the order for periodical payments on his payment to the wife of a
modest capital sum, say of £26,000; or for a fixed period to be set on her
continued receipt of periodical payments and/or for a downwards variation of
their amount. The wife had cross-applied for an upwards variation of their
amount. Both applications were made under section 31(1) of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1973 (“the Act”). Section 31(7) provides:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In exercising the powers
conferred by this section the court shall have regard to all the circumstances
of the case, … [which] shall include any change in any of the matters to which
the court was required to have regard when making the order to which the
application relates, and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a
periodical payments ... order made on or after the grant of a decree of divorce
..., the court shall consider whether in all the circumstances and after having
regard to any such change it would be appropriate to vary the order so that
payments under the order are required to be made … only for such further period
as will in the opinion of the court be sufficient … to enable the party in
whose favour the order was made to adjust without undue hardship to the
termination of those payments;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt">…”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The “matters to which the court was required to have regard
when making the order” in 2002, even though it was made by consent, were those
set out in section 25(2) of the Act.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his judgment, which was reserved, the judge described the wife’s oral
evidence as not fully satisfactory. He explained that she had been unable to
give him a clear picture of her financial circumstances in the years since 2002;
that, apart from her failure to explain the dramatic increase in the size of
the mortgage on the house in Weybridge, she had been unable to identify the
size of her income from her part-time work in the earlier years, first as a
beauty therapist and then for an estate agent. He accepted that between 2004
and 2010 she had undergone no less than seven surgical procedures referable to
her gynaecological difficulties and that they had affected her earning capacity
at that time. He found, however, that she had exaggerated the continuing
impact, five years later, of those difficulties upon her earning capacity. In
2010 she had reverted to work as a beauty therapist. Her accounts for the last
available year, namely to April 2014, disclosed an annual income net of tax of
about £18,500. She had then been working about three days each week. The judge
rejected her contention that ill-health precluded her from working for a fourth
day but accepted that she might not be able to attract the extra clients to occupy
it. He therefore ascribed to her annual net earnings of only £18,500. The
husband contends that it was a somewhat conservative figure; but it is
appropriate for an appellate court to adopt it without qualification.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge found that the husband, by contrast, gave reliable and truthful
evidence in all respects. He had remarried and was living with his second wife,
their nine-year-old son and an adult step-daughter in a house in Guildford in
which, subject to a substantial mortgage, he had a half interest. As in 2002 he
had little liquid capital. The judge studied his earned income from the
surveying companies. They had suffered a reverse in 2012 but had slowly
recovered since then and, as the husband frankly conceded at the hearing, they
were likely to be thriving by 2025. The judge ascribed to the husband an
existing net annual income of £55,000 inclusive of a small salary which one of
the companies chose to pay to his current wife. It may again have been a
somewhat conservative figure; but it is again appropriate for an appellate
court to adopt it without qualification.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the hearing the wife’s then counsel put before the judge a breakdown
of what he suggested to be the amount of her necessary annual expenditure. The
judge accepted it as “very modest”. Exclusive of figures referable to the adult
son, the annual total was £35,792, of which £10,200 was for rent. Following
deduction of her earnings of £18,500, the wife’s annual need was therefore for
£17,292.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the judge’s decision was not to vary, whether upwards or downwards,
the existing order for periodical payments in the annual sum of £13,200. In
other words he countenanced a shortfall of £4,092 between the wife’s annual
need and the husband’s obligation to meet it. Why?</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer lies in the judge’s analysis of the wife’s loss of the
capital sum which had been awarded to her in 2002.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge found that:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the award in 2002 would then have enabled the wife to buy a home free of
mortgage;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>it had however been reasonable for her to be ambitious and to secure a mortgage
for the purchase of the house in Weybridge;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>thereafter she had not managed her finances wisely;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>like others at that time, she had committed herself to borrowings which
were too high;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>it would be wrong to describe her approach to finances as profligate or
wanton;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">vi)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>but her needs had been augmented by reason of the choices which she had
made.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the light of those findings the judge decided to reject the husband’s
submission that the wife’s need to pay rent of £10,200 should be entirely
eliminated from the total annual need which it would be appropriate for him to
meet. Nevertheless it was</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“fair that the husband’s
contribution to the wife’s needs should not include a full contribution to her
housing costs.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If, however arbitrarily, one omits to ascribe any part of the wife’s
earnings to the payment of rent of £10,200 and treats the rent as entirely
subsumed within her residual annual need of £17,292, it is easy to see that the
effect of the judge’s decision to countenance a shortfall from that figure of £4,092
was to oblige the husband to pay £6,108 towards the rent, or 60% of it.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the judge had described the wife’s schedule of annual needs
totalling £35,792 as “very modest” and indeed as “basic”, he said that the
husband’s contribution should do no more than to enable her to meet her “bare
minimum needs”, which, so he therefore implied, were properly to be reflected
in an even lower figure. “The wife”, he said, “will have to adjust her
expenditure to live within her means.”</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge found on clear evidence that the husband could afford to
continue to make periodical payments in the annual sum of £13,200. Indeed,
although there was no cause for him to make a finding to this effect, it also
seems reasonably clear that the husband could have afforded to pay the extra
annual sum of £4,092 if it had been otherwise appropriate to order him to do
so; it was certainly no part of the judge’s reasoning that the husband could
not have afforded to pay it.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In accordance with his duty the judge then turned to consider the
husband’s application for him to set a fixed period upon the wife’s continued
receipt of the periodical payments. But, applying section 31(7)(a) set out in
para 14 above, the judge concluded, unsurprisingly, that he could not identify
any fixed period as being sufficient to enable the wife to adjust without undue
hardship to their termination. It followed that the order should continue to
require them to be paid on the open-ended basis, namely during their joint
lives until her remarriage or further order in the interim. Although the
open-ended basis does not specify a fixed term for the life of the order, the
circumstances which it identifies as bringing it to an end, in particular the
potential for a further order ending it at any time, show how misleading
(indeed, as the husband himself says, how unattractive) it is for some
non-lawyers to describe such an order as a meal-ticket for life.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Inevitably the judge also concluded that any appropriate capitalisation
of periodical payments in that continuing sum and on that continuing basis
appeared to be beyond the husband’s means.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So the judge dismissed both the husband’s application and the wife’s
cross-application.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both the husband and the wife sought permission from the Court of Appeal
to appeal against the respective dismissals of their applications. The wife
secured permission to do so but, in circumstances which rendered him aggrieved
but are no longer relevant, the husband’s application for permission was not
granted likewise but was listed to be heard by the court at the time when it
was to hear the wife’s substantive appeal.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the conclusion of the hearing on 1 February 2017 Sir Ernest Ryder
gave an impromptu judgment, with which Longmore LJ agreed.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his judgment Sir Ernest said that</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the judge “did not give any reason why any part of the trimmed budget,
that is the wife’s basic needs budget, should be cut in explanation of why that
shortfall should not be met”;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>he “did not explain … why she should live below the basic needs budget
that he, the judge, had accepted in evidence”; and</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>his decision that “she would have to adjust her expenditure to reduce
those needs” was “a conclusion [which] required reasoning that is not in the
judgment”.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So the Court of Appeal allowed the wife’s appeal by varying the order
for periodical payments upwards from the annual sum of £13,200 to that of
£17,292, backdated to the date of the judge’s judgment. It refused the
husband’s application for permission to appeal to it on the ground that his
proposed appeal had no prospect of success.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The husband filed a notice of appeal to this court. He challenged the
increase in the order for periodical payments directed by the Court of Appeal.
But he also purported to challenge its refusal to discharge the order for
periodical payments; and, alternatively, its refusal to set a fixed period on
the wife’s continued receipt of them and/or to vary the amount of them
downwards. In these respects he was, however, purporting to challenge the Court
of Appeal’s refusal to permit him to appeal to itself on these grounds and, by
section 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999, no appeal can be brought
against a refusal of permission. So the order of this court was to limit its
permission for him to appeal to the single ground whether, in light of the fact
that provision had already been made for the wife’s housing needs in the
capital settlement, the Court of Appeal had been entitled to interfere with the
judge’s determination not to make full allowance for her need to pay rent in
the continuing order for periodical payments. Unfortunately the husband’s
advisers considered that the terms of the limited grant of permission could in
some way prove broad enough to enable them to make submissions at the hearing
along the wider lines of his impermissible challenge to the Court of Appeal’s
refusal to grant him permission to appeal to it. So at an early stage of the
hearing the court had to re-emphasise the limited ambit of its inquiry in this
particular case.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the greatest of respect to the Court of Appeal, and with (I
believe) a full appreciation of the heavy work-load under which it currently
labours, it erred in saying that the judge had given no reason for declining to
increase the order for periodical payments so as to enable the wife to meet all
her basic needs. The judge gave a clear reason which is summarised in paras 20
and 21 above.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>First, <i>Pearce v Pearce</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1054.html">[2003] EWCA Civ 1054</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1054.html">[2004] 1 WLR 68</a>. At
the time of the original order in 1997 the wife had owned a flat in Chelsea
free of mortgage. Later she sold the flat; depleted the proceeds by an
unfortunate speculation in Ireland; and, upon returning to live in London,
could only afford to buy a flat in Fulham subject to mortgage. The original
order had also provided for the husband to make periodical payments to the
wife; and the subsequent order under appeal in 2003 was to capitalise her
entitlement to periodical payments, ie to discharge the order for them upon
payment to her by the husband of a lump sum in lieu of them pursuant to section
31(7A) and (7B) of the Act. The major significance of the decision of the Court
of Appeal lies in its approach to the exercise of capitalising an order for
periodical payments. For present purposes, however, its significance lies in
its removal of the wife’s mortgage repayments from its calculation of the
amount of the periodical payments to which, in the absence of capitalisation,
she would then have been entitled and therefore of the amount of the lump sum
to be paid by the husband in lieu of them. Thorpe LJ said at para 36 that the
judge</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… should not have allowed the
wife to discharge her mortgage at the husband’s expense. Such an indemnity
violates the principle that capital claims compromised in 1997 could not be
revisited in 2003. There is simply no power or discretion to embark on further
adjustment of capital to reflect the outcome of unwise or unfortunate
investment on one side or prudent or lucky investment on the other.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, <i>North v North</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/760.html">[2007] EWCA Civ 760</a>, [2007] All ER (D) 386
(Jul). In 1981 an order by consent had provided the wife with ownership of a
mortgage-free house in Sheffield and of ground rents which generated a
comfortable income for her. The order had also included provision for the
husband to make periodical payments to her in a nominal sum. In 2000 the wife
sold her assets in England and moved to Sydney with “relatively disastrous”
financial consequences, which led her to apply for an upwards variation of the
order for periodical payments. The Court of Appeal set aside an order
capitalising her entitlement to them in the sum of £202,000 and, although not
visible in the transcript or in the report, apparently substituted a
substantially lower figure. Thorpe LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … In any application
under section 31 the Applicant’s needs are likely to be the dominant or
magnetic factor. But it does not follow that the respondent is inevitably
responsible financially for any established needs. He is not an insurer against
all hazards nor, when fairness is the measure, is he necessarily liable for
needs created by the applicant’s financial mismanagement, extravagance or
irresponsibility …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in the present case
the wife’s failure to utilise her earning potential, her subsequent abandonment
of the secure financial future provided for her by the husband, her choice of a
more hazardous future in Australia, together with her lifestyle choices in
Australia, were all productive of needs which she had generated and for which
the husband should not as a matter of fairness be held responsible in law.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And third, <i>Yates v Yates</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/532.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 532</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/532.html">[2013] 2 FLR 1070</a>.
Under a consent order the wife had received a substantial lump sum on the basis
that she would use half of it in discharging a mortgage on her home. In the
event she had repaid only part of the mortgage debt and had invested in a
non-income-bearing bond the sum which she had thus elected not to apply to full
clearance of the mortgage. When, later, a judge came to capitalise her right to
continuing periodical payments, he included in his calculation of her need the
amount of interest payable by her in respect of the residual mortgage debt. The
Court of Appeal held that the inclusion had been wrong. Thorpe LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … It seems to me little
more than common sense that if a recipient of a lump sum twice the size of the
mortgage on the final matrimonial home elects to hold back capital made
available for the mortgage discharge in order to invest in a bond that bears no
income, she cannot look to the payer thereafter for indemnity or contribution
to the continuing mortgage interest payments. That seems to me to be an
absolutely self-evident point.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Lewison LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … the need to pay the
mortgage at all arose from her own choice not to apply … the lump sum in
discharging the existing mortgage … The financial consequences of her
investment choice are her responsibility. It is wrong in principle for the
husband to have to continue to fund the mortgage.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Feehan QC, who, like Ms Dunseath, nobly appears for the wife without
fee, seeks to distinguish the mortgage instalments disallowed in the cases of <i>Pearce</i>
and <i>Yates</i> from payments of rent. I see no relevant distinction. He also
submits that, unlike the present case, all three of the decisions concerned the
capitalisation of an entitlement to periodical payments and that what was there
rightly disallowed was the insinuation into the lump sum thus payable of a sum
more reflective of an impermissible second claim for capital provision than of
a permissible claim for conversion into capital of an income entitlement. Mr
Feehan relies in particular on the statement of Thorpe LJ in the <i>Pearce</i>
case, quoted at para 36 above. I reject the submission. As the Court of Appeal
valuably established in that case, the first step in the exercise of
capitalisation is a calculation of the amount of periodical payments to which,
in the absence of capitalisation, the payee would then have been entitled. It
was in the course of making this calculation that in the three decisions the
objectionable elements of the claim were disallowed. Even had there been no
capitalisation of the entitlement to periodical payments, those elements would
therefore have been disallowed in quantifying the amount of the ongoing order
for periodical payments.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The cases of <i>Pearce</i>, <i>North</i> and <i>Yates</i> were correctly
decided. The answer to the question posed in para 1 above is yes. By its terms
that question asks only whether a court would be “entitled”, rather than
obliged, in the circumstances there identified to decline to require the
husband to fund payment of the rent. Its reference to the court’s entitlement
to do so serves to respect the wide discretion conferred upon it by section
31(1) and (7) of the Act in determining an application for variation of an
order for periodical payments. But, in the passages quoted above, the Court of
Appeal has expressed itself in forceful terms; and a court would need to give very
good reasons for requiring a spouse to fund payment of the other spouse’s rent
in the circumstances identified by the question. A spouse may well have an
obligation to make provision for the other; but an obligation to duplicate it
in such circumstances is most improbable.</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>The judge was clearly entitled to decline to vary the order for
periodical payments so as to require the husband to pay all of the wife’s rent.
The order of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and his order restored.</a></p><a name="para41">
