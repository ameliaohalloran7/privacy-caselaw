Ultimately, in <i>R (Detention Action) v First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/840.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 840</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/840.html">[2015] 1 WLR 5341</a> (known as “<i>DA6</i>”), the Court of Appeal held that the FTR 2014 were “structurally unfair, unjust and ultra vires”, and that they fell to be quashed. Permission to appeal to this court against that decision was refused. Lord Dyson MR, with whom Briggs and Bean LJJ agreed, held:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An appeal is bound to seek to challenge the reasons given by the SSHD for refusing the asylum claim. As I have said, many refusals turn on adverse findings on the appellant’s credibility. The focus of the preparation for an appeal will often, therefore, be on the search for evidence to corroborate the appellant’s account in rebuttal of the adverse findings. The period of seven days between the date of the refusal decision and the hearing of the appeal is bound to be insufficient in a significant number of cases. I have referred to the difficulties facing legal representatives who have to take instructions from clients who are in detention. It may not be possible for them to say whether the further inquiries that they wish to make are likely to be fruitful. In such a situation, it may be difficult to persuade the tribunal that there are cogent reasons to transfer a case out of the fast track.” (para 42)</p> 
<a name="para3">
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is a consequence of the decision in <i>DA6</i>. TN, the appellant, lost her appeal against the Secretary of State’s decision to reject her asylum claim under the FTR 2005. She brought a challenge by way of judicial review to that determination of her appeal, contending the FTR 2005 also fell to be quashed. Ouseley J, who heard her application, agreed on that issue, and there is no appeal from that part of his order: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/59.html">[2017] EWHC 59 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/59.html">[2017] 1 WLR 2595</a>. But, significantly, TN then contended that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) in her case also fell automatically to be quashed. Ouseley J rejected that contention and in addition held that she could not show that the FTT’s decision was unfairly made in her case. The judge had to consider TN’s long and complex immigration history.</p> 
<a name="para4">
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal upheld his decision and TN now appeals with permission to this court: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2838.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 2838</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/2838.html">[2019] 1 WLR 2647</a>. Singh LJ gave the leading judgment, with which Sharp and Peter Jackson LJJ agreed. He lucidly and succinctly explained why the decision in <i>DA6</i> did not automatically lead to the nullification of all orders made by the FTT under the FTR 2005. His principal reasons were as follows:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“80.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … The true position, in my view, is (as illustrated by the task performed by Ouseley J in the present two cases) that the court must engage in a close analysis of the sequence of events in order to determine whether subsequent decisions are indeed to be set aside.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I see force in Mr Tam’s submissions based on cases such as <i>Percy v Hall</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1348.html">[1997] QB 924</a>, in particular at pp 947-948, and <i>R (Draga) v</i> <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/842.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 842</a>, I consider that it is unnecessary to examine them in detail because they were decided in different contexts. For example, <i>Percy v Hall</i> was concerned with whether an innocent third party (in that case a police constable who arrested a person pursuant to a byelaw which was later found to be ultra vires) can be liable for damages, in that case for the tort of false imprisonment.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment, the straightforward argument made on behalf of the appellants by Ms Lieven must be rejected on its own merits in the present context and without the need for extensive reference to authority from other contexts.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first and fundamental reason for this is that, in my view, there is a conceptual distinction between holding that the procedural rules were ultra vires and the question whether the procedure in an individual appeal decision was unfair.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the court to consider the lawfulness of a procedural regime, such as that in the 2014 Rules (which was quashed as a result of the Court of Appeal decision in <i>DA6</i>) … is an important one … In order to challenge the entire system of such rules it is not necessary to show that the rules will lead to unfairness in every case. Rather it is the creation by the rules of an ‘unacceptable risk’ of unfairness which founds the ability of the court to strike them down. This is because it is important that rules which are systematically capable of creating unfairness should not be allowed to stand and should be removed or amended.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that does not entail the necessary conclusion that in each and every case decided pursuant to the ultra vires procedural rules a particular decision was itself procedurally unfair. This is reinforced by the consideration that, in <i>DA6</i> itself, the Court of Appeal said that the 2014 Rules would inevitably lead to unfairness in a ‘significant’ number of cases. The court did not expand upon what that meant, for example whether it meant in a majority of cases or in a significant minority of cases. That was unnecessary. Similarly, it had been unnecessary in the <i>Refugee Legal Centre</i> case, which concerned a policy rather than secondary legislation but where the analysis was similar. It was for that reason that, in the <i>Refugee Legal Centre</i> case, the court did not feel it appropriate to consider evidence as to how the scheme had operated in practice. It was the fact that a scheme was capable of creating unfairness in an unacceptable way which would render the scheme unlawful.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Tam that ‘jurisdiction’ to determine the appeals in the pure or narrow sense of that word (the legal authority to decide a question) existed by virtue of the primary legislation (section 82 of the 2002 Act)<a name="ORIGHIT_264"></a><a name="HIT_264"></a> and the FTT was not deprived of jurisdiction in that sense by reason of the fact that the 2005 Rules were ultra vires. I would also reject Ms Lieven’s suggestion that the FTT’s jurisdiction was created by the 2005 Rules themselves. She submitted that a valid appeal required a notice of appeal to be filed in accordance with rule 6 of the Principal Rules, applied to the fast track process by rule 6 of the 2005 Rules. In my view, that submission is misconceived. It is a commonplace feature of an appellate system that there will be procedural rules which require a notice of appeal to be filed in a certain form. That is not what creates the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal; it is merely a rule which regulates procedure<a name="ORIGHIT_265"></a><a name="HIT_265"></a> and form. What creates the jurisdiction is the principal legislation, here the 2002 Act.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in my view, that would only go so far in meeting Ms Lieven’s fundamental submission, which is that any appeal decision which was made under those Rules was necessarily infected by the fact that they were unlawful because they created an unacceptable risk of procedural unfairness. It is in that sense that she submits the FTT did not have jurisdiction, in other words a post-<i>Anisminic</i> understanding of jurisdiction: not in the pure or narrow sense of having the legal authority to determine a question, but that a body has acted in a way which is unlawful, including (for this purpose) in a way which is procedurally unfair. That said, it seems to me that the answer which Mr Tam gives to that contention is correct: there has to be shown to be procedural unfairness on the facts of the individual case. …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would add that, as a matter of legal principle, if the appellants’ submissions on the first issue were correct, it would necessarily follow that even appeal decisions where the appeal was allowed would fall to be set aside, because they would be a nullity. That cannot possibly be correct. At the hearing before us Ms Lieven submitted that this was a theoretical point and not a real one, since in practice individuals will have been granted leave to remain in the light of a successful appeal decision and this would not be curtailed. However, in my view, it is revealing that, if the logic of her submission were accepted, this would be the result as a matter of principle. That analysis of principle helps to test whether the submission can be correct.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Singh LJ then helpfully summarised the approach to be taken when there was a challenge to the fairness of a hearing under the FTR. He formulated a non-exhaustive list of four factors, which I will call the four <i>TN</i> factors:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“103.&nbsp; For the future I would recommend that a court which has to consider an application to set aside an earlier appeal decision made under the 2005 Rules should approach its task having regard to the following:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high degree of fairness is required in this context.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the Court of Appeal said in <i>DA6</i> … should be borne in mind: that the 2005 Rules created an unacceptable risk of unfairness in a significant number of cases. Depending on the facts it may be that the case which the court is considering is one of those cases.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no presumption that the procedure was fair or unfair. It is necessary to consider whether there was a causal link between the risk of unfairness that was created by the 2005 Rules and what happened in the particular case before the court.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should also be borne in mind that finality in litigation is important. There may be a need to ask how long the delay was after the appeal decision was taken before any complaint was made about the fairness of the procedure. There may also need to be an examination of what steps were taken, and how quickly, to adduce the evidence that is later relied on (for example medical evidence) and whether it can fairly be said that in truth those further steps were taken for other reasons, such as a later decision by the Secretary of State to set removal directions. This may suggest that there is no causal link between the risk of unfairness that was created by the 2005 Rules and what happened in the particular case before the court.</p> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para5">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above should not be regarded as an exhaustive checklist. At the end of the day, there can be no substitute for asking the only question which has to be determined: </a><a name="_Hlk77617149">was the procedure unfair in the particular case? </a>That has to be determined by reference to all the facts of the individual case.”</p>

She gave evidence. She claimed religious persecution and claimed that in 2003, her mother, her priest and she had all been arrested by the Vietnamese authorities for fund-raising activities for the church. She left Vietnam in 2003 and came to the UK and, following an unsuccessful claim to asylum, she was removed from the UK back to Vietnam in 2012. She contends that she was then detained by the police and questioned about the money she had raised. She managed to escape, and she then returned to the UK. She contended that she had been raped several times by a man claiming to help her reach the UK. She became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage in July 2014, but this did not form any part of her claim to asylum.</p>

She contended that her mother had died in 2003. She said that she had no children but in 2003 she claimed that she had two children in Vietnam. She had made a fresh claim in 2011, but she did not then mention the difficulties that she and her mother had had in Vietnam. Mr Quang Minh Dang and Mr Quang Hai Tran gave evidence about their friendships with her in the UK.</p>

There were discrepancies and inconsistencies in her evidence, and, although she knew about the immigration process, she had not made a claim to asylum until she was arrested, which was some months after arriving in the UK on the second occasion. The FTT rejected her claim to asylum, under the Refugee Convention, the EU Qualification Directive, under the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”) and under the Immigration Rules.</p>

Her first claim to asylum was in January 2004 when she claimed asylum because of religious persecution against Catholics in Vietnam. Her claim was refused for non-compliance and treated as withdrawn because she failed to report as required. She was arrested on suspicion of being an illegal entrant in 2007 and was granted temporary admission but again failed to report. In 2011 she made further submissions to the Secretary of State and claimed that she was entitled to asylum again on the basis of religious persecution in Vietnam. She was detained at a nail bar and found to have £1,000 in cash.</p>

She claims to have entered the UK clandestinely in about May 2014. On about 21 July 2014 she had a miscarriage and went to hospital. She was arrested on suspicion of illegally working while she was present in the nail bar, also in July 2014. She was again detained.</p>

She contended that she could not be returned to Vietnam because of religious persecution. She also stated that her mother and the local priest caused a financial crisis in the community, which led people to complain to the Vietnamese authorities who arrested her.</p>

The background to this decision-making is that the Home Office is one of the UK’s competent authorities for the purposes of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings 2005, and it is responsible for making conclusive decisions on whether a person has been trafficked. (Human trafficking is also known as Modern Slavery.) The “reasonable grounds” decision is the first step in that process. The National Referral Mechanism is responsible for ensuring that victims of trafficking receive appropriate support. Where there is a credible suspicion that an individual has been trafficked, article 4 of the Convention requires that the competent authority should assess whether they are a victim of trafficking as part of the state’s duty to protect them: see <i>Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/22.html">(2010) 51 EHRR 1</a> and <i>VCL and AN v United Kingdom</i> (Application Nos 77587/12 and 74603/12, judgment of 16 February 2021: <i>The Times</i> 17 March 2021).</p>

She said at one interview that she had not been tortured. She did, however, contend that she had been raped many times on the journey to the UK. At her substantive asylum interview, she claimed that on her return to Vietnam in 2012 she had been detained in a detention centre where she was subject to torture. She further contended that her persecution was because of her mother’s political activities and because she had been involved in raising funds for the local church. She said that she had been beaten and ill-treated by the Vietnamese authorities. She said that that was the cause of scars on her head and finger. She said that she had become pregnant because of rape and had suffered the miscarriage, which I have already mentioned, and that that had caused her distress.</p>

She said that he had provided her with free food and accommodation and that she had returned to the UK to be with him. There was another gentleman involved, Mr Tran, whom I have also already mentioned. TN said that she felt safe in the UK. Both Mr Dang and Mr Tran gave evidence before the FTT, but their evidence was not accepted.</p>

She said that she had also been a victim of a sex trafficker when she was brought back to the UK, but it is apparent that her real claim to asylum was fear of ill-treatment by the Vietnamese authorities. She did not allege that she was a victim of ongoing human trafficking in the UK. At the hearing of the appeal, she withdrew any reliance on the allegations of rape.</p>

They sought the cancellation of the removal directions which had by then been made against her. By this stage TN had a witness statement from Dr Rachel Bingham of Medical Justice, a general practitioner with extensive experience of assessment of victims of torture and other serious abuse. Dr Bingham’s evaluation, based on what TN had told her, was that TN’s presentation, including her scars and injuries, was highly consistent with her history of trafficking, imprisonment, multiple rapes and forced prostitution.</p>

This rejection of her fresh claim was challenged within these proceedings by way of judicial review (outlined in para 3 above). Those proceedings were in due course heard by Ouseley J. As part of his thorough and impressive judgment, Ouseley J quashed the rejection of the new submissions. He considered that the Secretary of State was wrong not to treat her further submissions as a fresh claim, but that that step did not entitle the appellant to a retrial of the issues which the FTT had decided, which was the principal reason for the judicial review proceedings. The fresh claim has yet to be determined.</p>

Ms Kellaway-Payne notes that the Home Office Guidance to Front Line Staff (Victims of Modern Slavery: Frontline Staff Guidance Version 2) also recognises that “Potential victims of modern slavery may be reluctant to come forward with information, may not recognise themselves as having been trafficked or enslaved and may tell their stories with obvious errors.” Ms Kellaway-Payne’s evaluation was that the marks on TN’s body and various elements of her account of her time in Vietnam, her journey to the UK and her experiences in the UK were “sufficient objective indicators” of human trafficking to suggest that TN may have been a victim of human trafficking.

This required that the power to make Tribunal Procedure Rules be exercised so that “the tribunal system is accessible and fair.” Furthermore, UK law places considerable importance on the right to have a fair trial. This is an uncontroversial proposition.

It is sufficient to mention the first:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The first was described by Lord Hoffmann (<i>ibid</i>) [<i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF (No 3)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/28.html">[2010] 2 AC 269</a>, para 72] as the avoidance of the sense of injustice which the person who is the subject of the decision will otherwise feel.

He submits that the courts will not deny a remedy because the right to be heard makes no difference on the facts of the individual case. He argues in effect that fairness is such a fundamental aspect of the justice system that the courts will not decline to give relief in circumstances such as these simply because the appellant could not show that she would have succeeded on her appeal.

Those features were an accelerated timetable which made it difficult to obtain corroborative evidence; a large volume of tasks facing the legal representative; limited access to the legal representative; lack of legal representation and complexity of the case (present in many asylum appeals). In the further alternative, Lord Pannick submits that there should in this situation be a presumption to that effect.</p>

She submits that the accelerated timetable imposed by the FTR 2005 was peculiarly prone to have a particular adverse impact on the victim of human trafficking. This is because a victim of human trafficking is likely to need more time to obtain medical reports and so on and the person is unlikely to be willing to disclose information that would give rise to such a claim at the outset. The Secretary of State had failed to pick up the indicators of human trafficking in TN’s case, for instance, that she had been raped on her journey to the UK.</p> 
</a><a name="para40">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, submits Ms Harrison, TN should have been referred before the hearing of her appeal in the FTT to the National Referral Mechanism (see para 16 above) for assessment as a possible victim of human trafficking. The FTR 2005 were only for comparatively straightforward appeals and TN’s case should not have been included in that system. Home Office guidance refers to factors which may make it difficult for a victim of trafficking to come forward; it provides:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the following: trauma (mental, psychological, or emotional), inability to express themselves clearly, mistrust of authorities, feelings of shame and painful memories (particularly those of a sexual nature).” (<i>Victims of modern slavery - Competent Authority guidance</i>, version 3.0, p 99)</p>

The overriding risk was that TN would not have the time required to prepare and present her trafficking claim. Clear indicators of human trafficking were present. Such indicators included her physical injuries and that she presented as a vulnerable person. Dr Bingham had opined that TN’s injuries were highly consistent with her account of beatings and rapes and that she exhibited signs of mental trauma. As Dr Bingham put it, persons who are trafficked do not self-identify.</p>

TN was legally represented. Her original claim in January 2004 after she was first encountered was that she was subjected to religious persecution in Vietnam because of her faith. She was not believed and was subject to removal. There was no appeal to the FTT from the determinations of the Secretary of State.</p>

She did not produce evidence of these allegations, but at the hearing of her appeal, two friends whom she claimed to have had during her trafficking were called on to give evidence.

To say that a whole process of adjudication is unfair is to declare that there is an inherent risk of unfairness: it does not mean that there was unfairness in every individual case.

It is not enough, as the appellant seeks to do, to rely on <i>R (</i><i>DN (Rwanda)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/7.html">[2020] UKSC 7</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/7.html">[2020] AC 698</a> where the order for deportation was held to be invalid where the statutory instrument under which it was made was held to be ultra vires.

In particular he submits that if regard were had to the presence of some or all of the features of unfairness identified in <i>DA6</i>, no regard would be paid to the extent to which unfairness arising from those factors had fructified in any individual case. There could be a range of reasons why corroborative evidence was not obtained which had nothing to do with the accelerated timetable. An event occurring in relation to a determination under the FTR 2005 should also not be capable of leading automatically to that determination being set aside if it would equally have occurred under the ordinary rules applying to appeals, which it is not contended were systemically unfair. A presumption was inappropriate when the decision in <i>DA6</i> had identified the risk of unfairness, not unfairness in individual cases, which would have to be the product of a multifactorial evaluation of the circumstances of the case.</p>

For instance, there was a shortened timetable (two days for serving a notice of appeal from the date of the decision, which the FTT could only extend in limited circumstances: see rule 8, with the hearing potentially to follow as soon as possible after the date on which the respondent provided certain documents: rule 12), and the limited power of the FTT to permit an adjournment of the hearing (rule 28). These elements of the FTR 2014 are capable of impacting very adversely on the asylum-seeker’s preparation of his case. Ouseley J reasoned back from the ruling in <i>DA6</i> regarding inherent unfairness in the FTR 2014 to conclude that there was similar unfairness inherent in the FTR 2005, which had similar features.</p>

She firstly contends that her appeal should be allowed because the system created by the FTR 2005 was unfair and the consequence is that the determination of her appeal was automatically null and void or should be declared or presumed to be null and void because it possessed some of the features of unfairness identified in <i>DA6</i>. Her second argument is that it operated unfairly in her case.</p>

The fact that the FTR 2005 were held to be structurally unfair does not mean that the hearing was unfair when the rules are applied to her particular case. The position is analogous to saying that an institution is institutionally unfair or biased. An institution can be institutionally unfair or biased without every single person within it having the same approach or attitude or every single person who comes into contact with the institution being treated in an unfair or biased way.</p>

In at least a proportion of cases, that objective will have been achieved.

Both Ouseley J (at paras 73 to 75 of his judgment) and Singh LJ (at paras 86 and 87 of his judgment, referring to jurisdiction in its post-<i>Anisminic</i> sense) made the point that the FTT had jurisdiction despite the invalidity of the FTR. The appellant’s case in this court did not challenge these paragraphs, and in his oral submissions Lord Pannick implicitly accepted that the FTT had jurisdiction but submitted that its decision was inextricably linked to the FTR 2005 and so ought to be set aside (see <i>DN (Rwanda)</i>, especially para 19).</p>

Provided that the FTT was fair in its conduct of the appeal, its decision was accordingly valid. In turn if, because of following the rules, its determination was unfair, the FTT would have no jurisdiction, and the resultant determination should be set aside. On this analysis, there is no automatic nullification of the FTT’s decision and it is for the appellant to establish that it ought to be set aside. As to Lord Pannick’s submission on <i>DN (Rwanda) </i>referred to in the preceding paragraph, I accept Mr Tam’s submission for the reason he gives (para 47 above) and reject the argument based on inextricable link.</p>

This principle has been acted on for many years. In relation to judicial decisions, the rationale of the principle must be to bring litigation to an end and to promote certainty, especially in property and status matters.

I accept that submission and hold that it supports the conclusion to which I have come. It would undermine confidence in the legal system if automatic nullification were the result, which is one of the reasons why it is in the public interest that there should, at an appropriate stage, always be finality in litigation.</p>

I can explain my reason for this conclusion by reference to <i>Millar v Dickson</i>, on which Lord Pannick principally relied. In that case the Privy Council, in exercise of its devolution jurisdiction in relation to Scotland, held that temporary sheriffs, whose contracts were subject to control by the Lord Advocate, were not independent for the purposes of article 6 of the Convention, and, therefore, that there was apparent bias. I accept that this was also a systemic issue. The remedy given was to set aside judgments in cases in which the temporary sheriffs had appeared. Another example, but not of a systemic issue, would be <i>Serafin v Malkiewicz</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/23.html">[2020] UKSC 23</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/23.html">[2020] 1 WLR 2455</a>, a recent decision of this court, where it was held that the decision of the judge who had intervened unfairly in a trial should be set aside in its entirety irrespective of the quality of the judgment on any particular point. In that case, however, the interventions had occurred throughout the hearing.</p> 
<a name="para60">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not find the analogy with judicial bias cases convincing. It is not always the case that bias on the part of the judge will result in the trial being declared unfair. It may be that the party waived its right to object, or the defect complained of may be cured by an appeal hearing (neither of those points of course applies here). The reason for a strict rule in relation to apparent bias is that there was no way in which the defect could be cured, and it was one that persisted throughout the hearing. It would be wrong to require the parties to show that there was an actual lack of independence. In other words, the apparent bias of the temporary sheriffs was a defect which could not be purged. As Lord Clyde cogently put it in <i>Millar</i> at para 83: “The independence of the judiciary is not an empty principle which can be forgotten simply because one thinks that a correct conclusion has been reached. Rightly or wrongly, there is always room for an uneasy fear that there might have been some improper influence affecting the mind of the judge where he lacks independence.” By contrast, it is possible in this instance for the party who wishes to say that the hearing, attended by both parties, was unfair, to identify the particular respect in which the trial was not fair to him or her.</p>

Likewise, there has been no complaint about the quality of the reasoning in the decision. As Lord Dyson said, tribunal judges could be relied on to conduct the trials fairly within the rules. TN, therefore, must show a particular respect in which the rules impacted adversely on her in terms of the conduct of the hearing. There was no application for any adjournment, and she was represented by counsel. I do not consider that it is enough to say that features were present in her appeal which were also identified in <i>DA6</i>: she must show that those factors impacted upon her so as thereby to render the hearing of her appeal unfair. It follows that I would also reject a presumption that the trial was as a result unfair. The information to show that it was unfair must be in the appellant’s hands.</p>

In <i>Pathan</i>, the appellant applied for leave to remain under Tier 2 of the points-based immigration system, which allows UK employers to recruit skilled workers to fill a particular vacancy if it cannot be filled with a UK worker. But the employer must be a licensed sponsor and, if his licence is withdrawn, leave to remain will be refused. The applicant in this case made his application using a valid certificate of sponsorship, but the Secretary of State revoked the licence to give such certificates before making a decision on Mr Pathan’s application and without informing him that his application was bound to fail. Thus, he had no opportunity to find another sponsor. Mr Pathan did not seek to show that he would have succeeded in finding a new sponsor. Nonetheless, the court, Lord Briggs dissenting, held that the Secretary of State should have informed Mr Pathan of its revocation of the licence. It did not matter that it was unlikely that Mr Pathan could have found another sponsor in the short time available.</p>

The same rules of natural justice can apply to administrative decisions as well as judicial decisions. But the circumstances are not the same. Mr Pathan could show that he lost an <i>opportunity</i> to seek a fresh sponsor. If TN could show that, because of the unfairness of the FTR 2005, she lost the opportunity to develop some part of her then case that she will now be unable to pursue, she would be similarly placed. But she cannot show that that was so. She has since made what she contended was a <i>fresh</i> claim “regarding her sex trafficking matter” (letter dated 19 August 2015 from Linga &amp; Co to the Yarl’s Wood Detention Centre). That is not the claim that she advanced at the appeal hearing.</p>

It is well established that the decision-maker is not constrained by rules of evidence and has to consider all material considerations when making an assessment about the future (see <i>Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/11.html">[2000] 3 All ER 449</a>). Bingham LJ observed in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Thirukumar</i> [1989] Imm AR 402, 414:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is … plain that asylum decisions are of such moment that only the highest standards of fairness will suffice.”</p>

In this analysis it may be helpful to follow the methodology in <i>The Right to a Fair Trial in International Law</i>, Clooney and Webb, (Oxford, 2021) which disaggregates the right to a fair trial into a number of separate elements, such as the right to an independent tribunal, the right to prepare a defence, the right to adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence, the right to be present, the right to examine witnesses, the right to an interpreter and so on. A disaggregated analysis may assist the court to form a clearer view as to the causes, and causative effect, of any departure from what fairness required. Of course, at the end of the day, the court must look at the matter in the round and determine whether the hearing, as a whole, was unfair because of the FTR 2005. In that regard the courts can follow the “overall” approach of the European Court of Human Rights, which was explained by the Grand Chamber of that court in <i>Al-Khawaja and Tahery v United Kingdom</i> (Application Nos 26766/05 and 22228/06) (2011) 32 BHRC 1 in these terms:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Traditionally, when examining complaints under article 6(1), the court has carried out its examination of the overall fairness of the proceedings by having regard to such factors as the way in which statutory safeguards have been applied, the extent to which procedural opportunities were afforded to the defence to counter handicaps that it laboured under and the manner in which the proceedings as a whole have been conducted by the trial judge (see, for example, <i>Murray v United Kingdom</i> [1996] ECHR 18731/91).” (para 144)</p>

But the system is not inquisitorial but adversarial. The trial takes place at the hearing, and it is not a continuous fact-finding process which goes beyond that hearing. The appellant must bring forward his case at the hearing, not subsequently. If he is prevented from doing so, he should apply for an adjournment.</p>

Although he was prepared to annul the Secretary of State’s adverse decision on her fresh claim that she had been trafficked on her second journey to the UK, a claim that still has to be dealt with, he did not consider that the fairness of the hearing was infected by the defects in the rules.</p> 
</a><a name="para70">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the question whether there was unfairness in the way her case was dealt with. I agree with what has been said in this regard by Ouseley J and by the Court of Appeal, who considered the facts in great detail. For TN to succeed on this part of her appeal she would have to show that they were wrong in law, and in my judgment this plainly cannot be shown. There were many inconsistencies in her evidence including the date of the death of her mother, to whom she was clearly close. She had originally said at the time of her first asylum claim that her mother had died in 1999, but on her second claim she contended that her mother had died in 2003 in prison. She falsely claimed to have two children in Vietnam, and so on. It is not appropriate for the court to say anything about her fresh claim.</p> 
</a><a name="para71">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a further reason why unfairness in part is not shown. She has a fresh claim that she was trafficked on her second journey to the UK and in the UK. That claim has yet to be determined and, if she wishes to challenge the determination of the Secretary of State of that claim, she will be able to do so under a procedure outside the FTR. In my judgment, that fresh claim operates (if the procedure runs its course) as a rehearing would have done to remedy any defect in the handling of her trafficking claim. Any defect in the handling of the claim which is reheard falls by the wayside and is therefore cured by that process: there is no need to set aside the FTT’s determination to allow her to bring her trafficking claim.</p>

There is no causal link between the unfairness, which as I see it surrounded the trafficking claim and only that claim, and the persecution and maltreatment claims. That being so, the determination of the latter should stand. I would also endorse the non-exhaustive list of <i>TN</i> factors as giving helpful guidance for future cases. I would also endorse Singh LJ’s summation of the ultimate issue in para 104 of his judgment. At the end of the day the question is, subject always to <i>TN</i> factor 1 (which requires a high standard of fairness to be shown: see <i>Thirukumar</i> per Bingham LJ): was the FTR procedure unfair in the particular case? I consider that this test is less open to the risk of ambiguity than that proposed by Mr Tam, namely whether the outcome would have been the same under the ordinary rules applying to appeals, which it is not contended were systemically unfair: what the appellant is entitled to is a fair hearing appropriate to her claim and it is no answer that the appeal would have failed even if not unfair to her. If, applying the anxious scrutiny required of any asylum claim, the court or tribunal is satisfied that the hearing of an appeal was fair to the appellant, it is its duty to say so and dismiss the application to set aside the determination of any appeal.</p>

TN was detained and her appeal was processed and heard within the framework for speedy consideration set by the FTR 2005. By its decision dated 22 August 2014 the FTT dismissed the appeal (“the FTT decision”). In its reasons, the FTT made various findings adverse to TN and found her account of the circumstances which she said gave rise to fear of ill-treatment if returned to Vietnam to be incredible. TN did not apply for permission to appeal against the FTT decision. Pursuant to that decision she remained in detention pending her removal from the UK.</p>

The authorities which gave rise to the argument that the FTR 2005 were ultra vires came after the FTT decision and it was fair that TN should have the opportunity to challenge that decision by reference to that argument, which meant that judicial review was the appropriate way to seek to do that.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“86.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Tam [counsel for the Secretary of State] that ‘jurisdiction’ to determine the appeals in the pure or narrow sense of that word (the legal authority to decide a question) existed by virtue of the primary legislation (section 82 of the 2002 Act) and the FTT was not deprived of jurisdiction in that sense by reason of the fact that the 2005 Rules were ultra vires. I would also reject Ms Lieven’s [counsel for TN] suggestion that the FTT’s jurisdiction was created by the 2005 Rules themselves. She submitted that a valid appeal required a notice of appeal to be filed in accordance with rule 6 of the Principal Rules, applied to the fast track process by rule 6 of the 2005 [Fast Track] Rules. In my view, that submission is misconceived. It is a commonplace feature of an appellate system that there will be procedural rules which require a notice of appeal to be filed in a certain form. That is not what creates the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal; it is merely a rule which regulates procedure and form. What creates the jurisdiction is the principal legislation, here the 2002 Act.</p> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para82">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in my view, that would only go so far in meeting Ms Lieven’s fundamental submission, which is that any appeal decision which was made under those Rules was necessarily infected by the fact that they were unlawful because they created an unacceptable risk of procedural unfairness. It is in that sense that she submits the FTT did not have jurisdiction, in other words a post-<i>Anisminic</i> [<i>Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/6.html">[1969] 2 AC 147</a>] understanding of jurisdiction: not in the pure or narrow sense of having the legal authority to determine a question, but that a body has acted in a way which is unlawful, including (for this purpose) in a way which is procedurally unfair. That said, it seems to me that the answer which Mr Tam gives to that contention is correct: there has to be shown to be procedural unfairness on the facts of the individual case.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">I think this reasoning is impeccable.</p>

That means that it would have to be established that it was a decision arrived at outside the jurisdiction conferred by section 82(1) of the 2002 Act. That provision includes as an implied condition that a decision should be arrived at fairly: that means, fairly in the circumstances of the individual case.</p>

Every litigant has a right to determination of their dispute by a judge or tribunal which is impartial and unbiased, meaning free both of actual bias and of any appearance of bias. In terms of section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, this is a further implied condition for the valid exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by that provision. If the FTT in TN’s case had been biased in fact or had given an appearance of bias, the FTT decision would fall to be quashed. But there is no suggestion that the FTT was biased or that it gave any appearance of a lack of impartiality. Quite simply, these points do not support Lord Pannick’s contention that the mere fact that the FTT operated under the procedure set out in the FTR 2005 means that it acted outside its jurisdiction; rather, they support the alternative analysis set out by Singh LJ.</p>

Whether a FTT acting under the FTR 2005 procedure acts unfairly in an individual case will depend upon the particular circumstances of that case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">87.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this issue I consider that the guidance given by Singh LJ later in his judgment is correct:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“103.&nbsp; For the future I would recommend that a court which has to consider an application to set aside an earlier appeal decision made under the 2005 Rules should approach its task having regard to the following:- (1) A high degree of fairness is required in this context. (2) What the Court of Appeal said in <i>DA6</i> should be borne in mind: that [by parity of reasoning] the 2005 Rules created an unacceptable risk of unfairness in a significant number of cases. Depending on the facts it may be that the case which the court is considering is one of those cases. (3) There is no presumption that the procedure was fair or unfair. It is necessary to consider whether there was a causal link between the risk of unfairness that was created by the 2005 Rules and what happened in the particular case before the court. (4) It should also be borne in mind that finality in litigation is important. There may be a need to ask how long the delay was after the appeal decision was taken before any complaint was made about the fairness of the procedure. There may also need to be an examination of what steps were taken, and how quickly, to adduce the evidence that is later relied on (for example medical evidence) and whether it can fairly be said that in truth those further steps were taken for other reasons, such as a later decision by the Secretary of State to set removal directions. This may suggest that there is no causal link between the risk of unfairness that was created by the 2005 Rules and what happened in the particular case before the court.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above should not be regarded as an exhaustive checklist. At the end of the day, there can be no substitute for asking the only question which has to be determined: was the procedure unfair in the particular case? That has to be determined by reference to all the facts of the individual case.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">88.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These points flow from the analysis under issue (1) above. If any person wishes to contend that a decision of a tribunal, like the FTT, or an inferior court of limited jurisdiction, is unlawful and therefore void and of no effect, they have to bring forward a case to make good that contention. In the present context, depending on the circumstances of their case, they may gain some assistance in doing that by referring to the way in which the FTR 2005 had a practical impact on them and seeking to show that the reasoning in <i>DA6 </i>(and as adopted in relation to the FTR 2005 in the present proceedings) indicates that this involved unfairness in the way in which they themselves were treated. But it is not helpful or appropriate to speak of there being a presumption of unfairness if a decision has been taken under the FTR 2005, as Lord Pannick sought to do.</p>

TN appears to have done that, and so was granted permission to apply for judicial review. Claimants who delay without good reason may not be granted permission to proceed.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Issue (3): Fairness in the circumstances of TN’s case</p> 
</a><a name="para90">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">90.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ouseley J examined with utmost care the circumstances of TN’s case and the way in which it was considered by the FTT and concluded that the FTT had acted fairly in making the FTT decision. He summarised the position at paras 141-142 of his judgment:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“141.&nbsp; I am not persuaded that the appeal decision was unfair. There was no real basis for contemplating that [TN] was a trafficked woman, in the light of her immigration history, the absence of any indication from her that she had been trafficked despite her knowledge of the asylum system and the risk of return on the story she had given. The fact that she had scarring did not, without more, mean that there was a need for a rule 35 report. She had been seen by the detention centre GP. I agree with Ms Barnes [counsel for the Secretary of State] that a number of indicators, such as evading authorities, are consistent with not wanting to be removed from the UK. Merely asking to be removed from the DFT [detained fast track] proves nothing. So I see nothing in her presentation in the DFT to show that she should not have been in it at all.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was represented throughout by solicitors. She made no application for a rule 35 report. No adjournment was sought so that an appointment could be obtained with the Medical Foundation for example. Transfer out was not sought from the immigration judge. No adjournment was sought in order to obtain medical evidence of any sort. There was no indication either made expressly or noted by the immigration judge from observation, that the issues which were raised could not be dealt with in that time frame, or that further evidence, oral or documentary, was awaited or even obtainable. The possible relevance of what happened on the journey to the UK was not pursued. The immigration judge could assess the two men present who gave evidence, knowing that one was alleged to be a boyfriend. Such further evidence as came did not come within the time-frame that the application of the Principal Rules would have permitted, but was first presented over a year after the appeal decision. There is no basis for supposing that the evidence would have been relevant to whether her claim as advanced to the SSHD or on appeal was credible. There is no evidence that she would have presented a completely different claim if only she had had more time in which to produce medical evidence of the sort she did a year later. I note what is said in <i>DA2</i> [2014] EWHC 2525 (Admin) at para 8 that applicants’ solicitors said that they were often preparing fresh claims before the substantive appeal was finally determined since they anticipated its receipt but not quickly enough for the DFT timetable. She made no complaint about the fairness of the appeal hearing or procedure in her first judicial review proceedings. The further representations leading to the August decision had provided no evidence that the appeal decision was unfair. It was only in these judicial review proceedings lodged on 20 August 2015 that the fairness of the appeal proceedings was raised. Accordingly, I would not have quashed the appeal decision. …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">91.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question for the Court of Appeal was whether he was “wrong” in the assessment he made in applying well known standards of fairness to the particular facts of TN’s case: CPR Part 52.21 and para 129 in the judgment of Singh LJ. Singh LJ considered (para 130), rightly in my view, that it could not be said that the judge’s assessment was “wrong” in the requisite sense. In arriving at that conclusion, Singh LJ (with the agreement of the other members of the court) himself reviewed the circumstances of the case with particular care (paras 131-150). As he pointed out (para 147):</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the fundamental difficulty for [TN’s] appeal is that many of her reasons for not producing evidence are not attributable to the shortened timetable which was to be found in the 2005 Rules. Instead, they relate to the receipt of threats from alleged traffickers. It may also be (as the chronology appears to support) that representations were not made on her behalf until action was prompted by the imminence of removal directions.”</p>

Neither Ouseley J nor the Court of Appeal can be said to have been wrong in their assessment. Indeed, I agree with what they say.</p>
