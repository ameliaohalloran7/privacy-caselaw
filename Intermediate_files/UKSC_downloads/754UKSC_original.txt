Many businesses have insurance policies which cover them against loss arising from interruption of the business due to various causes. Thousands of claims have been made under such policies which the insurers have declined to pay on the ground that the policies do not cover effects (or certain effects) of the pandemic. This appeal has been heard urgently in a test case brought to clarify whether or not there is cover in principle for COVID-19 related losses under a variety of different standard insurance policy wordings.</a></p><a name="para1">

This is a scheme which enables a claim raising issues of general importance to financial markets to be determined in a test case without the need for a specific dispute between the parties where immediately relevant and authoritative English law guidance is needed.</a></p><a name="para2"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The FCA has brought the proceedings for the benefit of policyholders, many of whom are small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”). The defendants are eight insurers who are leading providers of business interruption insurance. As set out in a Framework Agreement between the parties, the aim of the proceedings is to achieve the maximum clarity possible for the maximum number of policyholders and their insurers, consistent with the need for expedition and proportionality. The approach taken has been to consider a representative sample of standard form business interruption policies in the light of agreed and assumed facts. It is estimated that, in addition to the particular policies chosen for the test case, some 700 types of policies across over 60 different insurers and 370,000 policyholders could potentially be affected by the outcome of this litigation.</a></p><a name="para3">

These have been referred to for convenience as:</a></p><a name="para4"> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Disease clauses” (clauses which, in general, provide cover for business interruption losses resulting from the occurrence of a notifiable disease, such as COVID-19, at or within a specified distance of the business premises);</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Prevention of access clauses” (clauses which, in general, provide cover for business interruption losses resulting from public authority intervention preventing or hindering access to, or use of, the business premises);</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Hybrid clauses” (clauses which combine the main elements of the disease and prevention of access clauses); and</p>

In particular, the insurers argue that policyholders would have suffered the same or similar business interruption losses even if the insured risk or peril had not occurred, so that the claims fail because it cannot be said that the loss was caused by the insured peril and/or because of how the trends clauses require the loss to be quantified. In this regard there is a dispute between the parties about how the trends clauses operate. In support of their case, the insurers place considerable reliance upon the decision of the Commercial Court in <i>Orient-Express Hotels Ltd v Assicurazioni Generali SpA (trading as Generali Global Risk) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/1186.html">[2010] EWHC 1186 (Comm)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2010/1186.html">[2010] Lloyd's Rep IR 531</a>. This was an appeal from an arbitration award. As it happens, one of us was a member of the arbitral tribunal in that case (which comprised Sir Gordon Langley, Mr George Leggatt QC and Mr John O'Neill FCII) and the other of us (then Hamblen J) was the judge who decided the appeal. It will be necessary in the course of this judgment to consider whether that case was rightly decided.</p>

The core principle is that an insurance policy, like any other contract, must be interpreted objectively by asking what a reasonable person, with all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties when they entered into the contract, would have understood the language of the contract to mean. Evidence about what the parties subjectively intended or understood the contract to mean is not relevant to the court's task.</p>

The general nature of these clauses is that they provide insurance cover for business interruption loss caused by occurrence of a notifiable disease at or within a specified distance of the policyholder's business premises. The following policy wordings contain clauses of this kind: Argenta; MSA 1 and MSA 2; QBE 1, QBE 2 and QBE 3; and RSA 3. There are some variations among these wordings, though for reasons we will give none of the differences in our view materially alters the correct interpretation of the clauses.</a></p><a name="para48">

RSA 3 is a form of Commercial Combined policy which covers a variety of risks and was taken out by the owners of various different businesses, including building contractors, landscape gardeners and manufacturers and wholesalers of electronics, fabrics and metal goods. The policy has nine sections which provide different types of insurance cover. Section 2 provides cover for business interruption.</a></p><a name="para49">

However, section 2 also contains a series of “extensions” which provide cover for business interruption that is not consequent on physical damage to property. The critical extension for present purposes is Extension vii headed “Infectious Diseases”. This states (with the key words emphasised):</a></p><a name="para50">

First, it is agreed that by 6 March 2020 COVID-19 had been designated in all parts of the United Kingdom as a disease which fell within the description in limb (ii) of the definition of a “Notifiable Disease” quoted above. The obligation to notify cases or suspected cases of certain diseases to the relevant local authority is not in fact (as the wording of the definition would suggest) a matter of stipulation by the local authority but, as mentioned earlier, is imposed by legislation. Nevertheless, a reasonable reader of the insurance policy who wanted to know whether a particular disease fell within limb (ii) of the definition of a “Notifiable Disease” would understand it as intended to refer to those diseases which are classified as “notifiable diseases” by the 2010 Regulations (and equivalent legislation for other parts of the UK). Second, in order for illness resulting from COVID-19 to be “sustained by any person” within the meaning of the “Notifiable Disease” definition, the court below found that it is not necessary for the person concerned to have been diagnosed as having the disease or to have manifested symptoms of illness: it is sufficient that the person should in fact have contracted the disease, whether or not the disease is symptomatic or has been diagnosed. The manifestation of symptoms and the making of a diagnosis are therefore relevant only to questions of proof. There is no challenge to that finding. Third, it is common ground that the word “following” at the end of the opening words of the insuring clause does not mean merely “later in time than” but requires there to be a causal connection between one of the perils specified in (a) to (d) and the interruption to the policyholder's business. There is a dispute about the precise nature of the required causal connection, to which we will return later in this judgment when we address questions of causation.</a></p><a name="para53"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The two central issues</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two main issues about how the disease clause in RSA 3 should be interpreted. The first is what is meant by the words in (a)(iii) of the insuring clause: </a><a name="_Hlk57644472">“any … occurrence of a Notifiable Disease within a radius of 25 miles of the Premises”</a>. What is the scope of the peril insured against by this provision? RSA contends that the clause only covers the business interruption consequences of any cases of a Notifiable Disease which occur within a radius of 25 miles of the premises insured under the policy; any cases of disease which occur outside that area do not form part of the insured peril. The FCA's position, on the other hand, is that the clause should be read as covering the business interruption consequences of a Notifiable Disease wherever the disease occurs, provided it occurs (meaning that there is at least one case of illness caused by the disease) within the 25-mile radius. The second issue, which has to be approached in the light of the answer given to the first, is what causal link between the insured peril and interruption to the business is required in order to entitle the policyholder to be indemnified under this clause.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The decision of the court below</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="_Hlk57644324"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court below </a>accepted the FCA's case on the first issue and held that RSA 3 provides cover for the business interruption consequences of a Notifiable Disease which has occurred, ie of which there has been at least one instance, within the specified radius, from the time of that occurrence (see para 102 of the judgment).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching that conclusion, the court attached particular importance to two matters, which it described as fundamental. The first is that the words of the clause do not confine cover to a situation where the interruption to the business has resulted <u>only</u> from cases of a Notifiable Disease within the 25-mile radius, as opposed to other cases elsewhere.</a></p><a name="para56"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second matter is the nature of a “Notifiable Disease”, as defined in the policy. The court noted that the list of notifiable diseases in Schedule 1 to the 2010 Regulations includes diseases such as cholera, plague, typhus, yellow fever and SARS which are capable of spreading rapidly and widely. The list is also open-ended in that if at any time a new disease emerges as a threat to public health, it may be added to the list, as COVID-19 has been. An outbreak of such a disease could potentially affect a wide area and cause interruption to businesses over a wide area - a risk clearly contemplated by the policy, which recognises that the occurrence of a notifiable disease up to 25 miles away might lead to interruption of business at the insured premises. The parties must also have contemplated that the authorities would be likely to take action in response to an outbreak of a notifiable disease as a whole, and not to particular parts of an outbreak, and that it would be irrelevant to any action taken whether cases fell within or outside a line 25 miles away from the insured premises.</a></p><a name="para57"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of these matters, the court thought that it would not make sense for the cover in Extension vii(a)(iii) of RSA 3 to be confined to the effects only of the local occurrence of a Notifiable Disease. That would mean that there would be no effective cover if the local occurrence were a part of a wider outbreak and where, precisely because of the wider outbreak, it would be difficult or impossible to show that the local occurrence made a difference to the reaction of the authorities and/or the public. In the court's view, a reasonable person would not understand the parties in using the words they did to intend such unreasonable results and would read the clause as intended to cover the effects of a Notifiable Disease of which there is an occurrence within the specified radius.</a></p><a name="para58"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this interpretation, as the court put it at para 110 of the judgment: “the issues as to causation largely answer themselves.” The court considered that, whatever the exact nature of the causal relation required by the word “following”, the requirement is satisfied in circumstances where there has been a national response to a widespread outbreak of a disease across the country. The court's preferred analysis was that the cause of the business interruption “is the Notifiable Disease of which the individual outbreaks form indivisible parts” (see para 111 of the judgment). Alternatively, although the court regarded this analysis as less satisfactory, each of the individual occurrences of the disease was a separate but equally effective cause of the business interruption (para 112).</a></p><a name="para59">

<p class="ParaHeading">The meaning of the words used</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court below did not spell out in its judgment precisely how, as a matter of the English language, it considered that the words “<u>any</u> … <u>occurrence</u> of a Notifiable Disease <u>within</u> a radius of 25 miles of the Premises” can be read as meaning “a Notifiable Disease <u>of which there is any occurrence within</u> a radius of 25 miles of the Premises” (our emphasis). It has not been suggested that this is one of those rare situations in which the court can be satisfied that, in Lord Hoffmann's phrase, “something must have gone wrong with the language” and can engage in verbal rearrangement or correction of the words used in identifying what must have been meant: see <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/28.html">[1998] 1 WLR 896</a>, 913; <i>Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/38.html">[2009] UKHL 38</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/38.html">[2009] AC 1101</a>, para 25. If there were no obvious meaning of the words used and they were reasonably capable of bearing more than one possible meaning, the considerations mentioned at paras 56-57 above which influenced the court below would have been relevant in determining which meaning is to be preferred: see <i>Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/50.html">[2011] UKSC 50</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/50.html">[2011] 1 WLR 2900</a>, paras 21-30. But we do not consider that there is any ambiguity in the description of the relevant insured peril. No reasonable reader of the policy would understand the words “any … occurrence of a Notifiable Disease <u>within</u> a radius of 25 miles …” to include any occurrence of a Notifiable Disease <u>outside</u> a radius of 25 miles. To seek to interpret the language of the policy as bearing such a meaning is to stand the clause on its head.</p>

An outbreak might extend well beyond the 25-mile radius of the insured premises and potentially, as has happened with COVID-19, across the entire country. On this reading of the clause, provided the outbreak is present within the 25-mile radius, the whole outbreak (or “occurrence”) is covered.</a></p><a name="para63"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It should be said that this is in fact a different interpretation from the one accepted by the court below. On a fair reading of the judgment we think it clear that the court regarded the insured peril as the disease itself - that is to say in this case COVID-19 - and not a particular outbreak of the disease. If there were any doubt about that, it is dispelled by the declarations made by the court in its formal order dated 2 October 2020. Thus, Declaration 29.2, which records the court's decision as to the correct interpretation of the disease clause in RSA 3, states that:</a></p><a name="para64"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… there is cover under RSA 3 for any business interruption which an insured can show resulted from COVID-19 … from the date when the disease occurred in the relevant 25 mile radius of the insured premises.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">This does not treat the insured peril as limited to any occurrence or outbreak of COVID-19. It treats the insured peril simply as COVID-19, wherever and whenever the disease occurs without any geographical or temporal limits except for requirements (a) that there is an occurrence within the relevant 25 mile radius of the insured premises and (b) that the cover runs from the date of that local occurrence.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interpretation for which the FCA contends has the advantage that it bears a closer relationship to what the policy actually says and recognises that what is covered is not a Notifiable Disease as such but an “occurrence” of a Notifiable Disease which satisfies the relevant description. Nevertheless, it still seems to us to involve an attempt to re-write the wording of the policy, as what the clause says is not that there is cover for an occurrence <u>some part of which</u> is within the specified 25 mile radius but that there is cover for “any … occurrence of a Notifiable Disease within” that radius. In other words, it is only an occurrence within the specified area that is an insured peril and not anything that occurs outside that area.</a></p><a name="para65">

Nor for that matter could an “outbreak” of disease be regarded as one occurrence, unless the individual cases of disease described as an “outbreak” have a sufficient degree of unity in relation to time, locality and cause. If several members of a household were all infected with COVID-19 when a carrier of the disease visited their home on a particular day, that might arguably be described as one occurrence. But the same could not be said of the contraction of the disease by different individuals on different days in different towns and from different sources. Still less could it be said that all the cases of COVID-19 in England (or in the United Kingdom or throughout the world) which had arisen by any given date in March 2020 constituted one occurrence. On any reasonable or realistic view, those cases comprised thousands of separate occurrences of COVID-19. Some of those occurrences of the disease may have been within a radius of 25 miles of the insured premises whereas others undoubtedly will not have been. The interpretation which makes best sense of the clause, in our view, is to regard each case of illness sustained by an individual as a separate occurrence. On this basis there is no difficulty in principle and unlikely in most instances to be difficulty in practice in determining whether a particular occurrence was within or outside the specified geographical area.</a></p><a name="para69">

The definition makes it clear that the term “Notifiable Disease” does not in fact, contrary to what might otherwise be supposed, refer to a disease in any general sense. Rather, it refers to “illness sustained by any person resulting from” a human infectious or human contagious disease provided that the disease is one “an outbreak of which the competent local authority has stipulated shall be notified to them”. This provides yet further demonstration that the insured peril is not the disease generally nor an “outbreak” of the disease. The reference to an “outbreak” functions only as part of the </a><a name="_Hlk57226424">description </a>which a disease must satisfy in order to fall within limb (ii) of the definition. Where a disease satisfies that description, it is not the outbreak nor the disease itself which constitutes a “Notifiable Disease”, but illness sustained by any person resulting from that disease.</p>

As a matter of plain language, the clause covers only cases of illness resulting from COVID-19 that occur within the 25-mile radius specified in the clause. That is consistent with the other sub-clauses of the extension. In each case they cover events (or the discovery of events) that occur “at the premises”, that is to say at a particular time and place. They include in (a)(i) any “occurrence of a Notifiable Disease (as defined below) at the Premises”. The FCA has not sought to suggest that this sub-clause provides cover for all the business interruption consequences of a Notifiable Disease, wherever in the country or the world it occurs, provided that (and from the time when) there is at least one case of the disease at the premises. The language of the policy is not reasonably capable of bearing that meaning. By the same token and for similar reasons, the interpretation which the FCA has sought to place on sub-clause (a)(iii) is not in our view a tenable reading of the policy wording.</a></p><a name="para71">

That is an important point when considering questions of causation.

Counsel for RSA invoke the principle that a court, when confronted with two provisions in a contract that seem to be inconsistent with each other, should start from the premise that the parties intended that effect should be given to each of the two provisions and must do its best to reconcile them if that can conscientiously and fairly be achieved: see eg <i>Pagnan SpA v Tradax Ocean Transportation SA</i> [1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep 646, 653; [1987] 1 All ER 81, 89 (Steyn J), affirmed by the Court of Appeal at [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 342; [1987] 3 All ER 565; <i>Taylor v Rive Droite Music Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/1300.html">[2005] EWCA Civ 1300</a>, paras 23, 27 and 40; and <i>Geys v Société Générale</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/63.html">[2012] UKSC 63</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/63.html">[2013] 1 AC 523</a>, para 24 (Lord Hope of Craighead). On behalf of RSA, Mr David Turner QC submits that the disease extension in section 2 and General Exclusion L should accordingly be interpreted, so far as possible, in a way which gives effect to both clauses. He accepts that this is not possible in the case of the reference in the general exclusion to “disease” in circumstances where, if read as applicable to the disease clause in the business interruption section of the policy, it would altogether negate the cover provided by that clause. He also accepts that the exclusion of “poisoning” in General Exclusion L cannot easily be reconciled with the provision of cover under the disease extension for “food or drink poisoning”. However, he submits that effect can and should be given to the word “epidemic” by construing the disease clause as providing cover for the consequences of any occurrence of a notifiable disease (within the specified radius) only if the occurrence is not part of an “epidemic”.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77">77.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court below saw no merit in this argument and nor do we. The assumption that the parties intended each of two seemingly inconsistent clauses in their agreement to have effect is a sound starting point where the parties to the contract would reasonably be expected to have had both clauses simultaneously in mind. The cases cited by RSA were all cases of this kind. But sometimes that is not a reasonable assumption - for example in the case of complex contractual documents which themselves contemplate and provide for the possibility of inconsistency. In any event, the overriding question is how the words of the contract would be understood by a reasonable person. In the case of an insurance policy of the present kind, sold principally to SMEs, the person to whom the document should be taken to be addressed is not a pedantic lawyer who will subject the entire policy wording to a minute textual analysis (cf <i>Jumbo King Ltd v Faithful Properties Ltd</i> </a><a href="http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/1999/38.html">(1999) 2 HKCFAR 279</a>, para <a href="http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/1999/38.html#p59">59</a>). It is an ordinary policyholder who, on entering into the contract, is taken to have read through the policy conscientiously in order to understand what cover they were getting.</p>

The reasonable reader would naturally assume that, if the intention had been to put a further substantive limit on the risk of business interruption specifically insured by the extension for infectious diseases in addition to the geographical and temporal limits stated in the extension itself, this would have been done transparently as part of the wording of the extension and not buried away in the middle of a general exclusion of contamination and pollution risks at the back of the policy. The reference in the exclusion to “disease” would reinforce the understanding that the general exclusion could not have been intended to apply to the cover for business interruption caused by an infectious disease, as it would obliterate that cover. It could not sensibly be thought to make a difference that the word “disease” was part of a composite phrase “disease and epidemic”. No reasonable reader would suppose that, although one part of this phrase was not intended to apply to the business interruption cover, the other part was.</a></p><a name="para78">

In MSA 1 and MSA 2 the peril is described as “any notifiable disease within a radius of 25 miles of the premises”. Although the word “occurrence” is not used in the MSA wordings, the term “notifiable disease” is so far as relevant defined in the same way as in RSA 3. That definition accordingly makes it clear that the insured peril is not a disease as such but individual cases of “illness sustained by any person resulting from” a relevant disease. There is no justification for interpreting any of these clauses differently from the disease clause in RSA 3; nor did we understand any party to contend that there is any relevant distinction between any of these wordings and that of RSA 3.</a></p><a name="para82">

Another difference from RSA 3 is that this wording refers not to “illness sustained by any person” but to a disease “manifested by any person”. The court below interpreted the word “manifested” to require that the person concerned must either have displayed symptoms of the disease or have been diagnosed as having the disease (for example by means of a test). That aspect of the court's interpretation is not disputed. However, consistently with its interpretation of RSA 3, the court rejected QBE's contention that the words “manifested by any person whilst in the premises or within a twenty five (25) mile radius of it” mean that the insured peril is limited to any cases of the disease which are manifested within the 25 mile radius. Instead, the court considered that those words are most naturally read, and should be construed, as “an adjectival clause limiting the class of notifiable diseases which, if they interfere with the business, will lead to coverage” (see para 226 of the judgment).</a></p><a name="para84">

Nevertheless, we think the wording makes it sufficiently clear that the insured peril is not any notifiable disease occurring anywhere in the world but only in so far as it is manifested by any person whilst in the premises or within a 25 mile radius of the premises. The words “manifested by any person” etc are indeed, as the court below described them “adjectival”. But that does not detract from the fact that they are an integral part of the description of the risk. They are adjectival but not conditional. We do not agree that the clause is naturally or reasonably read as if it said: “any human infectious or human contagious disease … <u>on condition that and from the time when the disease is</u> manifested by any person whilst in the premises or within a 25 mile radius of it.”</a></p><a name="para85">

It also involves treating the insured peril as subject to no geographical limit at all provided only that at least one person manifests the disease within the specified area. That seems to us an improbable form of cover for insurers to provide, as well as one which would be out of line with all the other limbs of the clause. Each of the other sub-clauses covers something happening at, or a consequence of something happening at, the insured premises: for example, injury or illness sustained by any person arising from food or drink provided in the premises; or the presence of vermin or pests in the premises. Sub-clause (a) is naturally understood as operating in a similar way. The only difference from the other sub-clauses is that the risk covered is not confined solely to something happening at the insured premises but extends to something happening within a specified distance away from the insured premises. Thus, it is not only disease manifested by any person whilst in the premises that is covered, but also disease manifested by any person whilst within a 25-mile radius of the premises.</a></p><a name="para86">

First, the list of insured perils in the clause is not preceded by the word “following” but by the words “in consequence of any of the following events” (and the word “event” is also used in the definition of the “indemnity period”). Second, the term “incident” is used in several places, apparently as a synonym for the term “event”.</a></p><a name="para91">

The court said (at para 231 of the judgment):</a></p><a name="para92"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Given the reference to ‘events', and taken with the nature of the other matters referred to in (a), (b) and (d) to (f), the emphasis in (c) appears to us in this clause not to be on the fact that the disease has occurred within 25 miles, but on the particular occurrences of the disease within the 25 miles. It is the ‘event' which is constituted by the occurrence(s) of the disease within the 25-mile radius which must have caused the business interruption or interference.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The court also considered that uses of the word “incident” in (h) and (i) “reinforce the fact that the clause is concerned with specific events, limited in time and place”.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with these observations but cannot accept that the terms “event” and “incident” are necessary to make it clear that what is covered by the clause is any occurrence(s) of a notifiable disease within the 25 miles. That is already plain from the description of the insured peril as “any occurrence of a notifiable disease within a radius of 25 miles of the premises”. We do not perceive any difference in meaning between the terms “occurrence” and “event”, and nothing significant is added by the use of the word “incident” as a compendious term instead of the phrase “occurrence discovery or accident” used, for example, in the definition of the indemnity period in RSA 3. Furthermore, the other matters referred to in (a), (b) and (d) to (f) in clause 3.2.4 of QBE 2 are exactly the same as those referred to in the corresponding sub-clauses in RSA 3, and the nature of those matters confirms equally in both cases that the clause is concerned with the consequences of particular events occurring at a particular time and place. Yet further, the definition of a “notifiable disease” in QBE 2 is identical to the definition of that term in RSA 3 and, as discussed earlier, makes it clear that it is not the disease itself but particular cases of illness sustained by a person resulting from a relevant disease which constitutes the insured peril.</a></p><a name="para93">

It has not been suggested by either party that this difference justifies adopting a different analysis of the clause. We agree with the conclusion of the court below that “this clause too is confining cover to the consequences of certain happenings, in particular specific occurrences of the disease within the radius, as opposed to other happenings or events, including instances of people contracting the disease outside the radius” (see para 237 of the judgment).</a></p><a name="para94">

An issue common to the insurers' appeals is how the question whether loss has been caused by an insured peril should be analysed and, in particular, how the causal connections between the different elements of the clause interact with each other in determining what loss is covered by the clause. This issue is addressed in the later sections of this judgment, where we also consider the effect of the trends clause.</a></p><a name="para97">

The relevant element of the peril insured against by these clauses is:</a></p><a name="para102">

As discussed, each individual case of disease is in our view properly regarded as an occurrence. Accordingly, where there are multiple cases of disease, each is an “occurrence” within the meaning of the clause. If the intention had been to restrict the scope of the clause to any occurrence(s) of disease at or near the insured premises, the clause would have said so. Apart from the simple fact that the clause contains no such words of restriction, the interpretation contended for by Hiscox would make its application highly uncertain. Just how local, limited or small-scale does an outbreak of disease have to be to fall within the scope of the cover? On the case advanced by Hiscox, the policy provides no answer to that question. Yet no reasonable insurer would leave the answer to that question at large. As can be seen from Hiscox 4 and all the disease clause wordings, where insurers are only willing to cover consequences of an occurrence of a notifiable disease which is local to the insured premises, they specify the requisite distance in the clause.</a></p><a name="para104">

An issue raised on the FCA's appeal and by the Hiscox Interveners is whether the court below was correct to hold that the words “restrictions imposed” mean something which is both expressed in mandatory terms and has the force of law. On this basis the court held that the only relevant matters which constituted “restrictions imposed” are those which were promulgated by statutory instrument, and in particular regulation 2 of the 21 March Regulations and regulations 4 and 5 of the 26 March Regulations (see paras 266-267 of the judgment).

They are, first of all, that the natural meaning of the word “imposed” is something which is mandatory. Furthermore:</a></p><a name="para112"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… these words are used in the context of a resulting inability on the part of the insured to use its own premises. That reinforces the conclusion that what is being referred to is something that has the force of law. Each of paragraphs (a) to (e) of the ‘public authorities' clause … is a case in which mandatory action can be taken by relevant authorities in respect of premises under identifiable legal or statutory powers, and the reference to ‘restrictions imposed' most naturally refers to the legally binding powers that can be exercised in relation to those situations.”</p>

The FCA also contends that the court's interpretation is unrealistic and uncommercial. It submits that where, for example, a public authority directs businesses to close in mandatory terms that clearly expect immediate compliance, it is unrealistic to treat the restrictions as not being “imposed” simply because they do not have legally binding force. Such an interpretation also places an unrealistic and uncommercial onus on policyholders by requiring them to analyse the legal basis of a public authority's instructions before complying with them in order to know whether the consequences of doing so will be covered by their insurance. Further, the court's interpretation creates the anomalous prospect that a socially responsible policyholder who complies voluntarily with the instruction of a public authority may be put in a significantly worse position than one who refuses to comply unless the instruction is given legally binding force.</a></p><a name="para113">

They stress that the Hiscox policies are meant to be readily understandable by unsophisticated, small businesses. A policyholder would reasonably understand that Government instructions expressed in mandatory terms, such as the mandatory directions given by the Prime Minister to the British public on national television on 16, 20 and 23 March 2020, are required to be complied with without first undertaking inquiries into their legal basis. They submit that a reasonable person listening to the Prime Minister's announcements would not consider that they were being given a choice as to whether or not to comply with the directions given, which thus amounted to “restrictions imposed”.</a></p><a name="para115">

We would not, however, accept that a restriction must always have the force of law before it can fall within this description.</a></p><a name="para116">

All concerned would expect such an instruction to be complied with forthwith, regardless of legalities, and would regard the “restriction” as being “imposed” there and then.</a></p><a name="para118">

The court accepted that this would extend to a closure which is legally capable of being enforced and would include a case where “a governmental authority or agency or local authority directs that particular premises should be closed, and states that if they are not closed then a compulsory order for their closure will be obtained”.</a></p><a name="para119">

When the Prime Minister in his statement of 20 March 2020 instructed named businesses to close “tonight”, that was a clear, mandatory instruction given on behalf of the UK Government. It was an instruction which both the named businesses and the public would reasonably understand had to be complied with without inquiring into the legal basis or anticipated legal basis for the instruction. We consider that such an instruction is capable of being a “restriction imposed”, regardless of whether it was legally capable of being enforced.</a></p><a name="para120">

The line between what is permitted and what is legally prohibited is, in general, clear. That between whether or not an “objectively reasonable person” (Hiscox Interveners) or a “reasonable impartial observer” (FCA) would interpret an announcement as being “mandatory” is less so. Nevertheless, the test in interpreting the words used is how they would be understood by a reasonable person and we do not consider that a reasonable policyholder would understand the word “imposed”, without more, as making cover conditional on the existence or immediate prospect of a valid legal basis for the restriction. In particular, we consider that an instruction given by a public authority may amount to a “restriction imposed” if, from the terms and context of the instruction, compliance with it is required, and would reasonably be understood to be required, without the need for recourse to legal powers. This is likely to arise only in situations of emergency, as in the present case. Such an instruction would need not only to be in mandatory terms, but also in clear enough terms to enable the addressee to know with reasonable certainty what compliance requires.</a></p><a name="para121">

It is unnecessary, however, to address this issue separately or specifically in relation to clauses where the issue is academic because the court below held that, for other reasons, the clause does not cover losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and there has been no challenge to that decision on this appeal. Clauses which fall in this category are: the “Non-damage denial of access” clauses in Hiscox 1, 2 and 4; the “Action of competent authorities” clauses in MSA 1 and Zurich 1 and 2; and the “Prevention of access - non-damage clause” in MSA 2.</a></p><a name="para122">

We do, however, agree with the court's conclusion in relation to RSA 4 that an “enforced closure of an Insured Location” would not include “advice or exhortations, or social distancing and stay at home instructions” (para 303).</a></p><a name="para124">

Regulation 6 prohibited people from leaving their homes without reasonable excuse.

The court's police cordon example is relevant as an illustration of an inability to use the premises resulting not from a restriction directed at the premises or their use by the policyholder, but from a restriction which keeps the public out.

On the other hand, we do not accept that the inability has to be an inability to use any part of the premises for any business purpose. The reference to “the business premises” is naturally read as including a discrete part of those premises which is capable of being used separately from other parts. Such an interpretation also makes commercial sense, as there may be little difference from a business point of view between the ability to use a small part of the premises for a limited purpose and closure of the whole premises. Furthermore, the language of the clause does not require there to be a complete inability to use the premises for all purposes. The court below appears to have accepted this, as it refers in the passage quoted above to “a complete inability to use the premises <u>for the purposes of the business</u>” (our emphasis). We agree that a qualification of this kind is implicit in the clause but again see no reason why different business purposes should not be distinguished if the relevant activities are capable of being conducted separately.</a></p><a name="para136">

Having accepted that there could be “restrictions imposed” which were not directed specifically at the policyholder or its use of the premises, the court went on to say (at para 270 of the judgment) that the restrictions on leaving home imposed by regulation 6 could not be said to have led to an “inability to use” the premises of all policyholders where the business had relied on the physical presence of customers. As the court explained:</a></p><a name="para142"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… ‘inability to use' premises means what it says and is not to be equated with hindrance or disruption to normal use.

The court considered (at paras 326-327 of the judgment) an example of a restaurant which in addition to in-restaurant dining offers a takeaway collection or delivery service. Regulation 4 of the 26 March Regulations required the closure during the emergency period of any premises, or part of the premises, in which food or drink were sold for consumption on those premises; but it did not require the premises to close to the extent that they were used for the purposes of providing a takeaway service. The court considered that, while it could be said that the restaurant owner policyholder and its employees were impeded or hindered in their use of the premises because they could not operate the restaurant for in-house dining, the government action did not cause prevention of access, as they were not prevented from accessing the premises for the purposes of carrying on that part of the existing business which involved providing the takeaway service. By contrast, the court accepted that if the restaurant did not previously offer a takeaway service but started one during lockdown, the position would be different. In such circumstances there would be prevention of access for the purposes of the business as it had existed when the insurance policy was issued.</a></p><a name="para148">

Mr John Lockey QC for Arch suggests that there is a significant difference between the clause in the Arch wording and the public authority clause in Hiscox 1-4 because the Arch wording focuses on access to the premises rather than use of the premises. Access refers to the means of entry to the premises. If the premises can be entered for the purpose of carrying on the business there, then there has been no prevention of access.</a></p><a name="para149">

As Mr Lockey accepts, the prevention of access does not have to be physical so that if, for example, the policyholder was able to and did enter the premises to carry out essential maintenance, that would not mean that the clause does not apply if access was prevented by law for the purposes of carrying on the business. Once, however, it is conceded - as is inevitable - that continued access to the premises for some purposes is compatible with there being cover, the question becomes: for what purposes? Furthermore, there is again no good reason to construe “the premises” as referring only to the entire premises rather than as encompassing part of the premises.</a></p><a name="para150">

We agree with Arch that prevention means stopping something from happening or making an intended act impossible and is different from mere hindrance. In both the situations contemplated, however, access to a discrete part of the premises or access to the premises for a discrete purpose will have been completely stopped from happening.</a></p><a name="para151">

The distinction drawn by Arch, and accepted by the court below, between continuing to operate such a service (where it is said that there would be no prevention of access or inability to use the premises) and starting a new takeaway service after closing the restaurant for dining is an unsatisfactory and arbitrary distinction. It is also illogical. If the premises can be put to such use, then it can be said that there is an ability to use them and that access to the premises for the purposes of carrying on the policyholder's business is not prevented. A more realistic view is that there is prevention of access to (and inability to use) a discrete part of the premises, namely the dining area of the restaurant, and prevention of access to (and inability to use) the premises for the discrete business activity of providing a dining in service.</a></p><a name="para152">

In essence, the court held that the restrictions on free movement imposed by regulation 6 did not in themselves prevent access to premises which remained open; and to the extent that, in consequence of the regulation, fewer people went to the relevant shop or office or only did so for the purposes of buying essential supplies or transacting business which could not be carried out remotely from home, this amounted to hindrance in the use of the premises but not to “prevention of access to The Premises”.</a></p><a name="para153">

As the court below stressed, a prevention needs to be established; hindrance does not suffice. We agree with the court below that the Prime Minister's statement of 16 March 2020 did not cause prevention of access to the relevant insured business premises for the reasons given at para 328 of the judgment.</a></p><a name="para154">

<p class="ParaHeading">The meaning of “interruption”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para157">157.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Hiscox has raised a point about the meaning of the term “interruption” in the Hiscox wordings quoted at para 111 above, which refer to losses resulting from “an interruption to your activities …” The court below held that “interruption” in this context meant “business interruption generally” and included interference or disruption, not just a complete cessation of the policyholder's business or activities (see paras 274 and 409-414 of the judgment). Hiscox disputes this conclusion, renewing its argument made below that the term “interruption” naturally means a stop or break and is different from “interference”, which refers to circumstances where something continues but cannot be carried on properly. Alternatively, it is said that the term “interruption” must involve a more demanding test than “interference” and cannot extend to any kind of disruption, however slight.</a></p><a name="para157">

The ordinary meaning of “interruption” is quite capable of encompassing interference or disruption which does not bring about a complete cessation of business or activities, and which may even be slight (although it will only be relevant if it has a material effect on the financial performance of the business). Furthermore, the possibility that interruption may be partial is inherent in the policy provisions which deal with the calculation of loss and which envisage that the business may continue operating during a period of interruption but with reduced income or increased costs of working. In addition, as the court below pointed out (at paras 409-414 of the judgment), the policies contain a number of heads of cover for perils causing “interruption to your activities” which are plainly intended to apply in circumstances where there is only limited interruption and not a complete cessation of activities. Examples given included clauses covering interruption caused by loss of attraction by reason of damage in the vicinity of the premises and interruption caused by damage at the premises of a particular customer or supplier.</a></p><a name="para158">

That is because, if the insured peril is COVID-19 (from the date when a case of the disease occurs within the specified distance of the insured premises), it follows that, from the date when such a case occurs, the policy covers all effects of COVID-19 on the policyholder's business. It is not in dispute that the measures taken by the Government in response to the disease and the business interruption consequent on those measures were caused by COVID-19 whatever the precise nature of the required causal link. </a><a name="_Hlk57885873">It makes no difference for these purposes whether the occurrence of the disease within the specified area is seen as part of an indivisible cause, constituted by COVID-19 (the analysis preferred by the court below), or whether each of the individual cases of the disease is treated as a separate but equally effective cause of the actions taken by the Government and ensuing business interruption (the court's alternative analysis).</a></p>

We have concluded that the clauses cover only the effects of cases of COVID-19 occurring within the specified radius of the insured premises. On this basis, the question of what connection must be shown between any such cases of disease and the business interruption loss for which an insurance claim is made becomes critical.</a></p><a name="para161">

This may be illustrated by the variety of phrases used in the sample wordings in the present case. We noted earlier that RSA 3 uses the word “following” to describe the required connection between occurrence of a notifiable disease and interruption of the business. So do MSA 1 and MSA 2. In the Argenta wording the phrase used is “as a result of”. In QBE 1, it is “arising from”; and in QBE 2 and QBE 3, it is “in consequence of”. We do not think it profitable to search for shades of semantic difference between these phrases. Sometimes the policy language may indicate that a looser form of causal connection will suffice than would normally be required, such as use of the words “directly or indirectly caused by …”: see eg <i>Coxe v Employers' Liability Assurance Corpn Ltd</i> [1916] 2 KB 629. The same may arguably be said in the present case of the word “following”. But it is rare for the test of causation to turn on such nuances. Although the question whether loss has been caused by an insured peril is a question of interpretation of the policy, it is not (unlike the questions of interpretation of the disease, hybrid and prevention of access clauses considered above) a question which depends to any great extent on matters of linguistic meaning and how the words used would be understood by an ordinary member of the public. What is at issue is the legal effect of the insurance contract, as applied to a particular factual situation.</a></p><a name="para162">

This is codified in section 55(1) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, which states that:</a></p><a name="para163"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer is liable for any loss proximately caused by a peril insured against, but, subject as aforesaid, he is not liable for any loss which is not proximately caused by a peril insured against.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para163">Like other provisions of the 1906 Act, this is treated by the courts as also stating the law applicable to non-marine insurance. As is clear from the words “unless the policy otherwise provides,” however, the rule is not inflexible. The requirement of “proximate” causation is based on the presumed intention of the contracting parties: see <i>Reischer v Borwick</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1894/134.html">[1894] 2 QB 548</a>, 550; <i>Leyland Shipping Co Ltd v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Ltd</i> [1918] AC 350, 365 (Lord Atkinson); <i>Becker, Gray &amp; Co v London Assurance Corpn</i> [1918] AC 101, 113-114 (Lord Sumner).

As Lord Sumner observed in <i>Becker, Gray &amp; Co</i> at p 114: “It would be the better for a little plain English.” The term originates from Sir Francis Bacon's Maxims of the Law (1596). His first maxim (Regula I) was “In jure non remota causa sed proxima spectatur”, which may be translated as “In law, it is not the remote cause but the near cause that is looked to”. Bacon's explanation was that:</a></p><a name="para164"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It were infinite for the law to judge the cause of causes, and their impulsions one of another; therefore it contenteth itself with the immediate cause, and judgeth of the acts by that, without looking to any further degree.”</p>

Ultimately, this concept supplanted the idea that the law is concerned with the immediate cause of loss, although in insurance law the expression “proximate cause” was retained. An important case in cementing this development was the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Reischer v Borwick</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1894/134.html">[1894] 2 QB 548</a>. This concerned a claim under a marine insurance policy which covered loss or damage from collision with any object, but not loss from perils of the sea. The ship collided with an object floating in a river, which caused a leak. The ship was anchored and the leak temporarily repaired. A tug was sent to tow the ship to the nearest dock but, while the ship was being towed, the effect of the motion through the water was that the leak was re-opened and the ship began to sink. To save the lives of the crew, the ship was then run aground and abandoned. The Court of Appeal held that, notwithstanding the intervening events, the loss of the ship was proximately caused by the collision and was therefore covered by the policy.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para166">166.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This decision was approved by the House of Lords in the leading case of <i>Leyland Shipping Ltd v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Ltd</i> [1918] AC 350. The facts were materially similar to those of <i>Reischer v Borwick</i>. A ship torpedoed by a German submarine was towed to the nearest port but had to anchor in the outer harbour exposed to the wind and waves. After three days the ship sank. The ship was insured against perils of the sea but there was an exception in the policy for “all consequences of hostilities or warlike operations”. The House of Lords affirmed the decision of the lower courts that the loss was proximately caused by the torpedo, which was a consequence of hostilities, and was therefore not covered by the insurance. By far the fullest discussion of the concept of proximate cause is contained in the speech of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline. He made it clear, first of all, that the test of causation is a matter of interpretation of the policy and that “[t]he true and the overruling principle is to look at a contract as a whole and to ascertain what the parties to it really meant” (see p 369). He went on to say:</a></p><a name="para166"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“What does ‘proximate' here mean? To treat proximate cause as if it was the cause which is proximate in time is … out of the question. The cause which is truly proximate is that which is proximate in efficiency. That efficiency may have been preserved although other causes may meantime have sprung up which have yet not destroyed it, or truly impaired it, and it may culminate in a result of which it still remains the real efficient cause to which the event can be ascribed.”</p>

This was the view expressed in <i>Leyland Shipping</i> by Lord Dunedin, who said (at p 362):</a></p><a name="para167"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I think the case turns on a pure question of fact to be determined by common-sense principles. What was the cause of the loss of the ship? I do not think the ordinary man would have any difficulty in answering she was lost because she was torpedoed.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The high water mark of this appeal to common sense is a passage that has often been quoted from the speech of Lord Wright in <i>Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co Ltd v Minister of War Transport</i> [1942] AC 691, 706:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This choice of the real or efficient cause from out of the whole complex of the facts must be made by applying common sense standards. Causation is to be understood as the man in the street, and not as either the scientist or the metaphysician, would understand it. Cause here means what a business or seafaring man would take to be the cause without too microscopic analysis but on a broad view.”</p>

It is not a matter of choosing a cause as proximate on the basis of an unguided gut feeling. The starting point for the inquiry is to identify, by interpreting the policy and considering the evidence, whether a peril covered by the policy had any causal involvement in the loss and, if so, whether a peril excluded or excepted from the scope of the cover also had any such involvement. The question whether the occurrence of such a peril was in either case the proximate (or “efficient”) cause of the loss involves making a judgment as to whether it made the loss inevitable - if not, which could seldom if ever be said, in all conceivable circumstances - then in the ordinary course of events. For this purpose, human actions are not generally regarded as negativing causal connection, provided at least that the actions taken were not wholly unreasonable or erratic.</a></p><a name="para168">

Those efforts merely delayed the occurrence of the loss. The leak was re-opened not as a result of any unusual weather conditions but simply through the ordinary motion of the water while the ship was under tow.</a></p><a name="para169">

This was found without difficulty to fall within what amounted to an exception for “all consequences of hostilities”. The question whether this was the proximate cause of the loss then essentially involved a judgment as to whether the torpedo damage led inexorably to the loss of the ship or whether anything that occurred between the time when the ship was struck by the torpedo and her subsequent loss was sufficiently abnormal to justify treating it as negativing the causal connection. The House of Lords considered that the answer to this was clear and that the subsequent events did not displace the damage inflicted by the torpedo as the proximate cause of the casualty.</a></p><a name="para170">

This case concerned a yacht insured against loss caused by “external accidental means”. The yacht sank as a result of what was held to be a combination of causes which were “equal, or at least nearly equal, in their efficiency” (per Slade LJ at p 40). They were adverse sea conditions and design defects which rendered the yacht unseaworthy. The first of these causes fell within the scope of the insurance; the other, unseaworthiness, did not but nor was it an excluded peril. The Court of Appeal held that in these circumstances the loss was proximately caused by a peril insured against and was therefore covered.

Thus, in the present case it obviously could not be said that any individual case of illness resulting from COVID-19, on its own, caused the UK Government to introduce restrictions which led directly to business interruption. However, as the court below </a><a name="_Hlk60315172">found, the Government measures were taken in response to information about all the cases of COVID-19 in the country as a whole</a>. We agree with the court below that it is realistic to analyse this situation as one in which “all the cases were equal causes of the imposition of national measures” (para 112).</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The “but for” test</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para177">177.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal ground on which the insurers resist this analysis is that it cannot be said that, <u>but for</u> any individual case of illness resulting from COVID-19, the Government measures would not have been taken. The insurers argue, as a central plank of their case on these appeals, that whatever the exact nature of the causal link required by each sample policy wording it is a minimum requirement of any causation test that the occurrence of the insured peril made a difference to the occurrence of loss: in other words, it is necessary to show, at a minimum, that the loss would not have been sustained but for the occurrence of the insured peril. Thus, MS Amlin, whose submissions on this issue were adopted by the other insurers, said in their written case:</a></p><a name="para177"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The basic, fundamental, threshold test for any factual causation inquiry is the ‘but for' test. X cannot be a cause of Y if Y would in any event have occurred irrespective of - but for - X.”</p>

In oral argument leading counsel for MS Amlin, Mr Gavin Kealey QC, sought to buttress this submission by the rhetorical use of emphasis and by pointing to the alleged failure of counsel for the FCA to find any insurance case which has held that a loss was caused by an insured peril that did not satisfy the “but for” test. Along with all the insurers' counsel, he also relied on the <i>Orient Express </i>case which we will consider later in this judgment.</a></p><a name="para178"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para178"></a><a name="para179">179.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the FCA has pointed out, the area described by the disease clauses which refer to a radius of 25 miles of the business premises is an area of a little under 2,000 square miles. To put this in perspective, this is bigger than any city in the UK, more than three times the size of Surrey, roughly the combined size of Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, and around a quarter of the area of Wales. The FCA produced a map to show that the whole of England can be covered, more or less, by just 20 circles each with a 25 mile radius. Nevertheless, if - as the insurers submit - the relevant test in considering the Government measures taken in March 2020 is to ask whether the Government would have acted in the same way on the counterfactual assumption that there were no cases </a><a name="_Hlk57889559">of COVID-19 </a>within 25 miles of the policyholder's premises but all the other cases elsewhere in the country had occurred as they in fact did, the answer must, in relation to any particular policy, be that it probably would have acted in the same way. As already mentioned, the court below found as a fact (at para 112 of the judgment) that the Government response was a reaction to information about all the cases of COVID-19 in the country and that the response was decided to be national because the outbreak was so widespread. In these circumstances it is unlikely that the existence of an enclave with a radius of 25 miles in any one particular area of the country which was so far free of COVID-19 would have led to that area being excepted from the national measures or otherwise have altered the Government's response to the epidemic. That in turn means that in the vast majority of cases it would be difficult if not impossible for a policyholder to prove that, but for cases of COVID-19 within a radius of 25 miles of the insured premises, the interruption to its business would have been less.</p>

For example, in <i>Wayne Tank</i> the conduct of an employee who negligently left equipment switched on and unattended overnight before it had been tested, which was a risk insured against, would not have led to a fire which burnt down the factory if the equipment had not been defective. Equally, the fire would not have occurred if the equipment had been switched off. Each cause therefore satisfied the “but for” test.</a></p><a name="para180">

The most conspicuous weakness of the “but for” test is not that it wrongly excludes cases in which there is a causal link, but that it fails to exclude a great many cases in which X would not be regarded as an effective or proximate cause of Y. If, for example, a cargo is lost when a ship sinks, an unlimited number of circumstances could be identified but for which the loss would not have occurred. These will include some which may be plausible candidates for selection as a proximate cause - for example, the unseaworthy state of the vessel or exceptionally severe weather conditions. But they will also include an endless number of other circumstances. For example, it might equally be said that the loss would not have occurred but for the decision to manufacture the vessel, the decision of the owner or charterer to deploy the vessel on this particular route, the buyer's decision to purchase the cargo and the seller's decision to ship the cargo on that particular vessel, and so on. The main inadequacy, in other words, of the “but for” test is not that it returns false negatives but that it returns a countless number of false positives. That explains why it is often - and for most purposes correctly - described as a minimum threshold test of causation.</a></p><a name="para181">

An example given by <i>Hart and Honoré</i> in their seminal treatise on <i>Causation in the Law</i>, 2nd ed (1985), p 206 is a case of two fires, started independently of each other, which combine to burn down a property: see <i>Minneapolis, St P &amp; S S M Ry Co</i>, 146 Minn 430, 179 NW 45 (1920); <i>Kingston v Chicago &amp; NW Ry Co</i> 191 Wis 610, 211 NW 913 (1927). It is natural to regard each fire as a cause of the loss even if either fire would by itself have destroyed the property so that it cannot be said of either fire that, but for that peril, the loss would not have occurred. Another example, adapted from the facts of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cook v Lewis</i> </a><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/21v58">[1951] SCR 830</a>, is a case where two hunters simultaneously shoot a hiker who is behind some bushes and medical evidence shows that either bullet would have killed the hiker instantly even if the other bullet had not been fired. Applying the “but for” test would produce the result that neither hunter's shot caused the hiker's death - a result which is manifestly not consistent with common-sense principles.</p>

Such cases are thus often described as cases in which the result is causally “over-determined” or “over-subscribed”. There is, however, a further class of cases in which a series of events combine to produce a particular result but where none of the individual events was either necessary or sufficient to bring about the result by itself. A number of examples are given by Professor Jane Stapleton in her scholarly work on causation in law: see most recently J Stapleton, “Unnecessary causes” (2013) 129 LQR 39; and “An ‘extended but for' test for the causal relation in the law of obligations” (2015) 35 OJLS 697.</a></p><a name="para183">

Assume it is shown that only, say, 13 or 14 people would have been needed to bring about that result. It could not then be said that the participation of any given individual was either necessary or sufficient to cause the destruction of the bus. Yet it seems appropriate to describe each person's involvement as a cause of the loss. Treating the “but for” test as a minimum threshold which must always be crossed if X is to be regarded as a cause of Y would again lead to the absurd conclusion that no one's actions caused the bus to be destroyed.</a></p><a name="para184">

Again, it cannot be said that any individual director's vote was either necessary or sufficient to cause the product to be marketed and yet it is reasonable to regard each vote as causative rather than to say that none of the votes caused the decision to be made. Another example is where multiple polluters discharge hazardous waste into a river. In all these cases each individual contribution is reasonably capable of being regarded as a cause of the harm that occurs, even though it was neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the harm by itself.</a></p><a name="para185">

In that case costs were incurred in defending a claim brought against a company director who was insured against “all loss … which such officer has become legally obligated to pay on account of any claims made against him/her … for a wrongful act.” The claim was also brought against another person who was not insured. Both defendants were represented by the same lawyers. The issue was whether the insured director was entitled to an indemnity for defence costs which related at one and the same time to the defence both of the claim against him and of the claim against the uninsured third person. The Privy Council held that on the correct interpretation of the policy he was. Although the words “on account of” clearly required there to be a causal connection between the loss (comprising defence costs) and the claim against the director for a wrongful act, the fact that the disputed costs would still have been incurred even if the director had not been legally obligated to pay them did not prevent their recovery. The wording did not confine the recoverable costs to those which related “solely and exclusively to the officer” (at p 1242).

As a pure matter of causation, it cannot possibly matter whose hands supplied the different bits of water, flame or fuel. What is driving the intuition of no causation is the judgment regarding attributable responsibility, which is especially brought to mind if the question is posed as ‘Did the teaspoon of water or match destroy the property?' rather than ‘Did the teaspoon of water or match contribute, even if only extremely minimally, to the flood or fire that destroyed the property?' What is generally agreed upon is that the trivial contributor should not be held liable when her contribution was trivial in comparison to the other contributing conditions and was neither strongly necessary nor independently strongly sufficient for the injury at issue, but this is a normative issue of attributable responsibility rather than causal contribution.”</span></span></p>

Whether an event which is one of very many that combine to cause loss should be regarded as a cause of the loss is not a question to which any general answer can be given. It must always depend on the context in which the question is asked. Where the context is a claim under an insurance policy, judgements of fault or responsibility are not relevant. All that matters is what risks the insurers have agreed to cover. We have already indicated that this is a question of contractual interpretation which must accordingly be answered by identifying (objectively) the intended effect of the policy as applied to the relevant factual situation.</a></p><a name="para190">

It seems incontrovertible that in the examples we have given there is a causal connection between the event and the loss.

We agree with Mr Kealey's submission on behalf of MS Amlin that the right question to ask is: did the insured peril cause the business interruption losses sustained by the policyholder within the meaning of the causal requirements specified in the policy? Taking MSA 1 as an example, the question is whether the interruption of the business carried on by the policyholder at the insured premises occurred “following” illness sustained by any person resulting from COVID-19 within a radius of 25 miles of the premises. In particular, it is necessary to ask: would the causal requirement imposed by the word “following” be satisfied by showing that one or more cases of illness from COVID-19 had occurred within the specified radius before national restrictions which caused interruption of the insured business were imposed on the basis of those and all other cases of COVID-19 that had occurred by that date?</a></p><a name="para192">

The parties to the insurance contracts may be presumed to have known that some infectious diseases - including, potentially, a new disease (like SARS) - can spread rapidly, widely and unpredictably. It is obvious that an outbreak of an infectious disease may not be confined to a specific locality or to a circular area delineated by a radius of 25 miles around a policyholder's premises. Hence no reasonable person would suppose that, if an outbreak of an infectious disease occurred which included cases within such a radius and was sufficiently serious to interrupt the policyholder's business, all the cases of disease would necessarily occur within the radius. It is highly likely that such an outbreak would comprise cases both inside and outside the radius and that measures taken by a public authority which affected the business would be taken in response to the outbreak as a whole and not just to those cases of disease which happened to fall within the circumference of the circle described by the radius provision.</a></p><a name="para194">

Not only would this potentially give rise to intractable counterfactual questions but, more fundamentally, it seems to us contrary to the commercial intent of the clause to treat uninsured cases of a notifiable disease occurring <u>outside</u> the territorial scope of the cover as depriving the policyholder of an indemnity in respect of interruption also caused by cases of disease which the policy is expressed to cover. We agree with the FCA's central argument in relation to the radius provisions that the parties could not reasonably be supposed to have intended that cases of disease outside the radius could be set up as a countervailing cause which displaces the causal impact of the disease inside the radius.</a></p><a name="para195">

This is the fact that the relevant wordings do not confine cover to a situation where the interruption of the business has resulted <u>only</u> from cases of a notifiable disease within the </a><a name="_Hlk58096547">radius</a>, as opposed to other cases elsewhere. As leading counsel for the FCA, Mr Edelman, pointed out, to apply a “but for” test in a situation where cases of disease inside and outside the radius are concurrent causes of business interruption loss would give the insurer similar protection to that which it would have had if loss caused by any occurrence of a notifiable disease outside the specified radius had been expressly excluded from cover. If the insurers had wished to impose such an exclusion, it was incumbent on them to include it in the terms of the policy.</p>

Rather than view each case individually, Mr Crane submits that the correct approach is to aggregate all the cases of disease which fall within the scope of the policy and to ask whether those cases, taken together, had an equal or similar causal impact when compared with the aggregate impact of all the cases of disease not covered by the policy. Wherever in the country a policyholder's business is located, the answer to that question will almost certainly be no. That is because, by the time of the actions taken by the UK Government in March 2020, COVID-19 had spread across most of the country; and, wherever on a map of the UK a circle with a 25 mile radius was drawn, the number of cases which had occurred within that radius would have been relatively small compared with the total number of cases elsewhere. On this analysis, </a><a name="_Hlk58318580">therefore, the overwhelmingly dominant cause of business interruption loss was occurrences of disease not covered by the insurance. </a>Hence it cannot be said that the loss was proximately caused - or on a realistic view caused at all - by an insured peril.</p>

We have concluded earlier that the word “occurrence”, as it is used in the disease clauses, bears its ordinary meaning of something which happens at a particular time, at a particular place and in a particular way; that each individual case of disease is properly regarded as a separate insured occurrence; and that those policies which do not use that term should nevertheless be interpreted similarly. The starting point for the analysis of causation is therefore that the occurrence of each case of illness sustained as a result of COVID-19 is a separate peril and thus potentially a separate cause of loss.</a></p><a name="para199"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para199"></a><a name="para200">200.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This does not mean that cases of disease cannot combine to cause loss that would not have resulted from any individual case of disease had it occurred alone. That is what would normally be expected to happen and precisely what has happened in the present case, albeit on a far greater scale than might have been anticipated. We would accept that the language of the policies is not inconsistent with an interpretation whereby, when cases of disease combine to cause loss, an insured occurrence of disease is not to be regarded as a proximate cause unless the other insured cases of disease with which it has combined, taken together, are of similar causal potency as any uninsured cases of disease (also viewed together). We do not consider, however, that this interpretation is one that makes commercial sense of the disease clauses.</a></p><a name="para200">

However, that is not a realistic possibility. Where interruption of a business is caused by an outbreak of an infectious disease, the situation is not one of discrete concurrent causes each of which, acting on its own, would have caused part of the loss but not the whole of it. Although we do not think that it was strictly accurate for the court below to describe all the cases of COVID-19 in the country as indivisible, what plainly is indivisible is the effect of such cases, via the measures taken by the UK Government, on any insured business. As the loss is indivisible, the question whether it was caused by an insured peril is an all or nothing one.</a></p><a name="para201"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para201"></a><a name="para202">202.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To attempt to answer that question by weighing the relative potency of insured and uninsured cases of disease would in many situations be unworkable. Suppose, for example, that some local restrictions were imposed in response to an outbreak of disease occurring partly inside and partly outside the specified radius of the premises and the restrictions had a damaging effect on the insured business. It is difficult to see how the weighing approach could provide a rational basis for determining whether the cases within the radius should be regarded as causes of the business interruption within the meaning of the policy. In the first place, it would potentially involve a complex and costly factual inquiry to try to find out exactly where all the cases of disease had occurred and how many occurred within and without the radius. Assuming that this information could be obtained, the next question would be what number or proportion of the cases is required to fall inside the radius in order for those cases to be regarded as causes of the business interruption for the purpose of the policy. Is it necessary, for example, to show that at least half of the cases to which the authorities were responding occurred inside the radius? Presumably not, since causes, in order to be regarded as proximate, do not have to be of precisely equal efficacy. So what lesser proportion would suffice? Is the threshold 40%, or 30%, or some other proportion, of the total number of cases? Or would even a small proportion count if the number of cases involved was in absolute terms sufficiently large? The policies provide no basis for answering these questions or for preferring any particular criterion to another.</a></p><a name="para202">

Staying with the example of an outbreak of disease occurring partly inside and partly outside the specified radius which results in the imposition of restrictions over an area which includes the insured premises, suppose that the majority of cases (or whatever is the number or proportion which means there is no cover) have occurred outside the radius. Suppose also that the same restrictions would still have been imposed if the cases outside the radius had been somewhat fewer such that the majority of cases were inside the radius. On the weighing approach the slightly different incidence of cases outside the radius would nevertheless have the result that the insurers were not liable to pay. The policies could not rationally have been intended to operate in such a whimsical way.</p>

A speed limit of 30 mph is in one sense arbitrary in that someone driving at a speed of 31 mph commits an offence, whereas someone driving at a speed of 29 mph does not, even though there may be no difference between them in terms of the danger actually posed to road users. Nevertheless, the benefits of having a clear rule which is relatively straightforward to apply far outweigh any objection based on its arbitrary effects. In a similar way, it is entirely reasonable for insurers to set a territorial limit to the scope of business interruption cover which is arbitrary in the sense that there is no particular logic for selecting a radius of 25 miles, rather than 24 or 26, to define it and though the consequence of selecting a specific distance will inevitably be that there will be no cover for business interruption in some cases when on very slightly different facts there would have been cover.</a></p><a name="para204">

As we have noted, on the weighing approach the policy provides no identifiable criterion, let alone a hard-edged one, for deciding what number or proportion of disease cases must fall inside the specified radius in comparison with the number or proportion occurring outside it in order to trigger cover. Secondly, making the availability of cover depend on the number or relative number of cases of disease occurring outside the territorial limit of the policy as well as on the number within it seems to us to introduce a different and further form of arbitrariness into the operation of the policy that - unlike the application of a clear rule - lacks a rational basis.</a></p><a name="para205">

This accords with the presumed intention of the parties to an insurance product sold principally to SMEs and often with relatively low financial limits. (For example, under MSA 1 the maximum payable for any one loss is £100,000.) It also accords with the desire for certainty manifest in the definition of cover by reference to a specific radius of 25 miles (or one mile) of the insured premises.</a></p><a name="para206">

They submit that, if the interpretation were correct, it would mean that a policyholder located on the Scilly Isles would be entitled to an indemnity if it could be shown that a trawler sailed within 25 miles of the insured premises with a single person on board who had contracted COVID-19 (and even if the disease had not yet been diagnosed).

The basis for this conclusion is the analysis of the court below, which in our opinion is correct, that each of the individual cases of illness resulting from COVID-19 which had occurred by the date of any Government action was a separate and equally effective cause of that action (and of the response of the public to it). Our conclusion does not depend on the particular terminology used in the clause to describe the required causal connection between the loss and the insured peril and applies equally whether the term used is “following” or some other formula such as “arising from” or “as a result of”</a>. It is a conclusion about the legal effect of the insurance contracts as they apply to the facts of this case.</p>

For example, the relevant clause in RSA 1 covers “loss as a result of … closure or restrictions placed on the Premises as a result of a notifiable human disease manifesting itself at the Premises or within a radius of 25 miles of the Premises”. In order to show that business interruption loss is covered by this clause, it will be sufficient to prove that the interruption was a result of closure or restrictions placed on the premises in response to cases of COVID-19 which included at least one case manifesting itself within a radius of 25 miles of the premises.</a></p><a name="para213">

Furthermore, the structure of these clauses is that the elements of the clause are required to operate in a causal sequence. A good example is the public authority clause in Hiscox 1-3 (set out more fully at para 111 above), which covers financial losses “<u>resulting solely and directly from</u> an interruption to your activities <u>caused by</u> … your inability to use the insured premises<b> </b><u>due to</u> restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance <u>following</u> … an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority” (our emphasis).</a></p><a name="para214">

That is because, although the FCA has suggested otherwise, we think it clear that the interruption is not part of the description of the insured peril. The concept of business interruption in insurance of this kind was in our view correctly analysed by Mr Simon Salzedo QC in his submissions on behalf of Argenta. It is a description of the type of loss or damage covered by the policy, in the same way as the type of loss or damage covered by, for example, a buildings insurance policy is physical destruction or damage. Thus, in a buildings insurance policy, unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer is liable for the contractual measure of (i) destruction of or physical damage to the insured buildings, which is (ii) proximately caused by (iii) a peril insured against under the policy (such as fire, storm etc). In business interruption insurance an interruption to the policyholder's business or activities is the counterpart of the first of these elements. It describes the nature of the harm to the policyholder's interest in the subject matter of the insurance for which an indemnity is given if it is proximately caused by an insured peril.</a></p><a name="para215">

Nevertheless, the peril covered by the clause is itself a composite one comprising elements that are required to occur in a causal sequence in order to give rise to a right of indemnity. 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">Setting out the elements of the insured peril in their correct causal sequence, they are: (A) an occurrence of a notifiable disease, which causes (B) </span></span></a><a name="_Hlk59023233">restrictions imposed by a public authority</a>, which cause (C) an inability to use the insured premises,<b> </b>

This must then be compared with the actual financial position of the business to establish the extent of the indemnity. The court considered that where, as in the case of the Hiscox clause, the peril is a composite one requiring a series of elements to be established, this “but for” test should be applied by asking what the position of the insured business would have been if none of the elements had occurred. The court explained this approach “as a matter of application of the insuring clause” in the following passage (at para 278 of the judgment):</a></p><a name="para218"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para218">“… we consider that the exercise must give effect to the insurance effected.

The insured peril is a composite one, involving three interconnected elements: (i) inability to use the insured premises (ii) due to restrictions imposed by a public authority (iii) ‘following' one of (a) to (e), relevantly (b) an occurrence of an infectious or contagious disease. What the insured is covering itself against is, we consider, the fortuity of being in a situation in which all those elements are present. In answering the counterfactual question as to what </a><a name="_Hlk58580386">would have been the position of the insured's business but for the occurrence of the insured peril</a>, it is accordingly necessary to strip out all three interconnected elements, including in this instance the national outbreak of COVID-19.”</p>

<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">outbreak of COVID-19. This, however, is manifestly not what Hiscox has agreed to cover. More generally, the court's approach would have the result that, however many the elements of the causal combination in a composite peril and however narrow in consequence the insured peril, once all elements are acting in combination such that the insured peril has occurred, the insurer becomes liable for all the consequences of the first element of the causal chain. Using the Hiscox symbols, on the court's approach, once the </span></span>A→B→C→D
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext"> causal chain is established, all the consequences of A are recoverable under the insurance. Logically, Hiscox submits, the position should be the reverse: the narrower the insured peril, the narrower the consequences for which </span></span>the policyholder is entitled to an indemnity

It seems to us that, having correctly identified the fortuity covered by the insurance as a situation in which all three interconnected elements are present, the court erred by adopting a test which does not reflect that fortuity. The effect of “stripping out” all three elements in considering what the position of the business would have been but for the occurrence of the insured peril is to ask what its position would have been if <u>none</u> of those elements had occurred - including, as the court said, the national outbreak of COVID-19. That, however, is to treat the insured peril as being, not the risk of all three elements occurring (in causal sequence), but the risk of <u>any one or more</u> of the elements occurring. That would include a situation where there was an outbreak of a notifiable disease which caused interruption and loss to the business but which did not lead to any restriction being imposed that resulted in inability to use the premises. That is not the indemnity which the insurer agreed to give.</a></p><a name="para220">

Counsel for Hiscox assert that the “core” or “essence” of the peril insured against by the public authority clause in the Hiscox policies is “restrictions imposed by a public authority”. From this, they invite the inference that the relevant counterfactual question to ask is what would the financial position of the business have been if the public authority had not imposed the restriction(s) which resulted in inability to use the insured premises. This should then be compared with the actual financial position of the business to determine the scope of the indemnity.</a></p><a name="para221">

In oral argument leading counsel for Hiscox, Mr Jonathan Gaisman QC, took as an example a nail salon which was forced to close by regulation 4 of the 26 March Regulations, as nail salons were one of the businesses listed in Part 2 of Schedule 2. He submitted that the relevant counterfactual is one in which nail salons were allowed to stay open but everything else which happened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic happened as it actually did. The indemnity is therefore limited to such additional loss of business as was suffered as a result of nail salons being forced to close compared with the loss that would have been suffered anyway in a world in which nail salons had been permitted to stay open but all other restrictions such as the other closures and restrictions imposed by regulations 4 and 5 and the prohibition in regulation 6 against leaving home without reasonable excuse, along with all other consequences of the pandemic, were the same as in the real world.</a></p><a name="para222"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para222"></a><a name="para223">223.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no logical reason, however, why in this example the “restriction imposed” should be characterised as the inclusion of nail salons in Part 2 of Schedule 2, rather than, say, the whole of regulation 4 or the whole of the 26 March Regulations or, more narrowly, regulation 4 in so far as it resulted in inability to use the insured premises. Indeed, the logic of Hiscox's approach indicates that the last of these scenarios is the correct counterfactual. That is because - as Hiscox submits, in our view correctly - the protection which it agreed to provide is against <u>all</u> 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">the elements specified in the clause acting in causal combination to cause </span></span></a><a name="_Hlk58590861">interruption of the business</a>. One of those elements is inability to use the insured premises
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">. Each additional element in the causal chain narrows the consequences for which </span></span>the policyholder is entitled to an indemnity
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">.</span></span> Thus, the final link narrows 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">the consequences covered by the policy from all </span></span>the consequences of the “restriction imposed” to only those consequences which result from the policyholder's inability to use the insured premises. If, therefore, the correct approach is - as Hiscox submits - to determine what the position of the business would have been but for the occurrence of (all the elements of) the insured peril, the appropriate assumption to make is that everything would have happened as it did except for the last link in the causal chain. In other words, the actual position of the business should be compared with what its position would have been if there had been a national outbreak of COVID-19 which led to the imposition of all the restrictions which were in fact imposed by the Government, including the restriction which required nail salons to close, but this restriction did not apply (uniquely) to the policyholder's business.</p>

This is then relied on as a justification for ignoring the final element in the causal chain (inability to use the insured premises) in framing the relevant counterfactual question. However, we can see no warrant for such an approach. The last element in the causal chain is just as much part of the insured peril as the other elements. Using the Hiscox symbols, leaving it out of account in framing the counterfactual question involves treating the insured peril as if it were not A→B→C→D, but A→B→C. That, as counsel for Hiscox said of the court's approach, involves an impermissible recasting of the parties' bargain.</a></p><a name="para225">

<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">the insured premises to close</span></span>, it can readily be seen that this approach is just as open to criticism as that of the court below. That is because it treats 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">the insured peril</span></span> as the risk that, if there was an outbreak of a notifiable disease sufficiently serious to lead

However, whilst the wording does include the words “solely and </span></span>directly

The effect of closing the restaurant would be to reduce the turnover of the business to nil. We do not consider that it would be consistent with the intended scope of the cover for the insurer to reject a claim for the resulting loss on the basis that the turnover would have been reduced anyway because of other consequences of national measures taken in response to COVID-19, such as the prohibition on leaving home without reasonable excuse. Such matters might have been sufficient to cause 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">business interruption loss in the absence of the insured peril. </span></span>To that extent, the losses covered by the public authority clause include losses which would have occurred even without the public authority restrictions.

Mr Gaisman described it as a “thirteenth chime” - by which we understood him to mean an assertion which “like the thirteenth stroke of a crazy clock … not only is itself discredited but casts a shade of doubt over all previous assertions”: see Lord Light LCJ in the fictional case of <i>Rex v Haddock</i> in <i>AP Herbert, Uncommon Law</i> (1935), p 28. In our view, however, Hiscox has miscounted. The reason why such losses would have occurred in any event is 
<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">that there are two (or more) causes each of which would by itself have inevitably brought about the loss without the other(s). The case is therefore one where the loss is “over-determined”. It is analogous to the example discussed earlier of two fires which combine to burn down a house although each would have done so even without the other. The fact that (because of the other fire) neither fire satisfies the “but for” test does not mean that in identifying each fire as a cause of the loss anything has gone wrong with </span></span>the clock mechanism.</p>

Continuing with the restaurant example, counsel for the FCA postulated a case where the restaurant had a star chef who was due to leave on 1 April 2020 for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. In this case it would be unreasonable to require the insurer to indemnify the policyholder for loss of turnover resulting from inability to use the premises in so far as such turnover would have been reduced in any event by reason of the chef's departure.</a></p><a name="para231">

<span class="Bodytext2"><span style="color:windowtext">caused by </span></span>an occurrence of a notifiable disease - the concurrent consequences of the different elements are “inextricably linked” and to attempt to separate them would be “artificial and unrealistic”. This point is made in a number of places in the judgment. For example, in discussing the prevention of access clause in the Arch wording (which we consider below), the court said (at para 348 of the judgment):</a></p><a name="para234"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the approach advocated by the insurers of stripping out the government restrictions etc and their immediate effect … whilst leaving the pandemic and its economic and social effects is entirely artificial and ignores the inextricable connection between the various elements of the insured peril, both as a matter of legal analysis and as a matter of practical reality, given the nature of the pandemic emergency.”</p>

One point made is that different effects of the pandemic and Government restrictions may be extremely difficult or impossible to disentangle. The court did not consider it a reasonable interpretation of the policies that the policyholder can only recover such loss as would have occurred in the absence, for example, of Government restrictions when the very effect of the restrictions will almost inevitably be to make it impossible to say with certainty what the position would have been in that event (see para 280 of the judgment).</a></p><a name="para235">

We agree with counsel for Hiscox that it is in the nature of business interruption claims that they can give rise to difficult questions of quantification, often concerning what would have happened in hypothetical circumstances. That might be so, for instance, in the case of the restaurant with a famous chef who was due to leave on 1 April. It might be very difficult and uncertain to estimate what the effect on turnover of the chef leaving would have been if the restaurant had not been required to close on 21 March. Yet such difficulty of proof is not a sufficient reason to ignore the effects of the chef's departure.</a></p><a name="para236">

It is inherent in a situation where the elements of the peril insured under the public authority clause occur in the required combination to cause business interruption that </a><a name="_Hlk59096129">there has been an occurrence of a notifiable disease which has led to the imposition of restrictions by a public authority. It is entirely predictable and to be expected that, even if they had not led to the closure of the insured premises, those elements of the insured peril would have had other potentially adverse effects on the turnover of the business. We have already expressed our view that it would undermine the commercial purpose of the cover to treat such potential effects as diminishing the scope of the indemnity. The underlying reason, as it seems to us, is that, although not themselves covered by the insurance, such effects are matters arising from the same original fortuity which the parties to the insurance would naturally expect to occur concurrently with the insured peril. They are not in that sense a separate and distinct risk.</a></p>

The court said that, to interpret the indemnity as limited to loss that would not have been suffered but for the forced closure of the premises “would render the cover largely illusory, as insurers would argue that, as no one is likely to want to eat at a restaurant infested by vermin, all or most of the business interruption loss would have been suffered in any event.” The court considered that such cover “cannot have been intended and is not what we consider would reasonably be understood to be what the parties had agreed to”.</a></p><a name="para238">

It applies equally to an originating cause of loss covered by the policy which is not expressly mentioned. In the case of the Hiscox 4 wording, for example, the first element in the specified causal chain is an occurrence of a notifiable human disease within one mile of the insured premises. Where there is such an occurrence, the disease is very likely also to have occurred elsewhere. In the present case the originating cause of any local occurrence of disease is the global COVID-19 pandemic. In circumstances where the policy does not exclude loss arising from such an event, other concurrent effects of the pandemic on an insured business do not reduce the indemnity under the public authority clause.</a></p><a name="para240">

That case concerned a cruise operator's claim for business interruption losses from a downturn in bookings arising from US State Department warnings issued following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The insured peril was the State Department warnings regarding terrorist activities rather than the terrorist activities themselves. It was common ground that the 9/11 attacks and the warnings were concurrent causes of the downturn in bookings. An argument that the causative effects of the terrorist attacks and the State Department warnings could be separated out was rejected by Tomlinson J on the grounds that “[i]t is simply impossible to divorce anxiety derived from the attacks themselves from anxiety derived from the stark warnings issued in the immediate aftermath” (para 68).

For completeness, we would point out that this interpretation depends on a finding of concurrent causation involving causes of approximately equal efficacy. If it was found that, although all the elements of the insured peril were present, it could not be regarded as a proximate cause of loss and the sole proximate cause of the loss was the COVID-19 pandemic, then there would be no indemnity. An example might be a travel agency which lost almost all its business because of the travel restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic. Although customer access to its premises might have become impossible, if it was found that the sole proximate cause of the loss of its walk-in customer business was the travel restrictions and not the inability of customers to enter the agency, then the loss would not be covered.</a></p><a name="para244">

It is only loss occasioned by prevention of access to the premises that is covered by the clause. He then, however, goes on to submit that in assessing that loss the correct comparison, to reflect the agreement to indemnify, is between the actual turnover of the business and what the turnover would have been on the assumption that the premises had been required to close but everything else had remained the same, including the COVID-19 pandemic (which Arch accepts is an “emergency which is likely to endanger life”).</a></p><a name="para246">

It incorrectly treats the indemnity as confined to loss which would not have occurred but for the operation of the insured peril. In the restaurant example discussed earlier, it may very well be true that, if the premises had not been forced to close, turnover would have been reduced in any event as a result of other effects of the emergency, including Government actions and advice. But it is also true that, if there had been no other effects of the emergency, or of Government actions and advice, this turnover would still have been lost as a result of the premises being forced to close. To this extent, there were concurrent causes of loss, each sufficient to cause loss without the other. Furthermore, these concurrent causes arose out of the same underlying or originating cause, namely the COVID-19 pandemic. As with the Hiscox policies, on the correct interpretation of the Arch wording, such loss is in our view covered by the policy.</a></p><a name="para247">

For the reasons already given in discussing the arguments made on behalf of Hiscox, we do not consider this to be the correct approach.

In most wordings this is the calendar year preceding the operation of the insured peril. A “standard turnover” or “standard revenue” is derived from the turnover of the business in this period. This figure is then compared with the actual turnover or revenue during the indemnity period. The results of the business in the comparator period are also used to derive a percentage of turnover that represents gross profit. The rate of gross profit is then applied to the reduction in turnover to calculate the recoverable loss. Increase in the cost of working during the indemnity period is also typically covered.</a></p><a name="para253">

For example, the general trend in the business may be such as to make it likely that there would have been increased or decreased turnover during the indemnity period in any case compared with the previous year. Equally, there may be specific reasons why the turnover during the prior year was depressed, such as a strike that affected the business, or why it would be expected to have been depressed anyway during the indemnity period, such as a scheduled strike. The purpose of the trends clause is to provide for adjustments to be made to reflect “trends” or “circumstances” such as these. The aim is to achieve a more accurate figure for the insured loss than would be achieved merely by a comparison with the prior period and to seek to arrive at a figure which, consistently with the indemnity principle, is as representative of the true loss as is possible. The adjustment may work in favour of either the policyholder or the insurer, but it is meant to be in the interests of both.</a></p><a name="para254">

In the case of the disease clauses, the insured peril was identified as the notifiable disease or all individual cases of the disease. That meant that the relevant counterfactual for the purpose of making adjustments under the trends clause was what results would have been achieved by the business during the indemnity period but for COVID-19. In relation to the prevention of access and hybrid clauses, the court held that the correct approach is to seek to ascertain what the results of the business would have been if none of the elements of the insured peril had occurred. So, for example, in relation to the Arch wording set out above, this would require the assumption to be made that there had been (i) no emergency likely to endanger life; (ii) no consequent Government action or advice; and (iii) no consequent prevention of access to the premises. Since the emergency was the COVID-19 pandemic, this meant assuming that it had not occurred.

Similarly, the depletion of turnover after the fire may have been aggravated or partially hidden by <u>factors quite independent of the fire</u>. Any untoward event, such as a breakdown of machinery, a flooding of works, or a strike of employees, whether it occurs before or after the fire, may have the effect of upsetting our calculations.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is important to bear in mind that the indemnity in respect of reduction in turnover is qualified by the words ‘in consequence of the damage.'

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><i>Riley</i> then gave an example of a reduction in turnover caused both by insured damage and by an “<u>extraneous</u> circumstance such as a strike” (our emphasis) and explained that an appropriate adjustment must be made to the figures for standard turnover to reflect the effect of the strike.</p>

The example is a case where both a hotel and a necessary access bridge (not owned by the hotel) are damaged by a storm. Had there been no damage to the hotel, it would have had no business anyway because of the damage to the access bridge until the bridge had been repaired. The author expresses the opinion that the business interruption loss would nevertheless be assessed on the basis of turnover that would have applied if the access bridge had not been damaged for such time as the damage to the hotel on its own would have affected the trading of the business: see para 35 at p 28 and Case Study IV at p 50.</a></p><a name="para275">

The flooding was such that all the shops on Main Street were flooded to a depth of many feet and, after the water subsided, the street effectively became a building site for the next six months. If the trends clause had been treated as requiring an adjustment to be made to reflect what the turnover of each individual shop would have been but for the damage to that particular shop, the insurance recovery would have been substantially reduced on the basis that the business would have suffered a severe downturn in any event by reason of the wide area damage that affected other businesses. That was not, however, the approach taken by the market. Instead, claims were met up to the level that would have applied had the damage been restricted solely to the insured premises.</a></p><a name="para276">

In US policy wordings it appears that the counterfactual is generally expressed in terms of what would have happened “had no loss occurred”. Where the underlying cause of the loss is a hurricane, it has been held that this requires the assumption to be made that the hurricane would not have occurred. Thus, in <i>Catlin Syndicate Ltd v Imperial Palace of Mississippi Inc</i>,<i> </i>600 F 3d 511 (2010) the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had to decide how to determine loss under the business interruption provision of an insurance policy issued to the Imperial Palace casino in Mississippi. The casino was damaged by Hurricane Katrina which also caused damage to the surrounding area. When the casino re-opened, its revenue was much greater than before the hurricane as many nearby casinos remained closed and people who wanted to gamble had few choices. The casino argued that, in quantifying its business interruption loss, the requirement to consider what would have happened “had no loss occurred” meant assuming that no damage to the casino had occurred, but not that the hurricane had not occurred. This argument was rejected by the court (at pp 515-516) in the following terms:</a></p><a name="para278"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Imperial Palace asserts that Catlin asks us to interpret the business interruption provision in such a way that the phrase ‘had no loss occurred' morphs into ‘had no occurrence occurred'. Imperial Palace argues that instead, we should disentangle the loss from the occurrence and determine loss based on a hypothetical in which Hurricane Katrina hit Mississippi, damaged all of Imperial Palace's competitors, but left Imperial Palace intact: the occurrence occurred, but the loss did not. While we agree with Imperial Palace that the loss is distinct from the occurrence - at least in theory - we also believe that the two are inextricably intertwined under the language of the business-interruption provision. Without language in the policy instructing us to do so, we decline to interpret the business-interruption provision in such a way that the loss caused by Hurricane Katrina can be distinguished from the occurrence of Hurricane Katrina itself.”</p>

In both the <i>Catlin</i> case and the <i>Prudential</i> case the argument of the insured was that the loss should be adjusted by comparing the actual results of the business with what they would have been if there had been no damage to the casino/motel, but the hurricane had nevertheless occurred causing all the other damage that was in fact caused to the surrounding area. Adopting this basis of adjustment would have put the casino/motel in a position to claim increased “windfall” profits as a result of being the only undamaged casino/motel in the area.</a></p><a name="para280">

It involves assuming that, even if there had been no prevention of access, turnover during the indemnity period would have been reduced as a result of other effects of the emergency. The fact that those effects were being felt before cover was triggered makes no difference in this regard. Nor is it correct that, as counsel for Arch submit, leaving such effects out of account in calculating the indemnity amounts to compensating the policyholder for uninsured loss which began before the insured peril operated. On the contrary, to reduce the indemnity to reflect a downturn caused by other effects of the pandemic, whenever they began, would be to refuse to indemnify the policyholder for loss proximately caused by the insured peril on the basis that the loss was also proximately caused by uninsured (but non-excluded) perils with the same originating cause.

The insurance policy, which was governed by English law, provided cover against physical damage to the property on an all risks basis. It also provided cover for loss due to interruption or interference with the business “directly arising from Damage”. The trends clause was in similar terms to those in the present case and provided that the adjusted figures “shall represent as nearly as may be reasonably practicable the results which but for the Damage would have been obtained during the relative period after the Damage”. The term “Damage” was defined in the policy to mean “direct physical loss destruction or damage” to the hotel.</p>

Its business was severely affected both by the physical damage to the hotel and by the general impact of the hurricanes on the city. A dispute arose about the amounts which the insured (“OEH”) was entitled to recover which the parties agreed to submit to arbitration in London. A central issue was whether OEH could recover business interruption losses which resulted not only from the physical damage to the hotel but also from the wider damage to the city.</a></p><a name="para298">

The arbitrators accepted the insurer's case, observing that counsel for OEH “did not, in the view of the tribunal, ever supply a convincing answer to this submission”. The tribunal held that the language of the policy:</a></p><a name="para299">

This had not been argued before the arbitrators. The court recognised that there was “considerable force” in the argument (para 33), but pointed out that what “fairness and reasonableness” require “is very much a matter for the tribunal of fact, rather than for this court on an appeal limited to questions of law” (para 36). The court also observed that the issue was one on which no findings had been made by the arbitral tribunal since the argument was not put to it (para 37).

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the tribunal that the clause is concerned only with the damage, not with the causes of the damage. What is covered are business interruption losses caused by damage, not business interruption losses caused by damage or ‘other damage which resulted from the same cause'. Nowhere in the Trends clause does it state that ‘variations or special circumstances affecting the Business either before or after the Damage or which would have affected the Business had the Damage not occurred' has to be something completely unconnected with the damage in the sense that it had an independent cause to the cause of the damage. The assumption required to be made under the Trends clause is ‘had the Damage not occurred'; not ‘had the Damage and whatever event caused the Damage not occurred'.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Generali that OEH's construction effectively requires words to be read into the clause or for it to be re-drafted. Further, such a re-drafting of the Trends Clause, which would allow OEH to recover for the loss in gross operating profit suffered as a result of the occurrence of the insured event (ie the hurricanes) as opposed to the loss suffered as a result of the damage to the hotel, is inconsistent with the causation requirement of the main insuring clause which OEH accepts requires proof that the losses claimed were caused by damage to the hotel.”</p>

Applying the analysis set out earlier under the heading “Causation”, business interruption loss which arose because both (a) the hotel was damaged and also (b) the surrounding area and other parts of the city were damaged by the hurricanes had two concurrent causes, each of which was by itself sufficient to cause the relevant business interruption but neither of which satisfied the “but for” test because of the existence of the other. In such a case when both the insured peril and the uninsured peril which operates concurrently with it arise from the same underlying fortuity (the hurricanes), then provided that damage proximately caused by the uninsured peril (ie in the <i>Orient-Express</i> case, damage to the rest of the city) is not excluded, loss resulting from both causes operating concurrently is covered. In the <i>Orient-Express</i> case the tribunal and the court were therefore wrong to hold that the business interruption loss was not covered by the insuring clause to the extent that it did not satisfy the “but for” test.</a></p><a name="para309">

In any event, for the reasons set out above under the heading “The trends clauses”, we consider that the correct approach in the <i>Orient-Express</i> case would have been to construe the trends clause so as to exclude from the assessment of what would have happened if the damage had not occurred circumstances which had the same underlying or originating cause as the damage, namely the hurricanes.</a></p><a name="para310">

The practical effect of their analysis is that all of the insuring clauses which are in issue on the appeal to this court (not including those clauses where the issues appealed by the FCA are academic) will provide cover for business interruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the trends clauses will not cut it down in the calculation of the amounts payable.</a></p><a name="para314">

This was not, of course, a disease which anyone could have had specifically in mind when the policies in issue were written and marketed. But it is clear from the use of the definition of a “Notifiable Disease” in most of the relevant clauses, and equivalent wording in the remainder, that COVID-19 (when it appeared) fell squarely within the types of disease for which all the relevant disease and hybrid clauses provided cover: see in particular paras 51 to 53 of the majority judgment. Thus it cannot be said that cover for business interruption attributable to the reaction to a disease like COVID-19 lay outside the purview of the policies in issue.</a></p><a name="para315">

That outcome seemed to me to be clearly contrary to the spirit and intent of the relevant provisions of the policies in issue. It therefore comes as no surprise to me that all the judges who have considered these issues have been unanimous in rejecting that outcome, albeit that this court has done so, rightly in my view, more comprehensively than did the court below. This is not to mis-use the dubious benefit of hindsight when applying an insuring clause to events which could not have been contemplated by the parties at the time of their bargain. As the majority show, there were a number of well-known notifiable diseases (such as cholera, plague, typhus, yellow fever and SARS) to which the relevant clauses clearly applied, all of which were capable of spreading rapidly and widely, so as potentially to cause a threat to health on a national scale, and to threaten a national reaction by the responsible authorities, leading to business disruption on a national scale.</a></p><a name="para316">

By that I mean the provisions which delimit cover for the effects of a notifiable disease (in this case COVID-19) by reference to its incidence within a circle defined by a 25 mile or 1 mile radius from the insured premises (“the radius”). The insurers' case was that (i) the radius limitations meant that only occurrences of COVID-19 within the radius were within the insured peril and (ii) that the application of a “but for” causation test to identify the loss for which compensation was payable would be bound to produce a nil return, because the national response to the pandemic would have been exactly the same even if there had been no outbreak within the radius.</a></p><a name="para317"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para317"></a><a name="para318">318.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preferred response of the judges in the court below was to treat the radius limitation not as defining the insured peril, which they identified as the COVID-19 pandemic (at least within the whole of the UK), but as a condition for cover which required the disease first to have spread within the radius. In the rare cases where there was no such spread (probably confined to insured premises in the Isles of Scilly and possibly parts of the Western Isles of Scotland), there would be no cover at all even if those premises suffered serious business interruption because of national restrictions on movement. In relation to the overwhelming majority of premises the radius limitation would merely define the date from which business interruption could constitute the basis for a claim. But the court below adopted as a fall-back analysis the identification of every case of COVID-19 as a separate insured peril, each just as causative of the national reaction, and leading thereby to consequential business interruption, as any other.</a></p><a name="para318"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para318"></a><a name="para319">319.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court the majority have rejected the primary analysis of the court below, but in substance accepted and applied the alternative. They have, in effect, rescued the policyholders from the at first sight sombre consequences of a narrow definition of the insured peril by a principled application of the doctrine of concurrent cause, where (in settled insurance law) the existence of one or more concurrent causes of loss, other than the insured peril itself, does not prevent cover provided that the concurrent causes are not themselves expressly excluded. Encouraged by the court below they have done so, rightly in my view, by overruling the only reported case on comparable facts, namely the <i>Orient-Express</i> case. What is striking about the present case is that each and every separate case of COVID-19 is identified as an equally operative concurrent cause of the national response to the pandemic, so that the typical number of concurrent causes in the authorities, say two or three, is increased by orders of magnitude to something approaching, or even exceeding, a million. But there is no reason why the essential logic of concurrent cause cannot be scaled up in that way.</a></p><a name="para319"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para319"></a><a name="para320">320.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not to say that the majority have insulated policyholders from the unfortunate consequences of a bad bargain (properly construed) by the healing balm of purely legal rules of causation. On the contrary, and again rightly in my view, the majority ground their treatment of concurrent causation firmly within the process of construction. The question whether particular consequential harm to a policyholder is subject to indemnity is as much a part of the process of interpreting their bargain as is the identification of the insured peril. It is therefore a quite distinct process from, for example, applying the law about causation and remoteness of loss for the purpose of identifying the harm liable to be made good by tortfeasors to their victims. In terms intelligible to non-lawyers, the question is: for what loss have the parties agreed that the insurers should compensate the policyholders as the result of the occurrence of the insured peril? Both the insured peril and the covered loss lie at the very heart of the contract of insurance, and the process of construction requires that they be addressed together.</a></p><a name="para320"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para320"></a><a name="para321">321.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Left to myself I would not have departed from the adoption of both these two alternatives by the court below save that, since they both lead to the same conclusion, it is not necessary to prefer one over the other. As already noted, the underlying driver for some workable analysis is the need to avoid a conclusion that, as the insurers contend, clauses with radius limitations are a completely illusory form of cover for a pandemic type of disease falling clearly within the covered class. I recognise the force of the linguistic analysis by the majority which leads them to reject, as outwith the insured peril, any occurrence of COVID-19 outside the specified radius. I accept that the use of “occurrence” and similar words may lend some weight to a conclusion that every individual case, rather than the outbreak of the disease as a whole, is a separate insured peril. I acknowledge that the recognition of a million concurrent causes of equal potency is consistent with established authority, although an extension of it into new territory.</a></p><a name="para321"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para321"></a><a name="para322">322.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My main reasons for thinking that the alternative construction, which treats COVID-19 as a whole as falling within the insured perils once it spreads within the specified radius, is as persuasive as that of the majority, are as follows. First, construction requires the court to put itself into the mind of the reasonably informed reader of the contract in issue, so as to understand what that hypothetical person (rather than an insurance lawyer) would think that the parties meant by the words which they have used, in the relevant context. To my mind, that person would ask: do clauses with the radius limitations provide cover for the adverse business consequences of a national reaction to a national pandemic disease? They would likely answer yes or no. But I am less confident that they would answer: No, there is cover only for the consequences of individual cases within the radius, but since they are each as causally potent as any other case or cases, cover is in practice provided for the national consequences of a national outbreak, because of the law about non-excluded concurrent cause. They might find it as easy to conclude that the parties meant that cover for the national disease was there, provided it reached, spread, encroached or extended (call it what you will) within the radius.</a></p><a name="para322"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para322"></a><a name="para323">323.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, I would not be confident that the hypothetical reader would necessarily attribute the case by case specificity to the word “occurrence” or its synonyms given to it by the majority. Depending upon context, the word “occurrence” can properly be applied to happenings which do not take place at a single specified time, in a particular way and at a particular location. Thus a hurricane, a storm or a flood may properly be described as an occurrence even though each may take place over a substantial period of time, and over an area which changes over time. It is not in my view an inappropriate word to use about a pandemic disease as a whole, although I accept that it may be a pointer of some weight to an individual case analysis.</a></p><a name="para323"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para323"></a><a name="para324">324.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the reasoning adopted by the majority might be regarded by the hypothetical reader as somewhat circuitous. Its end product is, as already noted, that cover is effectively provided for business interruption caused by a national reaction to a national pandemic, provided that it extends within the radius. If so, the reader might ask, why not interpret it as doing so directly? An illustration of the length of that journey may be provided by reading the majority judgment, but stopping at para 95. At that point in the analysis, the reader might think that the policyholders with radius-limited disease clauses had lost.</a></p><a name="para324"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para324"></a><a name="para325">325.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of this means that I consider that the analysis of the majority is not a readily available construction of clauses which contain a radius limitation. If it were the only means of giving those clauses real rather than illusory cover for diseases of a type which they clearly comprehend, then I would agree with the majority without qualification. It is often said that there can only ever be one “true” construction of any contractual provision. Where different constructions produce different results it may well be necessary to choose between them. But where, as here, the practical outcome is the same, there is to my mind no such necessity.</a></p><a name="para325">

It is that I would be cautious about treating the cases about defence costs (dealt with by the majority at paras 186 to 188) as of any general application outside their specific field. In my view, and notwithstanding that they can be viewed as consistent with a concurrent cause analysis, cases about insurance cover for costs are better regarded as <i>sui generis</i>.</a></p><a name="para326">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE it looks as though we're now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. And without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for 14 days. That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies. And even if you don't have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111. Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So third, in a few days' time - by this coming weekend - it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And it's now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others. And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it's important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well. And so we've also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Prime Minister's statement of 18 March 2020 included the following:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I want to repeat that everyone - everyone - must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also - more importantly - to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings - pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands. …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now - we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils - for the vast majority of pupils - until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">But of course, as I've always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too - from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. …”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">To stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms, for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms - a new continuous cough or a high temperature.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">To avoid pubs bars, clubs and restaurants.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">To work from home if at all possible.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">Keep washing your hands …</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Of course it is.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations, we are collectively telling, telling cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">We're also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things [sic] is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don't. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others. So that's why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that's how we can protect our NHS and save lives.”</p>

And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible;</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.</p>
