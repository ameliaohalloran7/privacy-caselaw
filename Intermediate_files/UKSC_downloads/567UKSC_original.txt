<p class="NewSpeech">LORD SUMPTION: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom
Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Briggs agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimant, Tiuta International, was a specialist lender of short-term
business finance, until it went into administration on 5 July 2012. These
proceedings were brought by Tiuta in support of a claim against the defendant
surveyors for negligently valuing a partially completed residential development
over which it proposed to take a charge to secure a loan. The present appeal
raises a question of principle concerning the quantum of damages. Since it
arises out of an application for summary judgment, it has to be determined on
facts some of which are admitted but others of which must be assumed for the
purposes of the appeal. They are as follows.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 4 April 2011, Tiuta entered into a loan facility agreement with Mr
Richard Wawman in the sum of £2,475,000 for a term of nine months from initial
drawdown, in connection with a development in Sunningdale by a company called
Drummond House Construction and Developments Ltd, with which Mr Wawman was
associated. Advances under the facility were to be secured by a legal charge
over the development. The facility agreement was made on the basis of a
valuation of the development by De Villiers. They had reported that the
development was worth £2,300,000 in its current state and that if completed in
accordance with all current consents and to a standard commensurate with its
location it would be worth about £4,500,000. The initial advance was drawn down
on 8 April 2011 as soon as the charge had been executed. Other advances under
the facility followed.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 19 December 2011, shortly before the facility was due to expire,
Tiuta entered into a second facility agreement with Mr Wawman in the sum of
£3,088,252 for a term of six months in connection with the same development. Of
this sum, £2,799,252 was for the refinancing of the indebtedness under the
first facility and £289,000 was new money advanced for the completion of the
development. A fresh charge was taken over the development to secure sums due
under the second facility agreement. On 19 January 2012, Tiuta advanced
£2,560,268.45, which was paid into Mr Wawman’s existing loan account, thereby
discharging the whole of the outstanding indebtedness under the first facility.
Between that date and 8 June 2012 further sums were drawn down under the second
facility amounting to £281,590 and presumably spent on the development. The
advances under the second facility were made on the basis of a further
valuation of the development by De Villiers. There were three iterations of the
further valuation. On 8 November 2011, De Villiers had valued the development
in its current state at £3,250,000 and upon completion at £4,900,000. The
current state valuation was subsequently revised on 22 December 2011 to £3,400,000
and on 23 December 2011 to £3,500,000. The second facility agreement expired on
19 July 2012, a few weeks after Tiuta went into administration. None of the
indebtedness outstanding under it has been repaid.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that there can be no liability in damages in respect
of the advances made under the first facility. This is because (i) there is no
allegation of negligence in the making of the valuation on which the first
facility agreement was based; and (ii) even if there had been, the advances
made under that facility were discharged out of the advances under the second
facility, leaving the lender with no recoverable loss. This last point is based
on the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <i>Preferred Mortgages Ltd v
Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agencies Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/336.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 336</a> and of this
court in <i>Swynson Ltd v Lowick Rose LLP (in liquidation)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/32.html">[2017] 2 WLR 1161</a>. It is not challenged on this appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present claim is concerned only with the liabilities arising out of
the valuation which De Villiers made for the purposes of the second facility.
It is alleged, and for present purposes must be assumed, that the valuations
given for the purposes of the second facility were negligent, and that but for
that negligence the advances under the second facility would not have been
made. In those circumstances, the valuers contend that the most that they can
be liable for by way of damages is the new money advanced under the second
facility. They cannot, they say, be liable for that part of the loss which
arises from the advance made under the second facility and applied in discharge
of the indebtedness under the first. If (as has to be assumed) Tiuta would not
have made the advances under the second facility but for the valuers’
negligence, the advances under the first facility would have remained
outstanding and would have remained unpaid. That part of their loss would
therefore have been suffered in any event, irrespective of the care, or lack of
it, which went into the valuations prepared for the purposes of the second
facility. On that ground, the valuers applied for a summary order dismissing
that part of the claim which arose out of the refinancing element of the
advances under the second facility.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion the result of the facts as I have set them out is
perfectly straightforward and turns on ordinary principles of the law of
damages. The basic measure of damages is that which is required to restore the
claimant as nearly as possible to the position that he would have been in if he
had not sustained the wrong. This principle is qualified by a number of others
which serve to limit the recoverable losses to those which bear a sufficiently
close causal relationship to the wrong, could not have been avoided by reasonable
steps in mitigation, were reasonably foreseeable by the wrongdoer and are
within the scope of the latter’s duty. In the present case, we are concerned
only with the basic measure. In a case of negligent valuation where but for the
negligence the lender would not have lent, this involves what Lord Nicholls in <i>Nykredit
Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (No 2)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/53.html">[1997] 1 WLR 1627</a>, 1631
called the “basic comparison”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is axiomatic that in assessing
loss caused by the defendant’s negligence the basic measure is the comparison
between (a) what the plaintiff’s position would have been if the defendant had
fulfilled his duty of care and (b) the plaintiff’s actual position. Frequently,
but not always, the plaintiff would not have entered into the relevant
transaction had the defendant fulfilled his duty of care and advised the
plaintiff, for instance, of the true value of the property. When this is so, a
professional negligence claim calls for a comparison between the plaintiff’s
position had he not entered into the transaction in question and his position
under the transaction. That is the basic comparison. Thus, typically in the
case of a negligent valuation of an intended loan security, the basic
comparison called for is between (a) the amount of money lent by the plaintiff,
which he would still have had in the absence of the loan transaction, plus
interest at a proper rate, and (b) the value of the rights acquired, namely the
borrower’s covenant and the true value of the overvalued property.”</p>

</span>If the valuers had not been negligent in reporting the value of the
property for the purpose of the second facility, the lenders would not have
entered into the second facility, but they would still have entered into the
first. On that hypothesis, therefore, the lenders would have been better off in
two respects. First, they would not have lost the new money lent under the
second facility, but would still have lost the original loans made under the
first. Secondly, the loans made under the first facility would not have been
discharged with the money advanced under the second facility, so that if&nbsp; the
valuation prepared for the first facility had been negligent, the irrecoverable
loans made under that facility would in principle have been recoverable as
damages. There being no allegation of negligence in relation to the first
facility, this last point does not arise. Accordingly, the lender’s loss is
limited to the new money advanced under the second facility.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>This is what Timothy Fancourt QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, held.
But the Court of Appeal disagreed. By a majority (Moore-Bick and King LJJ,
McCombe LJ dissenting), they allowed the appeal. The leading judgment was
delivered by Moore-Bick LJ. He criticised the deputy judge’s reasoning on the
ground that it failed to take into account the fact that the second facility
was structured as a refinancing so that the advance was used to pay off the
pre-existing debt, thereby releasing the valuers from “any potential liability
in respect of the first valuation.” From this, he concluded that the advance
under the second facility “stands apart from the first and the basic comparison
for ascertaining the appellant’s loss is between the amount of that second loan
and the value of the security.” He explained this as follows:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The appellant entered into the
second transaction in reliance on the respondent’s valuation. If the valuation
had not been negligent, the appellant would not have entered into the second
transaction, and would have suffered no loss on that transaction as a result.
It would have been left with the first loan and the security for it, together
with any claim it might have had against the valuer. However, that is of no
relevance to the respondent in its capacity as valuer for the purposes of the
second loan. The loss which the appellant sustained as a result of entering
into the second transaction was the advance of the second loan, less the
developer’s covenant and the true value of the security. If the value of the
property was negligently overstated, the respondent will be liable to the
extent that the appellant's loss was caused by its over-valuation.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Moore-Bick LJ went on to say that his conclusion would
have been the same even if a different valuer had prepared the original
valuation on which the first facility was based. This was because the valuer</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“valued the property itself in the
expectation that the appellant would advance funds up to its full reported
value in reliance on its valuation. There is nothing unfair in holding the
respondent liable in accordance with its own valuation for the purposes of the
second transaction.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I regret that I cannot agree. It does not follow from the fact that the
advance under the second facility was applied in discharge of the advances
under the first, that the court is obliged to ignore the fact that the lender
would have lost the advances under the first facility in any event. Lord Nicholls’
statement in <i>Nykredit</i> assumes, as he points out in the passage that I
have quoted, that but for the negligent valuation, he would still have had the
money which it induced him to lend. In the present case, Tiuta would not still
have had it, because it had already lent it under the first facility.
Moore-Bick LJ appears to have thought that this was irrelevant because the
effect was to release the valuer from any potential liability in respect of the
first facility. I would agree that if the valuers had incurred a liability in
respect of the first facility, the lenders’ loss in relation to the second
facility might at least arguably include the loss attributable to the
extinction of that liability which resulted from the refinancing of the
existing indebtedness. But the premise on which this matter comes before the
court is that there was no potential liability in respect of the first facility
because that was entered into on the basis of another valuation which is not
said to have been negligent.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moore-Bick LJ’s view appears to have been that none of this mattered
because the valuer would have contemplated that he might be liable for the full
amount of the advances under the second facility, so that it was a windfall for
him that part of the advances was used to repay a pre-existing debt rather than
to fund the development. A similar argument was advanced before us. The
difficulty about it is that while the reasonable contemplation of the valuer
might be relevant in determining what responsibility he assumed or what loss
might be regarded as foreseeable, it cannot be relevant to Lord Nicholls’
“basic comparison”. That involves asking by how much the lender would have been
better off if he had not lent the money which he was negligently induced to
lend. This is a purely factual inquiry. There are, as I have pointed out, legal
filters which may result in the valuer being liable for less than the
difference. For example, part of it may be too remote or is not within the
scope of the relevant duty. But the valuer cannot be liable for more than the
difference which his negligence has made, simply because he contemplated that
on hypothetical facts different from those which actually obtained, he might
have been. There are many cases in which the internal arrangements of a claimant
mean that his financial loss is smaller than it might have been. That may be
fortunate for the defendant, but it cannot make him liable for more than the
claimant’s actual financial loss.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>Ms Joanna Smith QC, who appeared for the lenders, was realistic enough
to perceive these difficulties, and adopted a rather different approach. She
submitted that the court should disregard the fact that the advance under the
second facility was applied in discharge of the outstanding indebtedness under
the first, because that application of the funds was a collateral benefit to
the lender, which they were not obliged to take into account in computing their
loss. The argument is that if the discharge of the outstanding indebtedness
under the first facility is disregarded, damages can be assessed as if the
whole of the loan under the second facility was an additional advance. Since
that additional advance would not have been made or lost but for the negligent
valuations of November and December 2011 the whole of it is recoverable as
damages.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not persuaded that this was what the Court of Appeal had in mind,
but her point is none the worse for that. The real objection to it is more
fundamental. This court has recently had to deal with collateral benefits in a
context not far removed from the present one. The general rule is that where
the claimant has received some benefit attributable to the events which caused his
loss, it must be taken into account in assessing damages, unless it is
collateral. In <i>Swynson Ltd v Lowick Rose LLP (in liquidation)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/32.html">[2017] 2 WLR 1161</a>, para 11, it was held that as a general rule “collateral benefits are
those whose receipt arose independently of the circumstances giving rise to the
loss.” Leaving aside purely benevolent benefits, the paradigm cases are
benefits under distinct agreements for which the claimant has given
consideration independent of the relevant legal relationship with the defendant,
for example insurance receipts or disability benefits under contributory pension
schemes. These are not necessarily the only circumstances in which a benefit
arising from a breach of duty will be treated as collateral, for there may be
analogous cases which do not exactly fit into the traditional categories. But
they are a valuable guide to the kind of benefits that may properly be left out
of account on this basis.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The discharge of the existing indebtedness out of the advance made under
the second facility was plainly not a collateral benefit in this sense. In the
first place, it did not confer a benefit on the lenders and so no question
arises of either taking it into account or leaving it out of account. Lord
Nicholls’ “basic comparison” requires one to look at the whole of the
transaction which was caused by the negligent valuation. In this case, that
means that one must have regard to the fact that the refinancing element of the
second facility both (i) increased the lender’s exposure and ultimate loss
under the second facility by £2,560,268.45, and (ii) reduced its loss under the
first facility by the same amount. Its net effect on the lender’s exposure and
ultimate loss was therefore neutral. Only the new money advanced under the
second facility made a difference. It is true that the refinancing element
might not have been neutral if the discharge of the indebtedness under the
first facility had also extinguished a liability of the valuers under the first
facility. But on the assumptions that we must make on this appeal there was no
such liability. Secondly, even on the footing that there was such a liability,
the benefit arising from the discharge of the indebtedness under the first
facility was not collateral because it was required by the terms of the second
facility. The lenders did not intend to advance the whole of the second
facility in addition to the whole of the first, something which would have
involved lending a total amount substantially in excess of any of the
successive valuations. They never intended to lend more than £289,000 of new
money. The concept of collateral benefits is concerned with collateral matters.
It cannot be deployed so as to deem the very transaction which gave rise to the
loss to be other than it was.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>This is why the decision of Toulson J in <i>Komercni Banka AS v Stone
and Rolls Ltd</i> [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 383, which was pressed on us as an
analogy, was ultimately unhelpful. Toulson J was concerned with a complex series
of frauds against a bank under which part of the proceeds of one fraud found
its way back to the bank via a third party to serve as pump priming for
distinct, further frauds. He declined to reduce the damages by the amount of
these circular payments, because they were not an intrinsic part of the relevant
venture or transaction but were simply “the result of [the fraudster’s]
independent choice how to use the opportunity created by his fraud” (para 171).
I doubt whether much is to be gained by analogies with other cases decided on
their own peculiar facts, but <i>Komercni Banka</i> does not even offer a
relevant analogy.</a></p><a name="para14">

</span>For these reasons, which correspond to those given by the Deputy
Judge and by McCombe LJ in his dissenting judgment, I would allow the appeal. The
reasons are of course sensitive to the facts, including those facts which are
disputed and have been assumed for the purposes of this appeal. In particular,
different considerations might arise were it to be alleged that the valuers
were negligent in relation to both facilities. The Deputy Judge’s order was
carefully drawn so as to address the point of principle while leaving these matters
open. Subject to any submissions that may be made about the exact form of relief,
I would restore his order.</a></p><a name="para15">
