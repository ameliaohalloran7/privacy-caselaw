<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This litigation arises from alleged toxic emissions from the Nchanga
Copper Mine in the Chingola District of Zambia. The claimants, who are the
respondents to this appeal, are a group currently consisting of some 1,826
Zambian citizens who live in four communities within the Chingola District.
They are, by any standards, very poor members of rural farming communities
served by watercourses which provide their only source of water for drinking
(by themselves and their livestock) and irrigation for their crops. They say
that both their health and their farming activities have been damaged by
repeated discharges of toxic matter from the Nchanga Copper Mine into those
watercourses, from 2005 to date.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Nchanga Copper Mine (“the Mine”) consists, in part, of an open-cast
mine, said to be the second largest in the world, and in part of a deep mine.
Its immediate owner is the second defendant Konkola Copper Mines plc (“KCM”),
which is a public company incorporated in Zambia. KCM is the largest private
employer in Zambia, employing some 16,000 people, mainly at the Mine. The first
defendant Vedanta Resources plc (“Vedanta”) is the ultimate parent company of
KCM. It is the parent of a multinational group, listed on the London Stock
Exchange, with interests in minerals, power, oil and gas in four continents.
Vedanta is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Although Vedanta
claims only to have 19 employees of its own, eight of whom are its directors,
the Vedanta Group employs some 82,000 people worldwide. KCM is not a 100%
subsidiary of Vedanta, since the Zambian government has a significant minority
stake, but materials published by Vedanta state that its ultimate control of
KCM is not thereby to be regarded as any less than it would be if wholly owned.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claims against both defendants are pleaded in common law negligence
and breach of statutory duty. Those causes of action are pursued against KCM on
the basis that it is the operator of the Mine. As against Vedanta, the same
causes of action are said to arise by reason of the “very high level of control
and direction that the first defendant exercised at all material times over the
mining operations of the second defendant and its compliance with applicable
health, safety and environmental standards”: (Particulars of Claim, para 79).</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>This appeal is all (and only) about jurisdiction; that is, the
jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to determine those claims
against both defendants. As against Vedanta, the claimants rely upon article 4
of the Recast Brussels Regulation (Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 on Jurisdiction
and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial
Matters). As against KCM the claimants rely upon what may loosely be called the
“necessary or proper party” gateway of the English procedural code for
permitting service of proceedings out of the jurisdiction, now to be found
mainly in para 3.1 of CPR Practice Direction 6B.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The procedural background to this appeal is, in outline, as follows. The
claimants issued the Claim Form in July 2015. Vedanta was served within the
jurisdiction. Service was effected on KCM out of the jurisdiction pursuant to
permission obtained on a without-notice application on 19 August 2015. Both
Vedanta and KCM applied to challenge jurisdiction, in September and October
2015 respectively. Their applications were heard together, over three days in
April 2016, by Coulson J, who delivered a comprehensive reserved judgment
dismissing them on 27 May 2016 </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2016/975.html">[2016] EWHC 975 (TCC)</a>. The defendants’ appeals
were heard over two days in July 2017 and dismissed, again in a comprehensive
reserved judgment, in October 2017 <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/1528.html">[2018] 1 WLR 3575</a>. The defendants’ further
appeals to this court were heard, again over two full days, in January 2019.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Proportionality</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary to say something at the outset about the
disproportionate way in which these jurisdiction issues have been litigated. In
<i>Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd </i>(“<i>the Spiliada</i>”) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html">[1987] AC 460</a>, 465, Lord Templeman said this, about what was, even then, the
disproportionate manner in which jurisdiction challenges were litigated:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the result, it seems to me
that the solution of disputes about the relative merits of trial in England and
trial abroad is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge. Commercial Court
judges are very experienced in these matters. In nearly every case evidence is
on affidavit by witnesses of acknowledged probity. I hope that in future the
judge will be allowed to study the evidence and refresh his memory of the
speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Goff of Chieveley in this case in the
quiet of his room without expense to the parties; that he will not be referred
to other decisions on other facts; and that submissions will be measured in
hours and not days. An appeal should be rare and the appellate court should be
slow to interfere.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That dictum is, in my mind equally applicable to all the
judges in what are now the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales,
including, as in this case, the Technology and Construction Court.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That requirement for proportionality, and for respect to be given to
first instance decisions on jurisdiction, has been repeated, perhaps in less
colourful terms, in numerous subsequent cases. In <i>VTB Capital plc v Nutritek
International Corpn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/5.html">[2013] 2 AC 337</a>, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury said
this, at paras 82 to 83:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“82.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point is that
hearings concerning the issue of appropriate forum should not involve masses of
documents, long witness statements, detailed analysis of the issues, and long
argument. It is self-defeating if, in order to determine whether an action
should proceed to trial in this jurisdiction, the parties prepare for and
conduct a hearing which approaches the putative trial itself, in terms of
effort, time and cost. There is also a real danger that, if the hearing is an
expensive and time-consuming exercise, it will be used by a richer party to
wear down a poorer party, or by a party with a weak case to prevent, or at
least to discourage, a party with a strong case from enforcing its rights.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite apart from this,
it is simply disproportionate for parties to incur costs, often running to
hundreds of thousands of pounds each, and to spend many days in court, on such
a hearing. The essentially relevant factors should, in the main at any rate, be
capable of being identified relatively simply and, in many respects,
uncontroversially. There is little point in going into much detail: when
determining such applications, the court can only form preliminary views on
most of the relevant legal issues and cannot be anything like certain about which
issues and what evidence will eventuate if the matter proceeds to trial.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 84 Lord Neuberger cited dicta to the same effect by Waller LJ in
<i>Cherney v Deripaska (No 2)</i> [2010] 2 All ER (Comm) 456, para 7, in which
he concluded that it “would have been better for both parties and better use of
court time if they had expended their money and their energy on fighting the
merits of the claim”.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction challenges frequently raise questions about whether the
claim against one or more of the defendants raises a triable issue. As it is
now common ground, this broadly replicates the summary judgment test. Issues of
this kind are, regardless whether contained within jurisdiction disputes,
subject to a similar requirement for proportionality, the avoidance of
mini-trials and the exercise of judicial restraint, in particular in complex
cases, as was emphasised in the following well known passage from the speech of
Lord Hope of Craighead in <i>Three Rivers District Council v Governor and
Company of the Bank of England (No 3) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/16.html">[2003] 2 AC 1</a>:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons which I
have just given, I think that the question is whether the claim has no real
prospect of succeeding at trial and that it has to be answered having regard to
the overriding objective of dealing with the case justly. But the point which
is of crucial importance lies in the answer to the further question that then
needs to be asked, which is - what is to be the scope of that inquiry?</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would approach that
further question in this way. The method by which issues of fact are tried in
our courts is well settled. After the normal processes of discovery and
interrogatories have been completed, the parties are allowed to lead their
evidence so that the trial judge can determine where the truth lies in the
light of that evidence. To that rule there are some well-recognised exceptions.
For example, it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a
party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will
not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks. In that event a trial of the facts
would be a waste of time and money, and it is proper that the action should be
taken out of court as soon as possible. In other cases it may be possible to
say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is
fanciful because it is entirely without substance. It may be clear beyond
question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or
other material on which it is based. The simpler the case the easier it is
likely to be to take that view and resort to what is properly called summary
judgment. But more complex cases are unlikely to be capable of being resolved
in that way without conducting a mini-trial on the documents without discovery
and without oral evidence. As Lord Woolf said in <i>Swain v Hillman</i> [<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/3053.html">[2001] 1 All ER 91</a>], at p 95, that is not the object of the rule. It is designed to
deal with cases that are not fit for trial at all.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Wenlock v Moloney</i>
[1965] 1 WLR 1238 the plaintiff’s claim of damages for conspiracy was struck
out after a four day hearing on affidavits and documents. Danckwerts LJ said of
the inherent power of the court to strike out, at p 1244B-C:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘this summary jurisdiction of the
court was never intended to be exercised by a minute and protracted examination
of the documents and facts of the case, in order to see whether the plaintiff
really has a cause of action. To do that is to usurp the position of the trial
judge, and to produce a trial of the case in chambers, on affidavits only,
without discovery and without oral evidence tested by cross-examination in the
ordinary way. This seems to me to be an abuse of the inherent power of the
court and not a proper exercise of that power.’”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10">10. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The extent to which these well-known warnings have been ignored in this
litigation can be measured by the following statistics about the materials
placed before this court. The parties’ two written cases (ignoring annexes) ran
to 294 pages. The electronic bundles included 8,945 pages. No less than 142
authorities were deployed, spread over 13 bundles, in relation to an appeal
which, on final analysis, involved only one difficult point of law.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A particular reason for the requirement to exercise proportionality in
jurisdiction disputes of this kind is that, in most cases, they involve a
contest between two competing jurisdictions in either of which the parties
could obtain substantial justice. The exception, an issue whether substantial
justice is obtainable in one of the competing jurisdictions, may require a
deeper level of scrutiny, not least because a conclusion that a foreign
jurisdiction would not provide substantial justice risks offending
international comity. Such a finding requires cogent evidence, which may
properly be subjected to anxious scrutiny. Nonetheless, the fact that such an
issue arises in a particular case (as in this appeal) is no excuse for ignoring
the requirement for proportionality in relation to all the other issues.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judicial restraint is of particular importance in relation to
jurisdiction disputes which, wholly exceptionally, reach this court, in
particular in cases such as the present, where the Court of Appeal has already
concurred with the fact-finding and evaluative analysis of the first instance
judge. The essential business of this court is to deal with issues of law,
rather than fact-finding or the re-exercise of discretion. The pursuit of
detailed matters of factual (or evaluative) analysis in this court is therefore
inappropriate, both because it is likely to involve a needless and useless
misapplication of the parties’ time and resources, and because it distracts
this court from its proper focus upon real issues of law.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor is it permissible to dress up what is in reality a factual dispute
as if it were, or involved, a misdirection in law by the first instance judge.
As will appear, a telling example in the present case is the appellants’
assertion that Coulson J applied an insufficiently rigorous or detailed
analysis of the claimants’ pleaded case against Vedanta, for the purpose of
deciding whether it disclosed a real issue to be tried. Within every
jurisdiction dispute, or embedded question whether there is a triable issue,
the first instance judge faces a typical quandary: how to balance the
requirement for proportionality against the need to ensure that resources are
not wasted on an unnecessary trial. The choice, at how deep a level of detail
to conduct that analysis and then in how much detail to express conclusions in
a judgment, are matters for the experienced first instance judge, with which an
appellate court should be slow to interfere.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that it has been necessary, despite frequent judicial
pronouncements to the same effect, yet again to emphasise the requirements of
proportionality in relation to jurisdiction appeals, suggests that, unless
condign costs consequences are made to fall upon litigants, and even their
professional advisors, who ignore these requirements, this court will find

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although technically there are two appeals, one by each of the
defendants, they are closely interrelated and the proceedings before this court
are best understood as a single appeal. The issues, and the interrelationship
between them, can most easily be summarised by reference to the structure
applicable to the establishment of jurisdiction in claims against defendants
one of which is domiciled within, and the other without, the jurisdiction of
the English court. The defendant domiciled here will be referred to as “the
anchor defendant”. The defendant domiciled abroad will be referred to as “the
foreign defendant”. The essential structure is common ground and may therefore
be briefly summarised.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction against the anchor defendant derives directly from article
4.1 of the Recast Brussels Regulation, which provides that:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Subject to this Regulation,
persons domiciled in a member state shall, whatever their nationality, be sued
in the courts of that member state.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para16">That basic provision is designed not only for the
protection of EU domiciliaries, but also to enable a claimant to know, with
reasonable certainty, where he may sue. In </a><a name="_Hlk535839995"><i>Owusu </i></a><i>v
Jackson</i> (Case C-281/02) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C28102.html">[2005] QB 801</a> the Court of Justice held, contrary
to earlier English jurisprudence, that this conferred a right on any claimant
(regardless of their domicile) to sue an English domiciled defendant in
England, free from jurisdictional challenge upon forum non conveniens grounds,
even where the competing candidates for jurisdiction were England (part of a member
state) and some other non-member state such as, here, Zambia. The decision
related to article 2 of the earlier Convention on Jurisdiction and the
Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968, which was in
identical terms to the present Recast Brussels Regulation.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This does not, of course, prevent any defendant from seeking to have a
claim struck out as an abuse of process or as disclosing no reasonable cause of
action, or from seeking reverse summary judgment upon the basis that the claim
discloses no triable issue against that defendant. Vedanta has not pursued a
strike-out or summary judgment application of that kind, but both it and KCM
assert that the claimants’ pleaded case and supporting evidence disclose no
real triable issue against Vedanta, because Vedanta cannot be shown to have
done anything in relation to the operation of the Mine sufficient either to
give rise to a common law duty of care in favour of the claimants, or a
statutory liability as a participant in breaches of Zambian environmental
protection, mining and public health legislation. Vedanta was, it is said,
merely an indirect owner of KCM, and no more than that.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, Vedanta maintains that, even if the pleaded claim discloses a
triable issue against it, nonetheless the claim should be stayed as an abuse of
EU law, because the claimants are using a claim against Vedanta in England
purely as a vehicle for attracting English jurisdiction against their real
target defendant, KCM, by means of the necessary or proper party gateway.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both these submissions were rejected by the judge, and by the Court of
Appeal, but are pursued here, with the requisite permission of this court.
Further, the appellants submit that the issue as to abuse of EU law deserves a
reference to the Court of Justice.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimants’ invocation of English jurisdiction as against KCM
depends, as already noted, upon the necessary or proper party gateway. This
forms a long-established part of English private international law which,
pursuant to article 6.1 of the Recast Brussels Regulation, is determinative of
the jurisdiction of the English courts against a defendant, like KCM, not
domiciled in a member state. The necessary or proper party gateway long
ante-dates the Civil Procedure Rules but is now enshrined in Part 6 Practice
Direction B para 3.1 as follows:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The claimant may serve a claim
form out of the jurisdiction with the permission of the court under rule 6.36
where -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A claim is made against
a person (‘the defendant’) on whom the claim form has been or will be served
(otherwise than in reliance on this paragraph) and -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is between the
claimant and the defendant a real issue which it is reasonable for the court to
try; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the claimant wishes to
serve the claim form on another person who is a necessary or proper party to
that claim.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The express terms of the Practice Direction set out only
part of what a claimant relying upon the necessary or proper party gateway must
show. It is common ground that, by reference to those terms and well-settled
authority, the claimant must demonstrate as follows:</p>

</span>that, either, England is the proper place in which to bring the combined
claims or that there is a real risk that the claimants will not obtain
substantial justice in the alternative foreign jurisdiction, even if it would

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As already noted, the question whether the claims disclose a real
triable issue against Vedanta is a main issue on this appeal. It is however
accepted that, if the claimants surmount this hurdle, it would be reasonable
for the English court to try that issue, and that KCM would be at least a
proper party to the claims against Vedanta. It is also (now) common ground that
the claims against KCM have a real prospect of success.</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>Both the judge and the Court of Appeal found in the claimants’ favour on
real issue and proper place. In addition, they both found that, even if Zambia
would otherwise have been the proper place in which to bring the claims, there
was a real risk that the claimants would not obtain substantial justice in the
Zambian jurisdiction. Those questions remain in issue on this appeal. In the
remainder of this judgment, the issues will be addressed in the following
order:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="ParaHeading">Abuse of EU law</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The essence of the appellants’ case under this heading may be summarised
as follows. First, it is an abuse of EU law to use article 4 of the Recast
Brussels Regulation as a means of enabling claimants to establish jurisdiction
against an anchor defendant for the collateral purpose of attracting a member state’s
international jurisdiction against foreign defendants, who are the real targets
of the claim. It is said that, whereas article 4 is designed to protect
defendants domiciled within the EU, this abuse exposes to litigation domiciled
parent companies who would not, apart from their status as anchor defendants,
otherwise be sued at all.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge’s response was to acknowledge that there might be an abuse if
the pursuit of the anchor defendant had been for the sole purpose of attracting
jurisdiction as against the foreign defendant, but not otherwise. He found, on
the facts, that although the prospect of attracting jurisdiction against KCM
was a substantial reason why the claimants sued Vedanta in England, it was not
their only reason. They had a bona fide claim, disclosing a real issue for
trial, against Vedanta and a desire to obtain judgment against Vedanta rather
than merely against KCM, because of a perception, supported by some evidence,
that KCM might prove to be of doubtful solvency.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Faced with those findings of fact as to the claimants’ motivation, the
appellants pursue this ground of appeal upon the basis that the judge’s
application of a “sole purpose” test for abuse of EU law was too narrow or, at
least, not <i>acte clair</i>, thereby necessitating a reference to the Court of
Justice.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the purposes of analysis, the abuse of EU law claim needs to be
approached upon the assumption, but without at this stage deciding, that the
claim discloses a real triable issue as against Vedanta. If it does not, then
Vedanta falls away as an anchor defendant, and the necessary or proper party
gateway, as against KCM, closes. Furthermore, as will appear, I consider that
the judge’s conclusion that the claim discloses a real triable issue as against
Vedanta cannot be overturned in this court.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor can the judge’s conclusion that Vedanta was not sued by the
claimants in England for the sole purpose of attracting English jurisdiction
over KCM be challenged on this appeal. His conclusion that Vedanta was sued in
England for the genuine purpose of obtaining damages, albeit that attracting
English jurisdiction over KCM was an important contributor to that decision,
was a finding of fact. Although arrived at by a necessarily summary process
which did not permit cross-examination of the claimants’ witness evidence as to
motive, it was well supported by evidence that the claimants risked finding,
after obtaining judgment against KCM, that it was unable to pay the judgment
debt. The judge’s findings of fact on this issue were endorsed by the Court of
Appeal (at para 38 per Simon LJ). They were final findings, in the sense that
those factual issues will not be revisited at any later stage in the
proceedings. It is contrary to the practice of this court to re-open concurrent
factual findings made in both the courts below. To be fair, counsel for each of
the appellants made no significant effort to do so.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I therefore approach the legal analysis of this abuse of EU law issue on
the basis that:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the claimants have pleaded a real triable issue against Vedanta;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the claimants genuinely desire to obtain judgment for damages against
Vedanta; but,</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>one of the principal reasons (although not the sole reason) why the
claimants sued Vedanta in England was so as to be able, by the use of article 4
and the necessary or proper party gateway in conjunction, to sue KCM in England
as well.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On that factual basis, I am satisfied, to the extent that the point is <i>acte</i>
<i>clair</i>, that the EU principle of abuse of law does not avail the
appellants. The starting point is the need to recognise that, following <i>Owusu
v Jackson, </i>what is now article 4.1 lays down the primary rule regulating
the jurisdiction of each member state to entertain claims against persons
domiciled in that state. The Recast Brussels Regulation itself (like its
predecessors) contains a number of express provisions which derogate from that
primary rule. As exceptions to it, they are all to be narrowly construed. If,
therefore, the Recast Brussels Regulation also contains (as it probably does)
an implied exception from the otherwise automatic and mandatory effect of article
4, based upon abuse of EU law, then that is also an exception which is to be
narrowly construed.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The centrality of article 4, as the basis of member states’ jurisdiction
over their own domiciliaries, is laid down not only in <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>
itself, but in a series of later authorities, and fully recognised by academic
writers, even those who, prior to <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>, had taken the
opposite view where the relevant competition between jurisdictions lay between
a member state and a non-member state. Decisions of the Court of Justice which
have re-emphasised the centrality of article 4, and the need to construe any
exceptions or derogations from it restrictively, include <i>Melzer v MF Global
UK Ltd</i> (Case C-228/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C22811.html">[2013] QB 1112</a>, at paras 23 to 24 of the judgment.
Dicta in the English courts to the same effect include, in this court, <i>A v A
(Children: Habitual Residence)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/60.html">[2014] AC 1</a>, per Lady Hale at para 31 and,
more recently, <i>AMT Futures Ltd v Marzillier, Dr Meier &amp; Dr Guntner
Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/13.html">[2018] AC 439</a>, per Lord Hodge at para 13.
Distinguished academics who are (now) of the same view include Professor Adrian
Briggs who in <i>Private International Law in English Courts</i> (2014), at
para 4.362, concludes that, since <i>Owusu,</i> “the ship has now sailed” and in
<i>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</i>, 6th ed (2015), at para 2.304, that “the
answer is clear, and debate has moved on”. Of the same view are (now) the
editors of Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on <i>Conflict of Laws</i>, 15th ed
(2012), at para 12-020.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are a small number of cases in the Court of Justice where either
the Court or the Advocate General has addressed specifically the question of
abuse of law in the context of the Recast Brussels Regulation and its
predecessors. They mainly concern the alleged abusive use of article 8.1
(formerly article 6.1) as a means of circumventing article 4 (formerly article
2). Article 8.1 contains provision (in a much more mechanical form than the
English </a><a name="_Hlk535848159">forum conveniens </a>doctrine) for a limited
departure from article 4, by providing that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A person domiciled in a member state
may also be sued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:0cm">1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place
where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely
connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the
risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings; …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is therefore a limited form of necessary or proper
party gateway out of the strictures of article 4. When read with the enabling
words of article 5, it gives the claimant a choice to sue an EU domiciled
defendant in a member state other than that of its domicile in order to avoid
the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is of no direct relevance in the
present case because there is no co-defendant to the claim against Vedanta
domiciled in another member state. Since article 8.1 is itself to be
restrictively interpreted because it derogates from the primary rule of
jurisdiction in article 4, it might be thought that the Court of Justice would
liberally apply an abuse of law principle where it perceived that article 8 was
being misused as a means of circumventing article 4. Nonetheless the cases show
that abuse of EU law has been restrictively interpreted, even in that context.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

claimant sought to use article 6.1 of the Judgments Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 (the
predecessor of article 8.1) as a means of invoking the jurisdiction of the
Swedish courts over a claim against an English company, because a Swedish
company was a co-defendant. One of the objections raised by the English
defendant was that the claimant was making an abusive use of article 6.1, by
joining the Swedish company as a vehicle for that purpose, so as to disable the
primary rule (then in article 2) requiring the English company to be sued in
England. At para 66 of his opinion, Advocate General Mengozzi said that in
order to disapply article 6.1 it would be necessary to show not merely that the
claimant had joined the Swedish defendant for the “sole object of removing one
of those defendants from the courts of his own domicile” but also that it would
be necessary to show, not merely fraudulent or wrongful intent, but “that the
action bought against the defendant domiciled in the forum member state appears
to be unfounded … manifestly unfounded in all respects - to the point of
proving to be contrived - or devoid of any real interest for the claimant”.</p>

(Evonik Degussa GmbH intervening) </i>(Case C-352/13) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C35213.html">[2015] QB 906</a> was another
case about an alleged abuse of article 6.1 in an international cartel case
against defendants domiciled in a number of member states. It was said that the
claimants had deliberately delayed settlement of a claim against a German
defendant for the purpose of attracting the jurisdiction of the German courts
against co-defendants domiciled in other member states, thereby committing an
abuse of article 6.1. Advocate General Jääskinen advised, at para 84 of his
opinion, that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In accordance with the court’s
consistent case law, ‘the rule [on jurisdiction laid down in article 6(1) of
the Brussels I Regulation] cannot be interpreted in such a way as to allow a
plaintiff to make a claim against a number of defendants for <i>the sole
purpose of removing </i>one of them from the jurisdiction of the courts of the member
state in which that defendant is domiciled’ (my emphasis).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In its judgment, the Court of Justice expressly affirmed that opinion in
para 27, adding at para 33 that in the context of cartel cases nothing short of
collusion between the claimant and the anchor defendant would be sufficient to
engage the abuse of law principle.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Those decisions of the Court of Justice show that, even before the <i>Freeport</i>
case, there was an established line of authority which limited the use of the
abuse of EU law principle as a means of circumventing article 6 (now article 8)
to cases where the ability to sue a defendant otherwise than in the member state
of its domicile was the sole purpose of the joinder of the anchor defendant.
Even though there appears to be no authority directly upon abuse of EU law in
relation to article 4 itself (or its predecessors), the need to construe any
express or implied derogation from article 4 restrictively would appear to make
the position <span style="color:#222222">a </span></a><a name="_Hlk535917216">fortiori</a>
in relation to article 4, as indeed the judge himself held.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the matter does not stop there. Such jurisprudence as there is about
abuse of EU law in relation to jurisdiction suggests that the abuse of law
doctrine is limited to the collusive invocation of one EU principle so as
improperly to subvert another. In the present case the position is quite
different. The complaint is that article 4 is being used as a means of
circumventing or misusing the English national regime for the identification of
its international jurisdiction over persons not domiciled in any member state:
ie the forum conveniens jurisprudence and, specifically, the necessary or
proper party gateway.</a></p><a name="para36">

</span>This complaint forms a central theme in the appellants’ submissions not
only about abuse of EU law, but also about the necessary or proper party gateway
itself. It is worth close examination at this stage because, to the extent that
it is well founded, it raises the question whether the remedy (if any) for its
adverse consequences is to be found in EU law or in the English private
international law traditionally called the forum conveniens<i> </i>doctrine.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>Prior to <i>Owusu v Jackson</i> (although, as is now recognised,
illegitimately once the UK had become a member state) the English courts took a
two-handed approach to any attempt to use the ability to serve an anchor
defendant (domiciled in England) as of right, coupled with invocation of the
necessary or proper party gateway as the basis for obtaining permission to
serve a foreign defendant out of the jurisdiction in cases where, leaving aside
the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the natural forum was the jurisdiction
where the foreign defendant was domiciled. With one hand, the court could
refuse (or set aside) permission to serve the foreign defendant out of the
jurisdiction. With the other hand the court could stay the proceedings against
the anchor defendant, in both cases on the basis that the foreign jurisdiction
was the forum conveniens (or using the CPR English equivalent, the “proper
place”) for the conduct of the litigation as a whole. By dealing with the
claims against both defendants, the English court thereby neatly avoided the
risk of irreconcilable judgments or multiplicity of proceedings.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following <i>Owusu v Jackson </i>the English court has one hand tied
behind its back. No more can it stay the proceedings against the anchor
defendant on forum conveniens grounds. This is the precise ratio of <i>Owusu v
Jackson</i>, and the Court of Justice was fully aware of the difficulties which
that conclusion would be likely to cause in the traditional exercise of the
English court’s forum conveniens<i> </i>jurisprudence in such cases. The result
is, in a case (such as the present) where the English court is persuaded that,
whatever happens to the claim against the foreign defendant, the claimants will
in fact continue in England against the anchor defendant, the risk of
irreconcilable judgments becomes a formidable, often insuperable, obstacle to
the identification of any jurisdiction other than England as the forum
conveniens. Thus not only is one of the court’s hands tied behind its back, but
the other is, in many cases, effectively paralysed. In the context of group
litigation about environmental harm, the appellants say that it has the almost
inevitable effect that, providing a minimum level of triable issue can be
identified against an English incorporated parent, then litigation about
environmental harm all around the world can be carried on in England, wherever
the immediate cause of the damage arises from the operations of one of that
group’s overseas subsidiaries.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Two consequences flow from that analysis. The first is that, leaving
aside those cases where the claimant has no genuine intention to seek a remedy
against the anchor defendant, the fact that article 4 fetters and paralyses the
English forum conveniens jurisprudence in this way in a necessary or proper
party case cannot itself be said to be an abuse of EU law, in a context where
those difficulties were expressly recognised by the Court of Justice when
providing that forum conveniens arguments could not be used by way of
derogation from what is now article 4. The second is that to allow those very
real concerns to serve as the basis for an assertion of abuse of EU law would
be to erect a forum conveniens argument as the basis for a derogation from article
4, which is the very thing that the Court of Justice held in <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>
to be impermissible. In my view, if there is a remedy for this undoubted
problem, it lies in an appropriate adjustment of the English forum conveniens
jurisprudence, not so as to permit the English court to stay the proceedings
against the anchor defendant, if genuinely pursued for a real remedy, but
rather to temper the rigour of the need to avoid irreconcilable judgments which
has, thus far, served to disable the English court from concluding that any
jurisdiction other than its own is the forum conveniens or proper place for the
litigation of the claim against the foreign defendant. As will appear, I
consider that there is a solution to this difficulty along those lines, where
the anchor defendant is prepared to submit to the jurisdiction of the domicile
of the foreign defendant in a case where, as here, the foreign jurisdiction
would plainly be the proper place, leaving aside the risk of irreconcilable
judgments.</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>For those reasons I would resolve the abuse of EU law issue in favour of
the claimants, without any need for a reference to the Court of Justice.</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="ParaHeading">Real issue to be tried as against Vedanta</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The single task of the judge under this heading was to decide whether
the claim against Vedanta could be disposed of, and rejected, summarily,
without the need for a trial. This is because, although Vedanta made no reverse
summary judgment application of its own, the assertion by a foreign defendant
seeking to set aside permission to serve outside the jurisdiction under the
necessary or proper party gateway that the claim against the anchor defendant
discloses no real issue to be tried involves, as is now agreed, a summary
judgment test: see <i>Altimo Holdings and Investment Ltd v Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2011/7.html">[2012] 1 WLR 1804</a>, per Lord Collins of Mapesbury at para 82. That was a case
about the civil procedure rules of the Isle of Man but the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council treated those provisions as in substance no different in
their effect from those in the English Civil Procedure Rules: see para 67.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43">43. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Summary judgment disputes arise typically, and real triable issue
jurisdiction disputes arise invariably, at a very early stage in the
proceedings. In the context of a jurisdiction challenge the court will,
typically, have only the claimant’s pleadings. Proportionality effectively
prohibits cross-examination and neither party will have had the benefit of
disclosure of the opposing party’s documents, albeit that in exceptional
circumstances a direction for limited specific disclosure may be given: see <i>Rome
v Punjab National Bank (No 1)</i> [1989] 2 All ER 136, per Hirst J, para 141
and <i>Flatela Vava v Anglo American South Africa Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2012/1969.html">[2012] EWHC 1969 (QB)</a>. No order for limited disclosure was sought or made in the present case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The extent to which the absence of disclosure of defendants’ documents
may impede claimants in demonstrating a triable issue depends of course upon what
are said to be the defects in its case. In the present case the critical
question is whether Vedanta sufficiently intervened in the management of the
Mine owned by its subsidiary KCM to have incurred, itself (rather than by
vicarious liability), a common law duty of care to the claimants or, (on the
claimants’ expert evidence), a fault-based liability under the Zambian
environmental, mining and public health legislation in connection with the
escapes of toxic materials from the Mine alleged to have caused the relevant
harm. The level of intervention in the management of the Mine requisite to give
rise to a duty of care upon Vedanta to persons living, farming and working in
the vicinity is (as is agreed) a matter of Zambian law, but the question whether
that level of intervention occurred in the present case is a pure question of
fact. I make no apology for having suggested during argument that it is
blindingly obvious that the proof of that particular pudding would depend
heavily upon the contents of documents internal to each of the defendant
companies, and upon correspondence and other documents passing between them,
currently unavailable to the claimants, but in due course disclosable.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This poses a familiar dilemma for judges dealing with applications for
summary judgment. On the one hand, the claimant cannot simply say, like Mr
Micawber, that some gaping hole in its case may be remedied by something which
may turn up on disclosure. The claimant must demonstrate that it has a case
which is unsuitable to be determined adversely to it without a trial. On the
other, the court cannot ignore reasonable grounds which may be disclosed at the
summary judgment stage for believing that a fuller investigation of the facts
may add to or alter the evidence relevant to the issue: see <i>Tesco Stores Ltd
v Mastercard Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2015/1145.html">[2015] EWHC 1145</a>, per Asplin J at para 73.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46">46. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The main thrust of the appellants’ case under this heading was that a
conclusion that Vedanta had incurred a duty of care to the claimants would
involve a novel and controversial extension of the boundaries of the tort of
negligence, beyond any established category, calling for a cautious incremental
approach by analogy with established categories, which therefore required a
detailed investigation of the claimants’ case, which neither the judge nor the
Court of Appeal carried out<i>.</i></a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was submitted therefore that this court needed to carry out that
detailed analysis. For that purpose Mr Charles Gibson QC for KCM undertook,
mainly in writing, a thorough review of the appellants’ published documents
describing their relationship, and Mr Richard Hermer QC for the claimants
responded in kind, albeit to some extent under protest that this was not an
exercise which this court ought to undertake.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might be thought that an assertion that the claim against Vedanta
raised a novel and controversial issue in the common law of negligence made it
inherently unsuitable for summary determination. It is well settled that
difficult issues of law of that kind are best resolved once all the facts have
been ascertained at a trial, rather than upon the necessarily abbreviated and
hypothetical basis of pleadings or assumed facts.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants’ submission that this case involves the assertion of a
new category of common law negligence liability arises from the fact that,
although the claimants chose to plead their case by seeking to fit its alleged
facts within a series of four <i>indicia </i>given by the Court of Appeal in <i>Chandler
v Cape plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/525.html">[2012] 1 WLR 3111</a>, it was submitted that this was by no means a <i>Chandler</i>
type of case. It may, like the claim in the <i>Chandler</i> case, loosely be
categorised as a claim that a parent company has incurred a common law duty of
care to persons (in this case neighbours rather than employees) harmed by the
activities of one of its subsidiaries. But the liability of parent companies in
relation to the activities of their subsidiaries is not, of itself, a distinct
category of liability in common law negligence. Direct or indirect ownership by
one company of all or a majority of the shares of another company (which is the
irreducible essence of a parent/subsidiary relationship) may enable the parent
to take control of the management of the operations of the business or of land
owned by the subsidiary, but it does not impose any duty upon the parent to do
so, whether owed to the subsidiary or, a <span style="color:#222222">fortiori,
to anyone else. Everything depends on the extent to which, and the way in
which, the parent availed itself of the opportunity to take over, intervene in,
control, supervise or advise the management of the relevant operations
(including land use) of the subsidiary. All that the existence of a parent
subsidiary relationship demonstrates is that the parent had such an
opportunity.</span></p>

</span>Mr Gibson and Mr Hermer were eventually ad idem<i> </i>in commending to
the court the pithy and in my view correct summary of this point by Sales LJ in
<i>AAA v Unilever plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1532.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 1532</a>, para 36:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is no special doctrine in
the law of tort of legal responsibility on the part of a parent company in
relation to the activities of its subsidiary, vis-à-vis persons affected by
those activities. Parent and subsidiary are separate legal persons, each with responsibility
for their own separate activities. A parent company will only be found to be
subject to a duty of care in relation to an activity of its subsidiary if
ordinary, general principles of the law of tort regarding the imposition of a
duty of care on the part of the parent in favour of a claimant are satisfied in
the particular case. The legal principles are the same as would apply in
relation to the question whether any third party (such as a consultant giving
advice to the subsidiary) was subject to a duty of care in tort owed to a
claimant dealing with the subsidiary. Helpful guidance as to relevant
considerations was given in <i>Chandler v Cape plc</i>; but that case did not
lay down a separate test, distinct from general principle, for the imposition
of a duty of care in relation to a parent company.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He continued, at para 37:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although the legal principles are
the same, it may be that on the facts of a particular case a parent company,
having greater scope to intervene in the affairs of its subsidiary than another
third party might have, has taken action of a kind which is capable of meeting
the relevant test for imposition of a duty of care in respect of the parent.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He proceeded then to provide typical examples, which
included this case, which had already by then been decided by the Court of
Appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51">51. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sales LJ thought that cases where the parent might incur a duty of care
to third parties harmed by the activities of the subsidiary would usually fall
into two basic types: (i) Where the parent has in substance taken over the
management of the relevant activity of the subsidiary in place of or jointly
with the subsidiary’s own management; (ii) Where the parent has given relevant
advice to the subsidiary about how it should manage a particular risk. For my
part, I would be reluctant to seek to shoehorn all cases of the parent’s
liability into specific categories of that kind, helpful though they will no
doubt often be for the purposes of analysis. There is no limit to the models of
management and control which may be put in place within a multinational group
of companies. At one end, the parent may be no more than a passive investor in
separate businesses carried out by its various direct and indirect
subsidiaries. At the other extreme, the parent may carry out a thoroughgoing
vertical reorganisation of the group’s businesses so that they are, in
management terms, carried on as if they were a single commercial undertaking, with
boundaries of legal personality and ownership within the group becoming
irrelevant, until the onset of insolvency, as happened within the Lehman
Brothers group.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Gibson sought to extract from the <i>Unilever</i> case and from <i>HRH
Emere Godwin Bebe Okpabi v Royal Dutch Shell plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/191.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 191</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/191.html">[2018] Bus LR 1022</a>, a general principle that a parent could never incur a duty
of care in respect of the activities of a particular subsidiary merely by
laying down group-wide policies and guidelines, and expecting the management of
each subsidiary to comply with them. This is, he submitted, all that the
evidence thus far deployed in the present case demonstrated about the Vedanta
Group. Again, I am not persuaded that there is any such reliable limiting
principle. Group guidelines about minimising the environmental impact of
inherently dangerous activities, such as mining, may be shown to contain
systemic errors which, when implemented as of course by a particular
subsidiary, then cause harm to third parties. In the <i>Chandler</i> case, the
subsidiary inherited (by taking over a business formerly carried on by the
parent) a system for the manufacture of asbestos which created an inherently
unsafe system of work for its employees, because it was carried on in factory
buildings with open sides, from which harmful asbestos dust could, and did,
escape. As a result, and after a full trial, the parent was found to have
incurred a duty of care to the employees of its subsidiary, and the result
would surely have been the same if the dust had escaped to neighbouring land
where third parties worked, lived or enjoyed recreation. It is difficult to see
why the parent’s responsibility would have been diminished if the unsafe system
of work, namely the manufacture of asbestos in open-sided factories, had formed
part of a group-wide policy and had been applied by asbestos manufacturing
subsidiaries around the world.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53">53. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even where group-wide policies do not of themselves give rise to such a
duty of care to third parties, they may do so if the parent does not merely
proclaim them, but takes active steps, by training, supervision and
enforcement, to see that they are implemented by relevant subsidiaries.
Similarly, it seems to me that the parent may incur the relevant responsibility
to third parties if, in published materials, it holds itself out as exercising
that degree of supervision and control of its subsidiaries, even if it does not
in fact do so. In such circumstances its very omission may constitute the
abdication of a responsibility which it has publicly undertaken.</a></p><a name="para53">

</span>Once it is recognised that, for these purposes, there is nothing special
or conclusive about the bare parent/subsidiary relationship, it is apparent
that the general principles which determine whether A owes a duty of care to C
in respect of the harmful activities of B are not novel at all. They may easily
be traced back as far as the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Dorset Yacht
Co Ltd v Home Office </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/2.html">[1970] AC 1004</a>, in which the negligent discharge by
the Home Office of its responsibility to supervise Borstal boys working on
Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour led to seven of them escaping and causing
serious damage to moored yachts in the vicinity, including one owned by the
plaintiff.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55">55. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The essence of the claimants’ case against Vedanta is that it exercised
a sufficiently high level of supervision and control of the activities at the
Mine, with sufficient knowledge of the propensity of those activities to cause
toxic escapes into surrounding watercourses, as to incur a duty of care to the
claimants. In the lengthy Particulars of Claim (in which this allegation of
duty of care, together with its particulars, occupied 13 pages) the claimants
make copious reference, including quoted highlights, to material published by
Vedanta in which it asserted its responsibility for the establishment of
appropriate group-wide environmental control and sustainability standards, for
their implementation throughout the group by training, and for their monitoring
and enforcement. The claimants have exhibited the underlying published
materials to witness statements, and relied, in addition, upon a management
services agreement between Vedanta and KCM and a witness statement of a Mr
Kakengela, a middle manager of KCM who gave evidence about changes in the mode
of management of the Mine after KCM became part of the Vedanta Group.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge’s approach to this issue may be summarised as follows. First,
he accepted that it was arguable that the Zambian courts would identify the
relevant principles of Zambian common law in accordance with those established
in England. It is now common ground that he was entitled on the evidence to do
so. Secondly, he accepted the invitation of counsel on both sides to treat <i>Caparo
Industries plc v Dickman </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html">[1990] 2 AC 605</a>, and its three ingredients of
foreseeability, proximity and reasonableness, as the starting point. This
assumed, contrary to my view, that he was dealing with a novel category of
common law negligence liability, but he can hardly be criticised for having
done so in the light of the parties’ joint invitation. Thirdly he was guided by
the claimants’ own pleaded case to focus upon the question whether the <a name="_Hlk535936180"><i>indicia</i></a><i> </i>in the <i>Chandler</i> case were
satisfied. In my view, and that of the Court of Appeal in this case, the <i>Chandler</i>
<i>indicia</i> are no more than particular examples of circumstances in which a
duty of care may affect a parent. They were so described by Arden LJ when
setting them out in the <i>Chandler</i> case. Although this if anything imposed
an unnecessary straitjacket, both upon the claimants and the judge, it did not
lead to the identification of a wider basis in law for the recognition of the
relevant parental duty of care than that which, in my view, the law actually
provides, by reference to basic principle.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Next, the judge reminded himself, correctly in my view, that the answer
to the question whether Vedanta incurred a duty of care to the claimants was
likely to depend upon a careful examination of materials produced only on
disclosure, and in particular upon documents held by Vedanta: see para 118. He
cautioned himself against embarking on any sort of mini-trial. At para 119 he
said this:</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the light of that view, it is
unnecessary for me to identify in any detail the evidence [on] which the claimants
rely in support of their case that Vedanta, as the parent company, owed a
relevant duty of care.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He then identified in four short sub-paragraphs the particular material
which supported his view that the claimants’ case was arguable. They included part
of the published material, namely a report entitled “Embedding Sustainability”
which, he said, stressed that the oversight of all Vedanta’s subsidiaries
rested with the board of Vedanta itself, made particular reference to problems
with discharges into water and to the particular problems arising at the Mine.
He relied upon the management services agreement between Vedanta and KCM to
which I have referred, upon a decision of the Irish High Court about the group (<i>Elmes
v Vedanta Lisheen Mining Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ie/cases/IEHC/2014/H73.html">[2014] IEHC 73</a>) and upon the witness statement
of Mr Kakengela. He concluded by recognising the need for a cautious approach
to the relevant evidence filed by KCM’s principal witness Mr Ndulo, whose
credibility he said had been subject to serious adverse comment (including a
finding of dishonesty) by a Commercial Court judge in an earlier case: see <i>U
&amp; M Mining Zambia Ltd v Konkola Copper Mines plc (No 3)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2014/3250.html">[2014] EWHC 3250 (Comm)</a>.</p>

</span>For its part the Court of Appeal followed a broadly similar course,
while reminding itself that the <i>Chandler</i> <i>indicia</i> were no more
than examples, and making a slightly different selection from the voluminous
evidence of those parts of Vedanta’s published statements indicative at least
of an arguable case for having undertaken a sufficiently close intervention
into the operation of the Mine to attract the requisite duty of care.</a></p><a name="para59">

</span>In my view the appellants’ primary submission under this heading, that
the judge and the Court of Appeal failed to apply sufficient rigour to their
analysis of the claimants’ pleadings and evidence on this question, fails <i>in
limine</i>. This was not a case of the assertion, for the first time, of a
novel and controversial new category of case for the recognition of a common
law duty of care, and it therefore required no added level of rigorous analysis
beyond that appropriate to any summary judgment application in a relatively
complex case. Nor does the judge’s judgment disclose any lack of appropriate
rigour. The question as to triable issue as against Vedanta was one of a
significantly larger number of contentious issues than those which have
survived in this court. The reason which the judge gave for the relative
brevity of his analysis of the underlying materials in para 119 of his judgment
said nothing about the depth and rigour of his own review of those materials.
He was merely seeking to explain why, in what was necessarily a long and
detailed judgment, having formed a clear view that the case against Vedanta was
arguable, it was unnecessary to burden his judgment with a lengthy and detailed
description of his own analysis. For the reasons I have already given, his
legal analysis may have departed slightly from the ideal, but only in respects
in which either he followed the parties’ joint invitation, or by imposing a straitjacket
derived from the <i>Chandler</i> case which, if anything, increased rather than
reduced the claimants’ burden in demonstrating a triable issue. But in that
respect those imperfections were largely cleared up by the Court of Appeal
which, rightly in my view, recognised that they did not undermine the judge’s
conclusion.</a></p><a name="para60">

</span>This court has, again, been taken at length through the relevant
underlying materials. For my part, if conducting the analysis afresh, I might have
been less persuaded than were either the judge or the Court of Appeal by the
management services agreement between the appellants, or by the evidence of Mr
Kakengela. But I regard the published materials in which Vedanta may fairly be
said to have asserted its own assumption of responsibility for the maintenance
of proper standards of environmental control over the activities of its
subsidiaries, and in particular the operations at the Mine, and not merely to
have laid down but also implemented those standards by training, monitoring and
enforcement, as sufficient on their own to show that it is well arguable that a
sufficient level of intervention by Vedanta in the conduct of operations at the
Mine may be demonstrable at trial, after full disclosure of the relevant
internal documents of Vedanta and KCM, and of communications passing between
them.</a></p><a name="para61">

</span>It matters not whether this court would have reached the same view as
did the judge about triable issue. It is sufficient that, for the reasons which
I have given, there was material upon which the judge could properly do so, and
that his assessment was not vitiated by any error of law.</a></p><a name="para62">

<p class="ParaHeading">Breach of statutory duty by Vedanta</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimants plead that, regardless whether Vedanta owed any common law
duty of care to them, its intervention in the operation of the Mine caused it
to commit breaches of duties imposed by Zambian statutes, even though KCM was
the sole licensed operator of the Mine. They are the Mines and Minerals
Development Act 2008, the Environmental Management Act 2011 and the
Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act 1990. Generally speaking
they impose strict liability on KCM but, according to the opinion of the
claimants’ Zambian law expert, they also impose a fault-based liability on a
wider range of persons. For example, section 4 of the Environmental Management
Act 2011 enables the court to compel “the person responsible for any
environmental degradation” to restore the environment to its status quo ante
and to provide compensation to any victim for the harm caused.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In paras 91 and following of the Particulars of Claim the same facts are
repeated as are relied upon for the assertion of a common law duty of care
against Vedanta by the repeated use of this rubric:</a></p><a name="para64">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the light of the matters
pleaded above and the First Defendant’s direction and control over the
operations of the Second Defendant …”</p>

</span>I must admit having some difficulty with the concept of a fault-based
liability which does not depend upon the existence of a prior legal duty to
take care. Nonetheless, it is reasonably clear from the claimants’ Zambian law
expert’s evidence (which for the purposes of testing an arguable case it is
agreed must be accepted, although vigorously challenged) that substantially the
same inquiry as to the extent of Vedanta’s intervention in the operation of the
Mine is required for the purpose of establishing breach by it of statutory
duty, as is required for the identification of a common law duty of care to the
claimants. It follows that no useful purpose is served by a minute examination
of issues about that statutory duty. Furthermore, once it is concluded that
there is no basis for going behind the judge’s conclusion that the claimants
had an arguable case in common law against Vedanta, the question whether or not
the claimants have an arguable statutory claim as well can make no difference
to the outcome of this appeal. For much the same reasons, both the judge and
the Court of Appeal dealt with the statutory basis of claim with commendable
brevity.</a></p><a name="para65">

<p class="ParaHeading">Is England the proper place in which to bring the claim
against KCM?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have found this to be the most difficult issue in this appeal. It does
raise an important question of law. CPR 6.37(3) provides that:</a></p><a name="para66">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The court will not give
permission [to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction] unless satisfied
that England and Wales is <i>the proper place in which to bring the claim</i>.”
(my emphasis)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The italicised phrase is the latest of a series of
attempts by English lawyers to label a long-standing concept. It has previously
been labelled forum conveniens and appropriate forum, but the changes in
language have more to do with the Civil Procedure Rules’ requirement to abjure
Latin, and to express procedural rules and concepts in plain English, than with
any intention to change the underlying meaning in any way. The best known
fleshed-out description of the concept is to be found in Lord Goff of Chieveley’s
famous speech in the <i>Spiliada</i> case, summarised much more recently by
Lord Collins in the <i>Altimo </i>case at para 88 as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The task of the court is to
identify the forum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of
all the parties and for the ends of justice; …”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That concept generally requires a summary examination of
connecting factors between the case and one or more jurisdictions in which it
could be litigated. Those include matters of practical convenience such as
accessibility to courts for parties and witnesses and the availability of a
common language so as to minimise the expense and potential for distortion involved
in translation of evidence. Although they are important, they are not
necessarily conclusive. Connecting factors also include matters such as the
system of law which will be applied to decide the issues, the place where the
wrongful act or omission occurred and the place where the harm occurred.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus far, the search for these connecting factors gives rise to no
difficult issues of principle, even though they may not all point in the same
direction. The problems thrown up by this appeal all arise from the combination
of two factors. The first is that the “case” involves multiple defendants
domiciled in different jurisdictions. The second is that, following <i>Owusu v
Jackson</i>, the court is disabled from the exercise of its traditional common
law power to stay the proceedings against the domiciled anchor defendant by
reason of article 4: see paras 23 to 41 above.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There can be no doubt that, when Lord Goff originally formulated the
concept quoted above, he would have regarded the phrase “in which <i>the case </i>can
be suitably tried for the interest of all the parties” as referring to the case
as a whole, and therefore as including the anchor defendant among the parties.
Although the persuasive burden was reversed, as between permission to serve out
against the foreign defendant and the stay of proceedings against the anchor
defendant, the court was addressing a single piece of multi-defendant
litigation and seeking to decide where it should, as a whole, be tried. The
concept behind the phrases “the forum” and “the proper place” is that the court
is looking for a single jurisdiction in which the claims against all the
defendants may most suitably be tried. The <i>Altimo</i> case also involved
multiple defendants. Although it was decided after <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>, it
concerned the international jurisdiction of the courts of the Isle of Man, so
that the particular problems thrown up by this appeal did not arise.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An unspoken assumption behind that formulation of the concept of forum
conveniens or proper place, may have been (prior to <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>)
that a jurisdiction in which the claim simply could not be tried against some
of the multiple defendants could not qualify as the proper place, because the
consequence of trial there against only some of the defendants would risk
multiplicity of proceedings about the same issues, and inconsistent judgments.
But the cases in which this risk has been expressly addressed tend to show that
it is only one factor, albeit a very important factor indeed, in the evaluative
task of identifying the proper place. For example, in <i>Société Commerciale de
Réassurance v Eras International Ltd (The Eras Eil Actions)</i> [1992] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 570, Mustill LJ said this, at p 591:</a></p><a name="para69">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… in practice the factors which
make the party served a necessary or proper party … will also weigh heavily in
favour of granting leave to make the foreigner a party, although they will not
be conclusive.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cases where the court has found that, in practice, the claimants will
in any event continue against the anchor defendant in England, the avoidance of
irreconcilable judgments has frequently been found to be decisive in favour of
England as the proper place, even in cases where all the other connecting
factors appeared to favour a foreign jurisdiction: see eg <i>OJSC VTB Bank v Parline
Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2013/3538.html">[2013] EWHC 3538 (Comm)</a>, per Leggatt J at para 16.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71">71. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That is a fair description of the judge’s reasoning in the present case.
Having found that, looking at the matter as between the claimants and KCM, all
the connecting factors pointed towards Zambia, the judge concluded that,
factoring in the closely related claim against Vedanta, which he found as a
matter of fact that the claimants were likely to pursue in England in any
event, the risk of irreconcilable judgments arising from separate proceedings
in different jurisdictions against each defendant was decisive in identifying
England as the proper place: see paras 160 to 168. He said that:</a></p><a name="para71">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The alternative - two trials on
opposite sides of the world on precisely the same facts and events - is
unthinkable.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is obvious from his analysis (assuming that substantial justice could
be obtained in Zambia) that, had the English court retained its jurisdiction to
stay the proceedings as against Vedanta, as it was thought it did prior to <i>Owusu
v Jackson</i>, the judge would have done so, and thereby ensured that the case
was brought to trial against both defendants in Zambia.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants submitted that the judge’s approach took insufficient
account of the fact that the language of CPR 6.37(3) requires the court to be
satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring “the
claim”, rather than the proper place for trial of the case as a whole. By “the
claim” it was submitted that the rule meant only the claim against the foreign
defendant. It is evident that, if the judge had confined himself to that
analysis, he would have set aside service against KCM, subject to the
substantial justice issue. The appellants contrasted the wording of the
predecessor rule, RSC Order 11 rule 4(2) which provided that:</a></p><a name="para73">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“No such permission shall be
granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the court that <i>the
case</i> is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Order.”
(my emphasis)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have not been persuaded that this change of language from “the case”
to “the claim” was intended to effect any change in the previously clearly
stated requirement for the court to consider the proper place for the case as a
whole. In particular, the phrase “the claim” is used in CPR Practice Direction 6B
paragraph 3.1(3) in a way which suggests that the foreign defendant must be “a
necessary or proper party to<i> that claim</i>”, which is the claim which has
been or will be served on the anchor defendant.</a></p><a name="para74">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have however been much more troubled by the absence of any particular
focus by the judge upon the fact that, in this case, the anchor defendant,
Vedanta, had by the time of the hearing offered to submit to the jurisdiction
of the Zambian courts, so that the whole case could be tried there. This did
not, of course, prevent the claimants from continuing against Vedanta in
England, nor could it give rise to any basis for displacing article 4 as
conferring a right to do so upon the claimants. But it does lead to this
consequence, namely that the reason why the parallel pursuit of a claim in
England against Vedanta and in Zambia against KCM would give rise to a risk of
irreconcilable judgments is because the claimants have chosen to exercise that
right to continue against Vedanta in England, rather than because Zambia is not
an available forum for the pursuit of the claim against both defendants. In
this case it is the claimants rather than the defendants who claim that the
risk of irreconcilable judgments would be prejudicial to them. Why (it may be
asked) should that risk be a decisive factor in the identification of the
proper place, when it is a factor which the claimants, having a choice, have
brought upon themselves?</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although this is not a question which the judge addressed in terms, he
plainly regarded the <i>OJSC VTB Bank</i> case as in substance
indistinguishable from this case, and there is to be found an analysis of that
very question by Leggatt J, at paras 8 to 10:</a></p><a name="para76">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two other arguments
on which Mr Moverley Smith places greater weight are, first, an argument that
it is a matter of choice on the claimant’s part to bring the proceedings
against the first and third defendants here. Those defendants, he says, could
equally well have been sued in Russia. There is no evidence before the court
that that is the case, but I am prepared to assume for the purposes of argument
today that it is the case, and in any event Mr Moverley Smith has confirmed,
albeit only in the course of his oral submissions, that if necessary the first
and third defendants will give undertakings to submit to the jurisdiction of
the Russian courts.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument,
therefore, is, in substance, that although the claimant has chosen to sue the
first and third defendants in this country, it has an alternative forum
available, a forum which is much more convenient when one considers all the
connecting factors, and that if the claimant chooses still to pursue claims
against the first and third defendants in England even if unsuccessful in
joining the second defendant to those claims so that the second defendant can
only be pursued in Russia, then that is a choice which it has made, and the
fact that it is a matter of choice negates, or substantially diminishes, the
weight that would otherwise be given to the importance and desirability of
avoiding duplication of proceedings and the risk of inconsistent judgments.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the force of that
point but it does not seem to me to answer the fact that it is a matter of
entitlement on the claimant’s part to sue the first and third defendants in
England. There is no reason why the claimant should be expected or required to
relinquish that right in order to avoid duplication of proceedings. Rather, it
seems to me that the existence of that right and the fact that it is being exercised
is the starting point and the background against which I ought to consider the
question of whether England is also the appropriate forum for the claim against
the second defendant.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Coulson J was, in the present case, no doubt aware that Vedanta had made
the same offer as had been made by the anchor defendant before Leggatt J to
submit to the jurisdiction of the relevant foreign court, but the question is
whether Leggatt J’s analysis is or is not right in principle. If it is, then I
consider that the judge’s analysis of the proper place question in the present
case cannot be faulted. But if it is not, then there is a need to consider
whether the force of the risk of irreconcilable judgments ought to be either
eliminated or at least reduced in the balancing of all relevant factors, below
a level which the judge regarded as decisive.</a></p><a name="para77">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Gibson submitted that, if Leggatt J’s analysis is right, then the
risk of irreconcilable judgments is likely to be decisive in every case where
the claimants have a right to sue the anchor defendant in England under article
4, regardless of the strength of the other connecting factors with the foreign
jurisdiction. It would, he said, be hard to imagine stronger connecting factors
than those in either the <i>OJSC VTB Bank</i> case or in this case, and I am
inclined to agree with him. The result would be, as outlined in paras 38 to 40
above, that the English court would not merely have one hand tied behind its
back because of its inability to stay the proceedings against the anchor
defendant, but the other hand paralysed by the almost inevitable priority to be
given to the risk of irreconcilable judgments, where claimants chose to
exercise their right to continue against the anchor defendant in England.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that Leggatt
J’s analysis of this point, followed by the judge, is wrong. At the heart of it
lies the proposition that, because a claimant has a right to sue the anchor
defendant in England, there is “no reason why the claimant should be expected
or required to relinquish that right in order to avoid duplication of
proceedings”. In my judgment, there is good reason why the claimants in the
present case should have to make that choice, always assuming that substantial
justice is available in Zambia (which is a necessary but hypothetical predicate
for the whole of the analysis of this issue).</a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in article 4 which can be interpreted as being intended
to confer upon claimants a right to bring proceedings against an EU domiciliary
in the member state of its domicile in such a way that avoids incurring the
risk of irreconcilable judgments. On the contrary, article 4 is, as was
emphasised in <i>Owusu v Jackson,</i> blind to considerations of that kind. The
mitigation of that risk is available in a purely intra-EU context under article
8.1 (where that risk is expressly recognised). But it is unavailable where the
related defendant is (as here) domiciled outside any of the member states.</a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Looking at the matter from an intra-member states perspective, a person
wishing to bring related claims against a number of defendants which, if
litigated separately, would give rise to a risk of irreconcilable judgments,
has a choice. The claimant may bring separate proceedings against each related
defendant in the member state of that defendant’s domicile, thereby incurring a
risk of irreconcilable judgments. Or the claimant may bring a single set of
proceedings against all the defendants in the member state of the domicile of
only one of them, so as to avoid that risk. That choice is what article 8.1
expressly permits.</a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81"></a><a name="para82">82. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the risk of irreconcilable judgments is one which, as in the present
case, exists to the prejudice only of the claimants, I can see no possible
reason why a right to sue in England under article 4 should not give rise to
the same choice, where the alternative jurisdiction lies outside that of the member
states, in a place where the claimant may sue all the defendants, not because
of article 8.1, but because they are all prepared to submit to that
jurisdiction. The alternative view (as expressed by Leggatt J) that the right
conferred by article 4 should not expose the claimants to the need to make such
a choice would appear to convert the right conferred by article 4 to an
altogether higher level of priority, where the alternative forum lies outside
that of the member states, than it does where the alternative forum lies
inside, under article 8. In short, if the article 4 right is not a trump card
for the purpose of avoiding irreconcilable judgments within the confines of the
member states, why should it become a trump card outside those confines?</a></p><a name="para82">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The recognition that claimants seeking to avail themselves of their article
4 rights to sue an anchor defendant are nonetheless exposed to a choice whether
to do so at the risk of irreconcilable judgments, even in cases where article 8
is not available, but another proper, convenient or natural forum is available
for the pursuit of the case against all the defendants is, to my mind, the
answer to the conundrum posed in para 40 above. It does not in any way bring
into play forum conveniens considerations as a reason for denying the claimants
access to the jurisdiction of England as a member state, against the anchor
defendant. It simply exposes the claimants to the same choice, whether or not
to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, as is presented by the
combination of article 4 and article 8 in an intra-EU context.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That analysis does not mean, when the court comes to apply its national
rules of private international law to the question whether to permit service
out of the jurisdiction upon KCM, that the risk of irreconcilable judgments is
thereby altogether removed as a relevant factor. But it does in my view mean
that it ceases to be a trump card, and that the basis upon which the judge,
following Leggatt J in the <i>OJSC VTB Bank</i> case, regarded it as decisive,
involved an error of principle. Since the Court of Appeal appears to have
adopted the same approach as the judge on this issue, I would regard it as
incumbent upon this court to carry out that balancing of connecting factors and
risk of irreconcilable judgments afresh. Like the judge, it seems to me
sensible first to do so without regard to any risk that the claimants would not
obtain substantial justice if required to proceed, at least against KCM, in
Zambia.</a></p><a name="para84">

</span>It is unnecessary to do more than barely summarise the connecting
factors with Zambia which led the judge to the conclusion that, putting aside
the risk of irreconcilable judgments, Zambia was overwhelmingly the proper
place for the claim to be tried. He described those factors as relevant to a
trial as between the claimants and KCM, but the only factor to the contrary
which he identified for the purposes of a notional trial as between the
claimants and Vedanta was the risk of irreconcilable judgments. In fact, almost
all the connecting factors with Zambia identified by the judge are equally
applicable to the case as a whole (ie as against KCM and Vedanta). In summary:</a></p><a name="para85">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The allegedly wrongful acts or omissions occurred primarily in Zambia.
This is plainly true of the claim against KCM, but since the liability of
Vedanta depends mainly upon the extent to which it intervened in the operation
of the Mine, it is likely to be true of Vedanta as well.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The causative link between the allegedly negligent operation of the Mine
and the damage which ensued is of course the escape of noxious substances into
waterways, which also occurred within Zambia.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Mine was operated (whether by KCM alone, or by KCM and Vedanta
together, as the claimants allege) pursuant to a Zambian mining licence and
subject to Zambian legislation. In any event, it is common ground that all the
applicable law is Zambian, even if that country may prove to follow the common
law of England and Wales in material respects.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimants are all poor persons who would have real difficulty
travelling to England to give evidence, for example of their injuries, or of
the damage to their land and livelihoods. Although English is an official
language in Zambia, many of the claimants only speak a local dialect which would
require translation in order to be understood by an English judge or advocate,
but not by their Zambian equivalents.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>KCM’s witnesses of fact are all based in Zambia. They far outnumber the
potential witnesses employed by Vedanta, some (but by no means all) of whom may
be supposed to be domiciled in England.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">vi)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although relevant disclosable documents will be likely to be found in
England and in Zambia (in the possession or control of Vedanta and KCM
respectively), many of KCM’s documents would, like the evidence of their
witnesses, require translation for use in an English court, but not in a
Zambian court, which has the considerable advantage in this context of being
effectively bilingual.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">vii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All the regulatory and testing records and reports relevant to the alleged
emissions from the Mine are likely to be based in Zambia, as is the responsible
regulator.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">viii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against all those factors it may, as already noted, be the case that
significant relevant documents are located in England. In an age when documents
may be scanned (if not already in electronic form) and then transmitted easily
and cheaply round the world, this does not seem to me to be a powerful factor.
Some of the relevant conduct which the claimants may allege against Vedanta or
upon which Vedanta may wish to rely by way of defence, may well have occurred
in England, for example at board meetings of Vedanta. But its relatively small
number of employees are likely to find it much easier to travel to Zambia than
their counterparts in KCM, let alone the claimants themselves, would find it
for the purposes of travel to England, if only because of the enormous
disparity in the number who would be required to travel in each case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ix)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A judgment of the Zambian court would be recognisable and enforceable in
England, against Vedanta. Zambian judgments are enforceable in England under
Part II of the Administration of Justice Act 1920. Zambia is specifically
listed as a relevant Commonwealth jurisdiction for the purposes of the 1920 Act
by the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (Administration of Justice Act 1920,
Part II) (Consolidation) Order (SI 1984/129).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would not ignore, or downplay, the mitigation of those factors which
good case management of an English claim might be able to achieve. For example,
as has happened in the past, the English judge may arrange for sittings in
Zambia, for Zambian evidence to be taken by video conference, and for a Zambian
court room or building to be continuously available to the claimants and the
Zambian public to listen to and to view on screen those parts of the trial
being conducted in England. As already noted, even if the volume of documents
located in Zambia greatly exceeds those located in England (as is likely),
modern facilities for their transmission should, to a considerable extent,
reduce the inconvenience which might otherwise arise from their current
location.</a></p><a name="para86">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In conclusion, it is sensible to stand back and look at the matter in
the round. This case seeks compensation for a large number of extremely poor
Zambian residents for negligence or breach of Zambian statutory duty in
connection with the escape within Zambia of noxious substances arising in
connection with the operation of a Zambian mine. If substantial justice was
available to the parties in Zambia as it is in England, it would offend the
common sense of all reasonable observers to think that the proper place for
this litigation to be conducted was England, if the risk of irreconcilable
judgments arose purely from the claimants’ choice to proceed against one of the
defendants in England rather than, as is available to them, against both of
them in Zambia. For those reasons I would have concluded that the claimants had
failed to demonstrate that England is the proper place for the trial of their
claims against these defendants, having regard to the interests of the parties
and the ends of justice.</a></p><a name="para87">

<p class="ParaHeading">Substantial justice</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if the court concludes (as I would have in the present case) that a
foreign jurisdiction is the proper place in which the case should be tried, the
court may nonetheless permit (or refuse to set aside) service of English
proceedings on the foreign defendant if satisfied, by cogent evidence, that
there is a real risk that substantial justice will not be obtainable in that
foreign jurisdiction. The same test was, prior to <i>Owusu v Jackson</i>,
applicable in the context of an application for a stay of English proceedings
against a defendant served within the jurisdiction. The question whether there
is a real risk that substantial justice will be unobtainable is generally
treated as separate and distinct from the balancing of the connecting factors
which lies at the heart of the issue as to proper place, but that is more
because it calls for a separate and careful analysis of distinctly different
evidence than because it is an inherently different question. If there is a
real risk of the denial of substantial justice in a particular jurisdiction,
then it seems to me obvious that it is unlikely to be a forum in which the case
can be tried most suitably for the interests of the parties and the ends of
justice.</a></p><a name="para88">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"></a><a name="para89">89. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the judge described this as an “access to justice”
issue. By this he meant that the real risk (in his view a probability) that
substantial justice would be unavailable in Zambia had nothing to do with any
lack of independence or competence in its judiciary or any lack of a fair civil
procedure suitable for handling large group claims. Rather, it derived
essentially from two factors: first, the practicable impossibility of funding
such group claims where the claimants were all in extreme poverty; and
secondly, the absence within Zambia of sufficiently substantial and suitably
experienced legal teams to enable litigation of this size and complexity to be
prosecuted effectively, in particular against a defendant (KCM) with a track
record which suggested that it would prove an obdurate opponent. The judge
acknowledged that in the large amount of evidence and lengthy argument
presented on this issue there was material going both ways, giving rise to
factual issues some of which he had to resolve, but others of which he could
not resolve without a full trial. Nonetheless he concluded not merely that
there was a real risk but a probability that the claimants would not obtain
access to justice so that, in his view, and notwithstanding the need for
caution and cogent evidence, this reason for preferring the English to the
Zambian jurisdiction was established by a substantial margin beyond the real
risk which the law requires. There is no satisfactory substitute for a full
reading of the judge’s careful analysis of this issue, to which he gave his
full and detailed attention notwithstanding the fact that he had already
concluded, without regard to the access to justice issue, that he should refuse
the defendants’ applications upon the basis that England was the proper place
for the trial of the case. I will confine myself to a bare summary of his
reasoning, sufficient to make sense of the analysis which follows.</a></p><a name="para89">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge found that the claimants were at the poorer end of the poverty
scale in one of the poorest countries of the world, that they had no sufficient
resources of their own (even as a large group) with which to fund the
litigation themselves, that they would not obtain legal aid for this claim and
nor could it be funded by a Conditional Fee Agreement (“CFA”) because CFAs are
unlawful in Zambia.</a></p><a name="para90">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless he acknowledged that there was some evidence that lawyers
would be prepared to pursue such claims on the basis of the up-front payment of
a modest deposit to fund disbursements, but otherwise on the basis that the
lawyers would recover payment for their work from costs ordered to be paid
(without a success fee) from the defendants, if the claim succeeded. He
acknowledged also that the evidence did not demonstrate that no lawyers would
be prepared to offer to undertake the litigation on that basis, but rather that
those who might offer would simply lack the resources, in terms of numbers in
the legal team, or experience, with which to be able to conduct complex
litigation of this kind with the requisite degree of competence and efficiency.
Finally, he acknowledged that there was some evidence of group environmental
litigation of a similar kind being conducted before the Zambian courts, but he
considered, upon the basis of detailed evidence about those cases that they
supported, rather than detracted from, a view that the Zambian legal profession
lacked the resources and experience with which to conduct such litigation
successfully.</a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As the Court of Appeal observed when affirming the judge’s decision on
this issue, the appellants face formidable difficulties in asking any appellate
court to overturn this detailed fact-finding exercise, by an experienced judge
who stated in terms (and there is no reason to doubt) that he had read all the
relevant materials and carefully considered the detailed opposing arguments.
Nonetheless, and supported by a written intervention by the Attorney General of
Zambia, the appellants mounted a full-frontal attack on the judge’s conclusions
which, they submitted, this court ought to entertain because of flaws in the
judge’s application of the relevant law. In outline, these were as follows:</a></p><a name="para92">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge failed to heed judicial warnings that funding issues will only
in exceptional cases justify a finding of lack of substantial justice.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge failed to acknowledge that <i>substantial</i> justice required
the claimants to take their forum as they found it.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge failed to pay due regard to considerations of comity, and a
requirement for cogent evidence.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">I will take those in turn.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are indeed judicial warnings of undoubted authority that the
English court should not in this context conclude, otherwise than in
exceptional cases, that the absence of a means of funding litigation in the
foreign jurisdiction, where such means are available in England, will lead to a
real risk of the non-availability of substantial justice: see <i>Connelly v RTZ
Corpn plc (No 2)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/30.html">[1998] AC 854</a>, 873 per Lord Goff and <i>Lubbe v</i> <i>Cape
plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/41.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1545</a>, 1555 per Lord Bingham of Cornhill. They were in fact
both cases in which that hurdle of exceptionality was surmounted, in the first
in relation to exposure to radiation at a uranium mine in Namibia and the
second in relation to exposure to asbestos from mining and processing in South
Africa. The judge plainly had those considerations well in mind, since he
regarded the <i>Lubbe</i> case as one of three authorities which set out the
relevant law, and Lord Goff’s dicta in the <i>Connelly</i> case are quoted in
full by Lord Bingham in the <i>Lubbe</i> case. Of course, a judge may cite all
the relevant authorities and yet still misapply the law, but in this case the
judge came nowhere near treating the absence of particular forms of litigation
funding in Zambia, such as legal aid and CFAs, as conclusive. He conducted a
searching analysis of all possible forms of funding, and found that most were
unavailable but that the one which was in principle available would not attract
a legal team which was both prepared to act, and able to do so with the requisite
resources and experience. Although the judge did not refer to it expressly, the
evidence included the possibility of funding cases of this kind, or the
necessary underlying research, by contribution from locally based NGOs, but the
absence of reference to a matter of detail in a judgment about an issue which
the judge only dealt with for completeness comes nowhere near to demonstrating
that he left this evidence out of account.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94">94. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The gist of the appellants’ second point is that the judge’s denigration
of the accessibility of substantial justice in Zambia was too heavily based
upon a comparison between the relatively rudimentary way in which a case of
this kind could be litigated in Zambia, and its likely elaborate treatment by
well-resourced legal teams (in particular on the claimants’ side) in England.
The judge plainly regarded this litigation as both complex and weighty. As an
experienced judge of the Technology and Construction Court his assessment
deserves respect. It is also in my view objectively justified. In the absence
of any admissions from the appellants which might serve to narrow the issues
(and there are none), large aspects of the claimants’ collective and individual
claims will depend upon the presentation of expert evidence. They will include
identifying the emissions which actually occurred, and their toxicity,
establishing whether the system of operation of the Mine (both in its planning
and implementation) fell short of that requisite to satisfy a duty of care,
tracing the emissions through to watercourses in the vicinity of the claimants,
proving (during a considerable period of time) that these emissions caused
damage to particular claimants’ land, business and health, and quantifying
(save perhaps in relation to personal injuries) the diminution in the value of
business and property thereby caused. Much of that expert work will, from the
perspective of the claimants’ legal team, have to be paid for as disbursements,
but it will still need to be supervised by competent and experienced lawyers.
As is evident from the decision of the Supreme Court of Zambia in <i>Nyasulu v
Konkola Copper Mines plc</i> </a><a href="https://zambialii.org/zm/judgment/supreme-court-zambia/2015/33">[2015] ZMSC 33</a>, it will be necessary for each
individual claimant to prove both causation and loss, and to value their loss
unless (which did not happen in that case and has not been volunteered here)
KCM were to agree that issues of that kind could be determined either on the
basis of typical claimants or by means of an out of court claims management
process.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95">95. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is of course possible, indeed likely, that the litigation of all
those issues in Zambia would, even if funding and the necessary legal resources
were available, be undertaken on a simpler and more economical scale than would
be likely if undertaken in the Technology and Construction Court by large,
sophisticated legal teams, without necessarily depriving the claimants of
substantial justice. But the judge did not address this question by way of a
comparison between litigation in England and in Zambia. His enquiry was
directed to the question whether the unavoidable scale and complexity of this
case (wherever litigated) could be undertaken at all with the limited funding
and legal resources which the evidence led him to conclude were available
within Zambia. His judgment does not therefore disclose the misdirection about
the meaning of “substantial justice” which is suggested by the appellants.</a></p><a name="para95">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the judge’s analysis positively demonstrates that he had due
regard to considerations of comity and the requirement for cogent evidence. He
referred to the need for cogent evidence in express terms, at para 174. He
identified the evidence which he found persuasive and quoted from some of it.
Cogent evidence does not mean unchallenged evidence.</a></p><a name="para96">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para96"></a><a name="para97">97. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also evident that the judge was conscious of the need to exercise
restraint on grounds of comity. At para 198 he said this:</a></p><a name="para97">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I am conscious that some of the
foregoing paragraphs could be seen as a criticism of the Zambian legal system.
I might even be accused of colonial condescension. But that is not the
intention or purpose of this part of the judgment. I am not being asked to
review the Zambian legal system. I simply have to reach a conclusion on a
specific issue, based on the evidence before me. And it seems to me that, doing
my best to assess that evidence, I am bound to conclude … that the claimants
would almost certainly not get access to justice if these claims were pursued
in Zambia.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97"></a><a name="para98">98. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My conclusion that the judge did not misdirect himself in law in any of
the respects contended for by the appellants is sufficient to dispose of this
issue since, otherwise, the appellants’ case in relation to it is no more or
less than a challenge to judicial fact-finding. But for completeness I will say
something about what appeared to be the strongest point in the appellants’
challenge. This was that the judge failed to have sufficient regard to the
evidence constituted by a series of Zambian cases, comparable in differing
extents to this case, in which groups of claimants had managed to litigate
issues about pollution and environmental damage all the way to a fair trial and
even to a success on liability in the <i>Nyasulu</i> case referred to above.
The judge studied each of those cases (of which the <i>Nyasulu</i> case is the
most relevant) in some detail and was presented with significant evidence about
the underlying reasons why, save for 12 claimants out of 2,000 in that case,
the claimants were almost routinely unsuccessful. There was one case against
KCM which settled, but there was an issue, which the judge could not decide, as
to whether many of the claimants received their share of the settlement sum.</a></p><a name="para98">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para98"></a><a name="para99">99. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a sufficient example of the lack of foundation for this factual
challenge on appeal to look at the appellants’ best two examples. In the <i>Nyasulu</i>
case, 2,000 claimants joined in group litigation about a discharge from the
Mine in 2006 into the Mushishima stream and thereby into the Kafue river.
Medical reports evidencing personal injuries were put in evidence only in
relation to 12 claimants. The trial judge found in favour of the claimants on
liability, and was content to award general damages to all 2,000 claimants on
the base of medical evidence about only 12 of them. In the Supreme Court
([2015] ZMSC 33) the judge was upheld on liability but the claim by the
remaining 1,989 claimants was dismissed for want of medical evidence to prove
that they had suffered any loss. At first sight this might appear to have been
a disaster attributable to a difference of view between the first instance and
appellate judges, but Coulson J was provided with evidence about how the case
had been prepared, both from one of the claimants and from the lawyer who
conducted the claimants’ defence of KCM’s appeal in the Supreme Court. The
judge was entitled to conclude from that evidence that the reason why so few of
the claimants had medical evidence deployed on their behalf was that this would
have required funding from the claimants which they could not afford, for
disbursements which the lawyers instructed would not have been able to pay for out
of their own resources.</a></p><a name="para99">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99"></a><a name="para100">100. <span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Shamilimo v Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia Ltd </i>(2007/HP/0725), a
case about radiation emissions, there was evidence which entitled Coulson J to
find, as he did, that this claim failed on causation because the claimants
could not fund the necessary expert evidence to prove it. In conclusion
therefore, there was in relation to both those cases evidence from which the
judge was entitled to conclude that they supported rather than detracted from
his overall finding that funding and local legal resources were insufficient to
enable the claimants to obtain substantial justice in Zambia. It is irrelevant
whether an appellate court might, upon a review of the same evidence, reach a
different conclusion, even with the assistance from the Attorney General of
Zambia, for which the court is grateful.</a></p><a name="para100">

</span>Having rejected the appellants’ case on abuse of EU law and real triable
issue, but having upheld their case on proper place, I would, but for their
failure on the issue as to substantial justice, have been minded to allow their
appeal. As it is however I consider that this appeal should be dismissed, on
the substantial justice issue.</a></p><a name="para102">
