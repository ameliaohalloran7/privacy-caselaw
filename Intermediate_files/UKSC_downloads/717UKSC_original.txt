The issue arises in a specific set of circumstances.</span></a></p><a name="para1"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">The general terms and conditions governing the supply contract between the supplier and the trader provided that the trader should pay the commercial price for the supply plus such amount of VAT (if any) as was chargeable in respect of the supply. As determined by a subsequent judgment of the Court of Justice, the supply should in fact have been treated as standard rated for VAT, so that the trader should have been charged VAT assessed at the relevant percentage of the commercial price for the supply. However, at the time of the supply both the supplier and the trader, acting in good faith and on the basis of a common mistake, understood that the supply was exempt from VAT, so the trader was only charged and only paid a sum equal to the commercial price for the supply. The invoices relating to the supplies in question denoted the supplies as exempt and hence indicated that no VAT was due in respect of them.</span></a></p><a name="para2"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">The tax authorities (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Commissioners, “HMRC”) made the same mistake in good faith. HMRC had inadvertently contributed to the mistake by the parties, by issuing tax guidance containing statements to the same effect.</span></a></p><a name="para3"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">The effect of the mistake has been that the trader has only paid the amounts equivalent to the commercial price for each supply and there is now no prospect that it can be made to pay, or will pay, the additional amount equivalent to the VAT element of the total price (ie the commercial price plus the VAT due in respect of it) which ought to have been charged and paid in respect of such supplies. Likewise, the supplier has not accounted to HMRC for any VAT due or paid in respect of such supplies, and there is no prospect that it can now be made to account, or will account, to HMRC for such VAT.</span></a></p><a name="para4"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">Notwithstanding this, the trader now maintains that under article 168(a) of the Principal VAT Directive (2006/112/EC - “the Directive”) it is entitled as against HMRC to make a claim to deduct as input VAT the VAT due in respect of the supplies in question or a VAT element deemed by law to be included in the price charged by the supplier for each supply (and hence deemed by law to be VAT in fact paid in respect of such supply when the trader paid what the parties believed to be the commercial price of the supply). Against this, HMRC contend that in the circumstances of this case, on the proper interpretation of the</span></a><a name="_Hlk31790034"> Directive</a>: (1) there is no VAT due or paid in respect of the supplies in question, so no claim can be made to recover input tax in relation to them, and/or (2) the invoices relating to the supplies in question did not show that VAT was due in respect of the supplies, and since the trader at no stage held invoices which showed that VAT was due and its amount, in compliance with article 226(9) and (10) of the Directive, for this reason also the trader is not entitled to recover input tax in relation to the supplies. The trader responds on point (1) that VAT must be treated as having been paid as part of the price (or as due) and on point (2) that all relevant facts are now known and it can prove by other means the amount of the VAT due or paid on each supply.</p>

The present proceedings are a test case in respect of supplies of services by Royal Mail where the same mistake was made. The court has been provided with estimates of between about £500m and £1 billion as the total value of the claims against HMRC.</span></a></p><a name="para6">

Article 132(1)(a) of the Directive (and equivalent provisions which preceded it) provides that member states shall exempt “the supply by the public postal services of services other than passenger transport and telecommunications services, and the supply of goods incidental thereto”. In implementing this provision, Parliament and HMRC interpreted it as covering all postal services supplied by Royal Mail. The implementing national legislation, the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“VATA”), contained a provision to this effect (Schedule 9, Group 3, paragraph 1) and HMRC issued guidance notes to the same effect.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

Accordingly, insofar as VAT was due in respect of the supply of the services, the total price payable by Zipvit for such supply under the contract was the commercial price plus the VAT element.</span></a></p><a name="para9">

It held that HMRC had no enforceable tax claim against Royal Mail because Royal Mail had not in its VAT returns declared any VAT in respect of its supply of the services, had made no voluntary disclosure of underpaid VAT, had not issued any invoice showing the VAT as due, and HMRC had not assessed Royal Mail as liable to pay any VAT: para 137. In those circumstances there was no VAT “due or paid” by Royal Mail in respect of the supply of the services, for the purposes of article 168(a) of the Directive: paras 138-146. The question whether HMRC would have been prevented by principles of public law, including the principle of legitimate expectation, from issuing an assessment against Royal Mail was left to one side, as unnecessary for determination: paras 147-148. In any event, since Zipvit did not hold valid tax invoices in respect of the supply of the services, showing a charge to VAT, it had no right to claim deduction of such VAT as input tax: paras 149-153. Although HMRC have a discretion under national law to accept alternative evidence of payment of VAT in place of a tax invoice (under regulation 29(2) of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2518) - “regulation 29(2)”), which they had omitted to consider in their decisions, the First-tier Tribunal found that on due consideration whether to accept alternative evidence, HMRC would inevitably and rightly have decided in the exercise of their discretion not to accept Zipvit’s claim for a deduction of input VAT in respect of the services: paras 192-198. The important point in that regard was that repayment of notional input VAT to Zipvit in respect of the services would constitute an unmerited windfall for Zipvit: paras 189 and 195-198. Zipvit had in fact paid only the commercial price for the services, exclusive of any element of VAT, so repayment to it of a notional element of VAT in respect of the supply of those services would mean that in economic terms it would have received the services for considerably less than their true commercial value, and there was no good reason why HMRC should in their discretion dedicate large sums of public money to achieve such an unmeritorious benefit for Zipvit.</span></a></p><a name="para21">

The Court of Appeal agreed with the Tribunals below on the question of the exercise of discretion by HMRC under regulation 29(2): paras 116-117. If HMRC treated Zipvit as having paid input VAT in respect of the services, Zipvit would receive an unmerited windfall (“uncovenanted bonus”), by obtaining in effect a reduction in the commercial price it had had to pay for the services, paid for out of public funds, even though that VAT had not been paid into the public purse: para 116.

The sum charged by Royal Mail and paid by Zipvit should be treated as a total price comprising a (lesser) taxable amount and the VAT at standard rate on that taxable amount. Thus, if Royal Mail charged Zipvit £120 in an invoice for the services, that being the commercial price for the services, and Zipvit only paid that amount, then even though the invoice purported to say that the services were exempt from VAT, the&nbsp; taxable amount (within the meaning of articles 73 and 78 of the Directive) should (after the elapse of six months under article 90 and section 26A of VATA) be treated as having been only £100 and the additional £20 (assuming a 20% rate of VAT) should be treated as VAT, which Zipvit is now entitled to claim as input VAT relating to supplies made by it to its customers.

Usually, in the absence of a declaration by the supplier or the presentation of tax invoices which comply with article 226(9) and (10), the tax authority will not know what supplies have been made and whether it is in a position to issue a tax assessment against the supplier. Further and in any event, there is nothing in the conduct of HMRC which could justify disregarding the principles of EU law referred to in this jurisprudence. As in the <i>Volkswagen </i>and <i>Biosafe-Indústria</i> cases, the situation under review has arisen as a result of a simple mistake made in good faith by all of Zipvit, Royal Mail and HMRC.</a></p><a name="para34">

In that regard, HMRC refer in particular to the <i>MDDP</i> case. They contend that in substance Zipvit is seeking both to take advantage of the fact that national law mistakenly treated the supply of the services in this case as exempt and to rely on the Directive in support of its claim to deduct input VAT in relation to such supply, in breach of that principle. Zipvit denies this.</a></p><a name="para35">

The approach is strict in relation to the substantive requirements, but departure from the formal requirements is permissible if alternative satisfactory evidence of the VAT which was paid or is due can be produced by the trader.

HMRC could not, in the exercise of their discretion under regulation 29(2), refuse to accept the alternative evidence produced by Zipvit in support of its claim.</a></p><a name="para37">

According to Zipvit, the better explanation of the reasoning in those cases is that they were concerned to ensure that a trader should not be prevented from being able to give practical effect to its right to claim deduction of input VAT in circumstances where it had been misled by receipt of an invoice which purported to show that no VAT was due in respect of a supply.</a></p><a name="para38">

Under the VAT regime, several parties need to know these matters in order for the regime to function effectively; and the tax authorities need to be presented with invoices which deal properly with these requirements so that they can monitor the position and ensure that the supplier has properly accounted to them for the VAT charged. Therefore, according to HMRC, a valid claim for deduction of input tax cannot be made in the absence of a VAT invoice which satisfies these particular requirements.</span></a></p><a name="para39">

They also rely, in particular, on the Advocate Generals’ opinions and the judgments in the <i>Volkswagen</i> and </span><i>Biosafe-Indústria</i> cases, which they contend support their submission that a valid claim for deduction of input VAT in respect of the supply of the services would have to be supported by a VAT invoice from Royal Mail which complied with article 226(9) and (10) of the Directive. Zipvit had never asked Royal Mail to send invoices charging it with the VAT due in respect of the commercial price charged for the supply of the services and evidently had no intention of asking for such invoices or of paying the charge for VAT which they would contain. Since Zipvit could not produce relevant VAT invoices in support of its claim to deduct input VAT in respect of the services, that claim must fail. There is nothing in EU law which can be relied on to impugn the conclusion of the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal regarding the exercise of HMRC’s discretion under regulation 29(2).</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is it relevant that the trader knew at the same time as the tax authority and the supplier that the supply was not in fact exempt, or had the same means of knowledge as them, and could have offered to pay the VAT which was due in respect of the supply (as calculated by reference to the commercial price of the supply) so that it could be passed on to the tax authority, but omitted to do so?</p> </a></div><a name="para42">
