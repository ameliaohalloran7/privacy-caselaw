<p class="NewSpeech">LORD CARNWATH: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom Lord
Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal concerns the rights of so-called “<i>Zambrano </i>carers”
and their children to financial support from the state. That expression is
derived from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated 8
March 2011, in <i>Ruiz</i> <i>Zambrano v Office national de l’emploi</i> (Case
C-34/09) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C3409.html">[2012] QB 265</a>. The case concerned a Colombian who had been living in
Belgium with his wife, and working (and paying social security contributions),
but without a right to reside. Their three children, born between 2003 and
2005, acquired Belgian nationality at birth, and with it European citizenship
and the right of free movement, under article 20 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). When in 2005 he lost his job, he
was refused unemployment benefit, because under the relevant national law that
depended on his having a right to reside. The European court held that the
refusal of such a right was unlawful because it would result in the children
being deprived of effective enjoyment of their rights as European citizens.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present appeal arises from a challenge to the legality of amendment
regulations introduced in this country in November 2012 in response to the <i>Zambrano
</i>decision. They were designed to limit the rights of <i>Zambrano </i>carers
to claim certain categories of non-contributory social security assistance to
which those “habitually resident” would otherwise be entitled: more
specifically, income-related benefits, child benefit and child tax credit, and
housing and homelessness assistance. The amendment regulations in question are:</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Social Security (Habitual Residence) (Amendment) Regulations 2012
(SI 2012/2587), amending the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (SI
1987/1967).</p>

</span>The Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit (Miscellaneous Amendments)
Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/2612), amending the Child Benefit (General)
Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/223).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England)
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/2588), amending the Allocation of Housing
and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1294).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The effect of the amendment in each case is to add to the
relevant list of exclusions from qualifying rights of residence, a right to
reside existing by virtue of TFEU article 20, where that right “arises because
a British citizen would otherwise be deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the
substance of their rights as a European Union citizen”.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State’s evidence (in a statement by Gareth Cooper,
Policy Adviser) refers to the Explanatory Memorandum to the amendment regulations.
This explained the purpose as being to maintain the existing policy that
non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals are not entitled to claim
income-related benefits, following the ruling in the <i>Zambrano</i> case. Mr
Cooper (para 8) quotes it as follows:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the Home Office are amending
their regulations to provide a right to reside and a right to work to a non-EEA
national who is a primary carer of a dependent British citizen only if the
British citizen would otherwise be forced to leave the UK and be deprived of
exercising their rights as an EU citizen. If the social security regulations
are not amended such persons would become entitled to income related benefits.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The amendments had been subject to consultation with local
authority associations and the Social Security Advisory Committee, and had
attracted no objection or substantive comment. According to Mr Cooper it had
been estimated by the Home Office that there would initially be some 700 people
a year qualifying for <i>Zambrano </i>rights, giving rise to a potential annual
cost of between £3.8m and £9.4m in respect of income support, housing benefit
and council tax benefit together. Mr Cooper does not indicate what
consideration, if any, had been given to how children of workless <i>Zambrano </i>carers
were to be supported, if not entitled to such assistance.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts relevant to the present appellant, Mrs HC, can be shortly
stated. She is an Algerian national who has been living in this country since
2008, having arrived with leave but over-stayed. In 2010 she married a British
national on whom she was financially dependent. She has two children by him,
born in August 2011 and March 2013. Her relationship with him ended after
domestic violence in late 2012, when she sought help from the Oldham City
Council, in whose area she was then living. After an initial refusal, the
council agreed to provide temporary housing and financial support under section
17 of the Children Act 1989. Separate judicial review proceedings against the
council resulted in an interim order by His Honour Judge Pelling QC, under
which she and her children were accommodated by the council in two bedroom
accommodation and given £80.50 per week to cover subsistence and utility costs.
Those proceedings were later stayed by consent on the council’s agreement to
carry out a further assessment of their needs, and to continue the support in
the meantime.</a></p><a name="para4">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I start from the formulation of the principle by the European court in <i>Zambrano
</i>itself. Having described citizenship of the European Union as “the
fundamental status of nationals of the member state”, the court said:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those circumstances, article
20 TFEU … precludes national measures which have the effect of depriving
citizens of the European Union of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the
rights conferred by virtue of their status as citizens of the European Union …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A refusal to grant a
right of residence to a third country national with dependent minor children in
the member state where those children are nationals and reside, and also a
refusal to grant such a person a work permit, has such an effect.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be assumed that
such a refusal would lead to a situation where those children, citizens of the European
Union, <i>would have to leave the territory of the European Union</i> in order
to accompany their parents. Similarly, if a work permit were not granted to
such a person, he would risk not having sufficient resources to provide for
himself and his family, which would also result in the children, citizens of
the Union, <i>having to leave the territory of the European Union</i>. In those
circumstances, those citizens of the European Union would, as a result, be
unable to exercise the substance of the rights conferred on them by virtue of
their status as citizens of the Union.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the answer
to the questions referred is that article 20 TFEU … is to be interpreted as
meaning that it precludes a member state from refusing a third country national
on whom his minor children, who are European Union citizens, are dependent, a
right of residence in the member state of residence and nationality of those
children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that third country
national, in so far as such decisions deprive those children of the genuine
enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of European
Union citizen.” (emphasis added)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear (particularly from the passages highlighted in para 44) that
the reasoning of the court turned specifically and solely on the risk of being
obliged to leave the territory of the Union. There was no issue as to the
nature of financial support (if any) required, nor as to the extent of any
right to benefits otherwise available to nationals. Once the right of
residence, and with it the right to work, were established, the entitlement to
and the amount of unemployment benefit followed as a matter of Belgian law.
Indeed Advocate-General Sharpston had dismissed arguments that there might be
an “unreasonable burden” on public finances, pointing out that Mr Zambrano had
worked full-time for nearly five years, paid social security contributions, and
thus “contributed steadily and regularly to the public finances of the host
member state” (Opinion paras 118-120). Mr Drabble rightly does not suggest that
in itself the judgment throws any light on the right to non-contributory
benefits.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The same emphasis is found in the next significant case: <i>Dereci v
Bundesministerium für Inneres</i> (Case C-256/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C25611.html">[2012] 1 CMLR 45</a>. Mr Dereci,
a Turkish national, had entered Austria illegally. He had married an Austrian
woman and had three children who were EU citizens. He applied for a residence
permit, but this was refused by the national authorities because the EU
citizens concerned had not exercised their right of freedom of movement. The
European court accepted that, in the light of its decision in <i>Zambrano</i>,
the situation of Union citizens who have not made use of their freedom of
movement could not “for that reason alone, be assimilated to a purely internal
situation” (para 61). Having summarised the decision in that case, the court
said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“66.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that the
criterion relating to the denial of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of
the rights conferred by virtue of EU citizen status refers to situations in
which the Union citizen has, in fact, to leave not only the territory of the
member state of which he is a national but also the territory of the Union as a
whole.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That criterion is
specific in character inasmuch as it relates to situations in which, although
subordinate legislation on the right of residence of third country nationals is
not applicable, <i>a right of residence may not, exceptionally, be refused to a
third country national,</i> who is a family member of a member state national,
as the effectiveness of Union citizenship enjoyed by that national would
otherwise be undermined.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the mere
fact that it might appear desirable to a national of a member state, for
economic reasons or in order to keep his family together in the territory of
the Union, for the members of his family who do not have the nationality of a
member state to be able to reside with him in the territory of the Union, is
not sufficient in itself to support the view <i>that the Union citizen will be
forced to leave Union territory</i> if such a right is not granted.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That finding is,
admittedly, without prejudice to the question whether, on the basis of other
criteria, inter alia, by virtue of the right to the protection of family life,
a right of residence cannot be refused. However, that question must be tackled
in the framework of the provisions on the protection of fundamental rights
which are applicable in each case.”</p>

</span>That passage indicates both the “exceptional” nature of the <i>Zambrano </i>right
(para 67); and that it is triggered not by the mere desirability of keeping the
family together, on economic or other grounds, but solely by the threat of
being “forced to leave Union territory” if the right were not granted (para
68). Subsequent authorities are to the same effect. We have been referred to no
European court authority which extends <i>Zambrano </i>rights to include
non-contributory benefits of the kind in issue in the present appeal.</a></p><a name="para11">

-</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the common feature that,
although they are governed by legislation which falls, a priori, within the
competence of the member states, namely legislation on the right of entry and
residence of third-country nationals outside the scope of provisions of
secondary legislation which provide for the grant of such a right under certain
conditions, they nonetheless have an intrinsic connection with the freedom of
movement and residence of a Union citizen, which prevents the right of entry

</span>Mr Drabble asks us to note that the national (Spanish) court, in making
the reference, had referred to its possible relevance to social benefits under
domestic law (para 30). However, there is nothing in the European court’s
treatment of the case itself to suggest that the “scope of EU law” for these
purposes extended beyond protection against being obliged to leave. Thus it was
left for the national court to determine whether the refusal to grant residence
to the father would mean that he had to “leave the territory of the European
Union” with the result that “the children could be compelled to go with him,
and therefore to leave the territory of the European Union as a whole” (para
78).</a></p><a name="para13">

of his since the effectiveness of citizenship of the Union would otherwise be

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is convenient at this point to address Mr Drabble’s argument based on
a line of cases beginning with <i>Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home
Department</i> (Case C-413/99) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2002/C41399.html">[2002] ECR I-7091</a>, followed in <i>Ibrahim v

(Joined Cases C-310/08 and C-480/08) (both reported at <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2010/C48008.html">[2010] ICR 1118</a>). These
were concerned directly with a quite different issue: the interpretation of EU
Regulation 1612/68, on freedom of movement for workers. Article 12 provided
that children of a national of a member state employed in the territory of
another member state should be admitted to that state’s general educational
courses “under the same conditions as the nationals of that state, if such
children are residing in its territory”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Bambaust </i>itself there was an issue whether the children’s
rights of residence under the article continued after a change in the position
of the parents in the state concerned. It was held that the children retained
their right under article 12 to reside for the purpose of attending educational
courses, notwithstanding the facts that the parents had divorced, that the only
Union citizen parent had ceased to be a migrant worker in the state concerned,
and that the children were not themselves citizens of the Union (para 63). It
was held further that the parent who was the primary carer, irrespective of
nationality, must be permitted to reside with them in order to facilitate the
exercise of their right.</a></p><a name="para17">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Drabble relies in particular on the application of that principle in
the second case, <i>Ibrahim</i>. That concerned a Somali national who entered
with leave to join her Danish husband, who was at the time working here; their
children began to attend school shortly after her arrival. They later
separated, and the husband had ceased working here, and she was wholly
dependent on social assistance. The question arose whether she had a right of
residence derived from her children’s rights under article 12, or whether that
was subject to the conditions laid down in the Citizenship Directive (2004/38),
including that of “sufficient resources”. On a reference from the Court of
Appeal, the CJEU held that the rights of both children and their primary carers
were derived from article 12, and were not as such subject to any such
conditions (under the Citizenship Directive or otherwise) (paras 50-59).</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Drabble relies on this as showing that once the right of residence is
established it was not necessary to show a positive right to claim social
assistance. In the words of his case (para 4.34):</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The whole approach proceeds on
the basis that if there is a right of residence which arises even if the
individuals concerned are not self-sufficient, the individuals who are
exercising the rights derived from EU law will be able to claim the same
benefits as nationals of the host state.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">By the same token, he submits, in the absence of any
self-sufficiency condition or other limitation, the residence rights of <i>Zambrano

p 234:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The CJEU [in <i>Zambrano</i>] created
an EU citizenship-based right to reside, which necessarily triggers a right to
equal treatment under EU law. Nowhere did the CJEU suggest that those exercising
that right were not intended to really have that kind of right. Given that the <i>Zambrano</i>
case was a benefits case, it seems only fair to suppose that had the CJEU
wished to invent a new equal-treatment free right to reside, that is something
they might have mentioned.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para20">We have been here before, and
should have learnt from past experience. Following <i>Baumbast </i>UK
authorities were adamant that <i>Baumbast </i>only applied to the
self-sufficient (ie the well-off), even though the CJEU had not said so, and in
spite of the incongruity with the case law. According to the UK the right to
reside did not entail equal treatment. The Court of Appeal, while making the
reference in <i>Ibrahim </i>… </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/386.html">[2008] EWCA Civ 386</a> was inclined to agree,

</span>I have two difficulties with the comparison so made with this line of
cases. In the first place, the domestic law context was quite different. As the
court noted in <i>Ibrahim </i>(para 14), entitlement under the national
legislation turned on whether she had a right of residence conferred by EU law,
but was otherwise unlimited. The issue was whether it was implicitly subject to
a self-sufficiency condition derived from EU law. No such issue arises here.
The limitations are derived from the domestic legislation, and the only issue
is their compatibility with EU law. Secondly, the proposition that the right of
residence created in <i>Zambrano </i>“necessarily triggers” a right to equal
treatment under EU law begs one of the principal issues raised by the present
appeal - a question to which I now turn.</a></p><a name="para21">

principle of equal treatment that is part of EU law”, his submissions (rightly
in my view) are not based on any such general principle. They are directed
specifically to article 21 of the Charter, as applied by article 51, rather
than any more general principle. At an earlier oral permission hearing of this case
permission was refused for a separate ground of appeal based on article 18 of

can have no application to a third country national, such as Mrs HC. As Lady

</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1998/C8596.html">[1998] ECR I-2691</a>). Alternatively, in setting the support to be provided to <i>Zambrano
</i>carers, and in choosing between section 17 support and mainstream welfare
benefits, the Secretary of State was choosing between different modes of
implementing EU law, or (as Mr Banner puts it, for the AIRE Centre, as
intervener) regulating the entitlement to financial assistance under EU law.</p>

</span>Mr Coppel, for the Secretary of State, rejects that approach. It is not
enough to say that Mrs HC is personally (“<i>ratione personae</i>”) within the
scope of the Treaty by virtue of her derivative right of residence. <i>Sala </i>was
directed specifically to the rights of EU citizens (see judgment paras 62-63),
and was not in any event concerned with the application of the Charter. Nor is
it enough that the national law is related in some way to EU law. There must be
a direct link between the act in question and the implementation of that law.</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>This is illustrated by reference to <i>Ymeraga v Ministre du Travail, de
l’Emploi et de l’Immigration</i> (Case C-87/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C8712.html">[2013] 3 CMLR 33</a>. That
concerned the refusal by the Luxembourg government, under a national law on
freedom of movement, to grant a right of residence to family members of the
first applicant (Mr Y). One issue concerned the application of the Charter to
the law in question. The court considered whether the refusal was “a situation
involving the implementation of European Union law” within the meaning of
article 51. For that purpose -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it must be ascertained among
other things whether the national legislation at issue is intended to implement
a provision of EU law, what the character of that legislation is, and whether
it pursues objectives other than those covered by EU law, even if it is capable
of indirectly affecting that law, and also whether there are specific rules of EU
law on the matter or capable of affecting it …” (para 41)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The court accepted that the national law on freedom of
movement was “indeed intended to implement EU law”, but that was not enough.
The situation of the applicants was not governed by either of the EU directives
relied on, nor did the refusal of a right of residence to Mr Y’s family members
“have the effect of denying him the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the
rights conferred by virtue of his status as citizen of the Union”. Accordingly
the refusal did not involve the implementation of European Union law, and
accordingly the Charter had no application (paras 41-43).</p>

</span>Mr Coppel relies particularly on <i>Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig </i>(Case

about the level of non-contributory benefits, absent any specific requirement
or condition of EU law, are not within the scope of the Charter. In that case<i>
</i>a Romanian mother had been living in Germany with her son, where she was
looking for work. Her application for benefits as a job-seeker was refused
because national law excluded such benefits for foreign nationals whose right
of residence arose solely out of the search for employment. This was challenged
as breaching their right to equal treatment under Parliament and Council
Regulation No 883/2004 (which categorised such benefits as “special
non-contributory cash benefits”), article 4 of which provided that Union
citizens residing in another member state should enjoy the same benefits as
nationals of the host member state. It was held by the CJEU (in summary) that,
although the benefits in question fell within the scope of article 4, they were
linked to the right of residence under the Citizenship Directive and could be
limited by reference to its conditions.</p>

</span>A fourth question related to the application of certain provisions of
the Charter. The court referred to article 51, and to article 6(1) of the EU
Treaty, by which the provisions of the Charter are not to extend the
competences of the EU as defined in the Treaties (paras 87-88). It noted that
the relevant regulation did not lay down conditions for the rights in question;
it was therefore for the legislature of each state to lay down those conditions
(para 89). It concluded:</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, when the
member states lay down the conditions for the grant of special non-contributory
cash benefits and the extent of such benefits, they are not implementing EU
law.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view Mr Coppel’s approach is correct. The test is not whether Mrs
HC is personally within the scope of EU law in some way.<i> </i>The issue must
be judged by reference to the test set by article 51, which is directed to
“implementation” of EU law. Once it is determined that EU law does not require
more for the children of a <i>Zambrano </i>carer than practical support
sufficient to avoid their being obliged to leave the Union, that also sets the
limits of what is involved in its implementation. Although it is open to the
state to provide more generous support (“gold-plating”, as it is sometimes
called), that is the exercise of a choice under national law, not EU law. To
describe this as “regulating” the financial assistance given to the EU carer
does not alter that fact. Just as Mr Ymeraga could not rely on the Charter to
extend the derivative rights otherwise available to his family members, so Mrs
HC cannot rely on it to give her any entitlement to financial assistance beyond
the limited support required by the <i>Zambrano </i>principle itself.</a></p><a name="para28">

</span>The point does not bear of much elaboration, but the conclusion is
sufficient to dispose of this issue in favour of the Secretary of State. It is
unnecessary therefore to consider the interesting questions which would have
arisen under article 21, had the Charter been held to apply.</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Discrimination under the Convention</b></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I can deal relatively briefly with this issue, which was not developed
in any great detail by Mr Drabble, other than by repetition of the arguments
advanced in respect of article 21 of the Charter. In short, he submits that the
amendment regulations have an impact within the ambit of article 8, or article
1 of the First Protocol, and that accordingly there is right under article 14
not to be discriminated against without reasonable justification.</a></p><a name="para30">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unnecessary for present purposes to enter into the continuing
debate about the application to benefits of this kind of article 8, as opposed
to article 1 of the First Protocol) (see per Collins J <i>R (DA) v Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/1446.html">[2017] EWHC 1446 (Admin)</a>, paras 39-40). I am
prepared to proceed on the basis that the case falls within the ambit of
convention rights so as potentially to engage article 14. That article
provides:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The enjoyment of the rights and
freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination
on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority,
property, birth or other status.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The “status” on which Mr Drabble relies, as I understand
his submission, is either immigration status, or, more narrowly, the status of <i>Zambrano
</i>carer and child. I do not think that either can assist him under article
14. Discrimination on the basis of immigration status is of course a
fundamental and accepted part of both EU and national law, but cannot in itself
give rise to an issue under article 14. In so far as Mrs HC’s differential
treatment arises from her status as a third country national, she can have no
complaint. So far as concerns her <i>Zambrano </i>status, that is a creation of
European law, and such differences of treatment as there are, as compared to
other categories of resident, do no more than reflect the law by which the
status is created.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, the Strasbourg court has long accepted that the allocation
of limited public funds in the social security and welfare context is
pre-eminently a matter for national authorities, subject only to the
requirement that their decisions should not be “manifestly without reasonable
foundation” (see <i>R (MA) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Equality
and Human Rights Commission intervening) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/58.html">[2016] 1 WLR 4550</a>, para 32 per
Lord Toulson). The government’s reasons for not providing support to <i>Zambrano
</i>carers, as explained in the evidence of Mr Gareth Cooper, included the
objectives of reducing costs by allocating benefits to those with the greatest
connection with this country, of encouraging immigrants here unlawfully to
regularise their stay, of encouraging TCNs wishing to have children here to
ensure that they had sufficient resources to support themselves and their children,
and of reducing “benefits tourism”. Like Arden LJ in the Court of Appeal (para
96) in spite of criticisms made by Mr Drabble, I find it impossible to say that
these objectives fall outside the wide margin of discretion allowed to national
governments in this field.</p>

</span>As I have said, no issue arises in this appeal as to the scope of the
local authority’s duties under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and we have
heard no argument upon them. However, it has emerged as an important aspect of
the government’s response to <i>Zambrano </i>principle, which may not have been
anticipated at the time that the amending regulations were being prepared.
There is no indication that it was the subject of discussion between central
and local government at that time. Mr Cooper does no more than refer to the
actions taken by the Oldham Borough Council, as the responsible local authority
under that Act. He does not suggest that section 17 formed any part of the
government’s thinking when preparing the regulations, or of any impact
assessment then carried out. Nor have we heard any submissions from the Oldham
Borough Council itself. However some brief comment may be appropriate.</a></p><a name="para33">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 17(1) imposes a “general duty” on local authorities:</a></p><a name="para34">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to safeguard and promote
the welfare of children within their area who are in need; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so far as is consistent
with that duty, to promote the upbringing of such children by their families,</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">by providing a range and level of
services appropriate to those children’s needs.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The services so provided may include providing
accommodation and giving assistance in kind or in cash (section 17(6)). A child
is taken to be in need for this purpose if (inter alia) -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… he is unlikely to achieve or
maintain, or to have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining, a reasonable
standard of health or development without the provision for him of services by
a local authority under this Part.” (section 17(10))</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">More detailed provision as to how that duty is to be
carried out is contained in Schedule 2 to the Act. Also relevant is section 11
of the Children Act 2004, which requires local authorities to make arrangements
to ensure that “their functions are discharged having regard to the need to
safeguard and promote the welfare of children” (section 11(2)(a)); and in so
doing to have regard to any guidance given to them for the purpose by the
Secretary of State (section 11(4)).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scope of the section 17 duty was considered by the Court of Appeal
in <i>R (C) v London Borough of Southwark</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/707.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 707</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/707.html">[2016] HLR 36</a>. That case concerned assistance provided to children of a Nigerian mother
following the refusal of leave to remain, and pending their return to Nigeria.
The court rejected, on the evidence, a claim that the authority had applied an
unlawful policy of setting financial support by reference to levels of child
benefit, or to amounts paid by the Secretary of State to asylum-seekers, rather
than by way of assessing their actual needs. In the leading judgment Ryder LJ
described the duty in these terms:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is settled law that
the section 17 scheme does not create a specific or mandatory duty owed to an
individual child. It is a target duty which creates a discretion in a local
authority to make a decision to meet an individual child's assessed need. The decision
may be influenced by factors other than the individual child’s welfare and may
include the resources of the local authority, other provision that has been
made for the child and the needs of other children … Accordingly, although the
adequacy of an assessment or the lawfulness of a decision may be the subject of
a challenge to the exercise of a local authority’s functions under section 17,
it is not for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the local
authority on the questions whether a child is in need and, if so, what that
child's needs are, nor can the court dictate how the assessment is to be
undertaken …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="text-indent:36.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A local authority that
provides support for children in need under the 1989 Act is acting under its
powers as a children’s services authority (a local social services authority
with responsibility for children) not as a local social services authority
performing functions relating to homelessness and its prevention, and not as a
local housing authority. The limited nature of the local authority's power is
important. The local authority appropriately remind this court of the statement
of principle in this regard which is to be found in <i>R (Blackburn Smith) v
London Borough of Lambeth</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/767.html">[2007] EWHC 767 (Admin)</a> at para 36 per Dobbs J:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘… the defendant’s powers [under
section 17] were never intended to enable it to act as an alternative welfare
agency in circumstances where Parliament had determined that the claimant

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As that judgment makes clear, section 17 is designed to cover a wide
range of circumstances in which a local authority may need to take action to
protect the interests of children in their area, temporary (as in that case) or
more long-lasting. The duty arising in the present context is perhaps unusual
in that arises from a responsibility imposed by EU law on member states. It is
also likely to continue so long as no other sources of support are available to
the child. On the view I have taken the allocation of responsibility for that
support, as between central and local government, is an issue of national
rather than EU law. However, that does nothing to diminish the importance of
the duty.</a></p><a name="para36">

</span>It must always be remembered that the primary objective is to promote
the welfare of the children concerned, including the upbringing of such
children by their families. The assessment of need must remain the
responsibility of the local authority (as Ryder LJ made clear), but, given that
this is a national responsibility, it is clearly desirable that there should be
a degree of consistency as between authorities. The legislation allows for the
provision of national guidance. Judicial review is available as a backstop, but
it is likely to be unsatisfactory for the levels of appropriate support to be
left for determination by the individual authorities on a case-by-case basis,
subject only to control by the courts by reference to conventional <i>Wednesbury
</i>principles. On this aspect I agree also with the observations of Lady Hale
at paras 43-46 of her judgment.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>I have found this a very troubling case. It is not a case about adults’
rights. It is a case about children’s rights - specifically the right of these
two very young British children to remain living in their own country and to
have the support which they need in order to enable them to do so.
Self-evidently they need the support of their mother in the shape of the care
which she is able to give them. But they also need support in the shape of a
place to live and enough to live on.</a></p><a name="para39">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Yet this is not the way in which the policy-makers who framed the
various Regulations which are under attack in these proceedings saw the matter.
They saw it solely in terms of the mother and other <i>Zambrano </i>carers like
her, as third country nationals who should be put in the same position as any
other third country national. Third country nationals are not, in general,
entitled to income-related benefits; and so (as Mr Gareth Cooper explains) the
Department for Work and Pensions extended this rule to <i>Zambrano </i>carers.
Third country nationals are only entitled to be allocated social housing or
given homelessness assistance if this accords with the Government’s immigration
and asylum policy, broadly only if they have leave to enter or remain without a
condition that they have no recourse to public funds; and so (as Ms Frances
Walker explains) the Department for Communities and Local Government excluded <i>Zambrano
</i>carers from eligibility. Third country nationals are only entitled to child
benefit and child tax credits in broadly the same circumstances; and so (as Mr
Phillip Dearne explains) Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs excluded them from
eligibility.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Yet <i>Zambrano </i>carers are not like any other third country
nationals. They have British (or other EU citizen) children dependent upon
them. That is why, because of the <i>Zambrano </i>decision, the Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) had to be amended to
give them the right to live and work here. There is not a hint in the evidence
which we have seen that any consideration was given to how these children would
be supported if the parent looking after them was unable to work, whether because
of the demands of child care or for any other good reason. We are told that the
Department of Work and Pensions consulted the local government associations
about the exclusion from benefits and the associations made no objection. We do
not know whether it had occurred either to central or to local government that
(unless there was family or charitable support) the only way in which these
children could escape destitution was through the powers of local children’s
services authorities under section 17 of the Children Act 1989. If that had
been made clear, one imagines that the local government associations might well
have expressed some concern about the transfer of this responsibility to them
without some corresponding transfer of the considerable sums entailed in
discharging this responsibility properly.</a></p><a name="para41">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 17 empowers and obliges local authorities to provide a range of
services to safeguard and promote the welfare of “children in need” and, so far
as is consistent with that duty, to promote their upbringing by their families.
It is a development of a duty dating back to the Children and Young Persons Act
1963 to provide families with help in order to avoid the need for children to
be taken into care or looked after by the local authority. It was not intended
to be a long-term substitute for social housing or means-tested benefits.
Fortunately, however, section 17(6) provides that “The services provided by a
local authority in the exercise of functions conferred on them by this section
may include providing accommodation and giving assistance in kind or in cash”.
As originally enacted, cash could only be provided “in exceptional
circumstances”, but those words were repealed in 2011, under powers granted by
the Children and Young Persons Act 2008.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 17 services have the great merit of flexibility. They can be
adjusted to the needs of the particular child or family. They may well be in
addition to the benefits and services to which the family are entitled under
other legislation and thus may provide assistance at a higher level than that.
But they have several disadvantages when compared with the benefits and
services from which these children and their carers are excluded. First, they
depend upon the local authority considering that the child is “in need” as
defined in section 17(10) and (11) (see para 34). This is a judgment to be made
by the local authority subject only to judicial review on the usual principles.
Second, they are discretionary and not as of right to those who qualify.
Indeed, it has been held that (unlike the duty to accommodate a child in
section 20 of the 1989 Act) the section 17 duty is a “target duty” rather than
a duty owed to any individual child. Third, there are no standard rates for
assistance in cash, as there are with state benefits generally, with the
consequent risk of inconsistency between authorities. Fourth, providing
assistance in cash does not automatically bring with it entitlement to other
assistance, such as free school meals, to which receipt of certain benefits is
a passport. Fifth, the only way in which a family can seek to challenge the
local authority’s decision is through judicial review, which is far more
limited in scope and accessibility than an appeal to the social entitlement
chamber of the First-tier Tribunal.</a></p><a name="para43">

</span>Thus, according to the mother’s evidence, when she approached the local
authority for the area where she was living with her husband, she was given her
train fare to travel north to the area where her sister and family were living.
This is a typical use of section 17 money. When she approached the local
authority for that area, because her sister could not house and feed her and
her child and her expected second child indefinitely, she was at first refused.
But eventually she was offered one room in a local hotel and £45 per week in
cash. That is how things stood when these proceedings were launched in July
2013. The local authority then reassessed the children’s needs and (through
their Head of Safeguarding, Mr Saul Ainsworth) offered them two-bedroomed
accommodation of the sort which would be offered to a family who may be
eligible for homeless accommodation and in effect to discharge her council tax
liability; £55 a week for subsistence, based on the UK Border Agency’s figures
for the amount needed to meet the needs of one adult and two children under
three (as they then were); and £25.50 a week for gas, electricity and water,
based on local inquiries. The annual cost of this package was estimated at
£11,368.76, while the local authority’s annual budget for section 17 support
was £12,000 (which is an indication that it is not expected to be used to
provide long term income support).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was on that basis that, on 1 August 2013, the proceedings against the
local authority were stayed while the proceedings against the Department of
Work and Pensions, the Department for Communities and Local Government and Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, challenging the various regulations, continued.
We are told that that is still the position today, although of course the local
authority may carry out a further review of the children’s needs, especially as
they are older now, and will no doubt have to do so if these proceedings are
concluded in the Government’s favour.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In carrying out that review, the local authority will no doubt bear in
mind, not only their duties under section 17, but also their duty under section
11 of the Children Act 2004, to discharge all their functions having regard to
the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, and their duty, under
section 175 of the Education Act 2002, to exercise their education functions
with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. Safeguarding
is not enough: their welfare has to be actively promoted. The authority will no
doubt take into account that these are British children, born and brought up
here, who have the right to remain here all their lives; they cannot therefore
be compared with asylum-seeking children or the children of asylum-seeking
parents, who may end up with no or only a limited right to remain. They will no
doubt also wish to take into account the impact upon the proper development of
these children of being denied a level of support equivalent to that of their
peers, that is, the other British children around them whose families are
dependent on income-related benefits. That level of support is not fixed at a
level designed to lift children out of poverty, as officially defined, but at a
level much closer to subsistence.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The above is, of course, premised on the dismissal of this appeal. <i>Zambrano
</i>and the later cases say nothing about entitlement to benefits, but they do
recognise that the children are dependent upon their parents, not just for
care, but also for financial support, at least if it is derived from the parents’
ability to work. The situation of <i>Zambrano </i>carers and their children
does not fall within the European Union legislation on access to social
security and other welfare benefits. All that <i>Zambrano </i>requires is that
the children are not effectively deprived of their rights as European citizens
by the situation in which they find themselves. Section 17 support, at least if
it is determined giving due weight to the factors suggested above, should be
sufficient to ensure that they are not effectively deprived of their rights as
British and European citizens.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So the questions of EU law which arise are, first, does the Charter of
Fundamental Rights apply, and second, what difference, if any, would it make if
it did? By article 51 of the Charter, its provisions are addressed to the
member states “only when they are implementing Union law”. The change to the
2006 Immigration Regulations, allowing <i>Zambrano </i>carers to live and work
here, was of course implementing Union law. But were the changes to the
Regulations at issue here doing so? They were in consequence of a development
in Union law, but they were not implementing it - in fact, quite the reverse.
Supposing that there had been no fall-back in the shape of section 17, this
could well have been a <i>failure</i> to implement Union law, leaving these
children and their carers without support in this country and thus effectively
obliging them to leave. But there is section 17, and in my view it is the
administration of section 17 which could be said to be implementing Union law,
by enabling these children to remain living in this country.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Assuming for the moment, without deciding, that the Charter can apply,
not only to domestic legislation which implements Union law but also to
domestic administration which does so, what difference would the Charter make
in this context? Article 24(1) requires that “Children shall have the right to
such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being”; section 17 of
the 1989 Act is designed as a way of doing this. Article 24(2) requires that
“In all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or
private institutions, the child’s best interests must be a primary
consideration”. This obligation is obviously derived from article 3(1) of the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, as was the obligation in
section 11 of the 2004 Act. Properly understood, they should amount to the same
thing.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By article 21(1) of the Charter, “Any discrimination based on any ground
such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language,
religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national
minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be
prohibited”. The discrimination complained of here is between two types of
British citizen child - the child who is being cared for by a third country
national with only <i>Zambrano </i>carer’s rights to be here, and the child who
is being cared for by a parent (or anyone else) who is entitled to claim income
related benefits, child benefit and child tax credit, and to seek social
housing and homelessness assistance. In general, of course, member states are
entitled to draw distinctions between different categories of their own
citizens, as long as these are not based on the listed personal
characteristics. But, at a stretch, it might just be possible to regard this as
a “ground such as” those listed.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If that were so, I am not impressed by the justifications given by the
respondents’ witnesses. These were justifications for exclusion from mainstream
benefits. They were addressed to the parents, viewed as third country nationals
rather than <i>Zambrano </i>carers, and not to the children. A child-focussed
approach would have been quite different. Thus the first aim, allocating
benefits to those with the greatest connection with this country, would
obviously include allocating benefits to British children who were born here
and have lived here all their lives. The second aim, of strengthening
immigration control, is irrelevant to children who are not subject to it. Their
<i>Zambrano </i>carers are only here to support them and for a long as they
need that support. A third aim, of saving money, is less than compelling, given
that what has in fact happened is a transfer of responsibility from one arm of
government to another. As we have seen, the sums involved for a local authority
such as this one are not negligible.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But if there is a need to avoid discrimination against the children of <i>Zambrano
</i>carers, this merely reinforces my view of what local authorities should be
taking into account when making their decisions about the level of support to
be provided under section 17. Section 17 is one way of providing these children
with what they need and deserve. That fact that there are other, and in some respects
preferable, ways of doing so does not mean that the United Kingdom is in breach
of its obligations under EU law. But no doubt local authorities would welcome
some guidance on how they should meet their responsibilities to children with <i>Zambrano
</i>carers (and even some help in doing so).</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, I agree that there is no question to be referred to
the Court of Justice of the European Union and this appeal should be dismissed.</a></p><a name="para53">
