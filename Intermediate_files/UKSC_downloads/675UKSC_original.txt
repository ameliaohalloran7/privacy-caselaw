</span>This appeal concerns the permitted uses of a retail store in Streatham
in the area of the London Borough of Lambeth (“the Council”). Planning
permission was originally granted by the Secretary of State in 1985, but the
use was limited by condition to sale of DIY goods and other specified
categories, not including food sales. Following implementation, the permitted
categories were extended by later consents (under section 73 of the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990), the most recent being in 2014 (“the 2014
permission”), which is in issue in this case. The second respondent sought a
certificate from the Council determining that the lawful use of the store
extended to sales of unlimited categories of goods including food. A
certificate to that effect was refused by the Council, but granted by a
planning inspector on appeal, and upheld by the lower courts. The Council, as
local planning authority, appeals to this court.</a></p><a name="para1">

</span>The original permission, granted by the Secretary of State on 17
September 1985 (“the 1985 permission”), was subject to a number of conditions,
including:</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The retail unit hereby
permitted shall be used for the retailing of goods for DIY home and garden
improvements and car maintenance, building materials and builders’ merchants
goods and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class I of the
Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1972 or in any
provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and
re-enacting that Order).”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The exclusion of use for other purposes, including those
within Use Class 1, had the effect of excluding (inter alia) food sales. The
following reason was given in the decision letter (para 16):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Because the traffic generation
and car parking requirements of certain types of large retail stores are
substantially greater than those of the DIY unit proposed and could be
excessive at this site, it is necessary to restrict the right to change to
other types of retail unit …”</p>

</span>On 30 June 2010, the Council granted a further planning permission (“the
2010 permission”) expressed to be for “Variation of Condition 6” of the 1985
permission to “allow for the sale of a wider range of goods” as specified, not
including food sales, and again excluding other uses within the relevant use
class (now Class A1). Although it is common ground that this permission was
granted under section 73, there was no specific reference to that section in
the document, which referred simply to the 1990 Act. This permission included,
as a separate condition 1, the same enumeration of permitted uses and
exclusions as in the terms of the grant, and the following reason was given for
the condition:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In order to ensure that the level
of traffic generation is such as to minimise danger, obstruction and
inconvenience to users of the highway and of the accesses.”</p>

permission:</a></p><a name="para4">

the Reasons for Granting Planning Permission:</a></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">In deciding to grant planning
permission, the Council has had regard to the relevant policies of the
development plan and all other relevant material considerations. … Having
weighed the merits of the proposals in the context of these issues, it is
considered that planning permission should be granted subject to the conditions
listed below.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Conditions</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development to
which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of
three years beginning from the date of this decision notice.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">Reason: To comply with the
provisions of section 91(1)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the variation
her[e]by approved being implemented a parking layout plan at scale of 1:50
indicating the location of the reserved staff car parking shall be submitted to
and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The use shall
thereafter be carried out solely in accordance with the approved staff car
parking details.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">Reason: To ensure that the approved
variation does not have a detrimental impact on the continuous safe an[d]
smooth operation of the adjacent highway …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within 12 months of implementation
of the development hereby approved details of a traffic survey on the site and
surrounding highway network shall be undertaken within one month of
implementation of the approved development date and the results submitted to
the local planning authority. If the traffic generation of the site, as
measured by the survey, is higher than that predicted in the Transport
Assessment submitted with the original planning application the applicant
shall, within three months, submit revised traffic modelling of the Woodgate
Drive/Streatham Vale/Greyhound Lane junction for analysis. If the junction
modelling shows that junction capacity is worse than originally predicted
within the Transport Assessment, appropriate mitigation measures shall be
agreed with the council, if required, and implemented within three months of
the date of agreement.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">Reason: to ensure that the
proposed development does not lead to an unacceptable traffic impact on the
adjoining highway network …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">There was no specific reference to conditions 2 and 3 of
the 2010 permission.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 10 June 2015, the second respondent applied to the Council for a certificate
of lawfulness of proposed use or development (under section 192 of the 1990
Act) for unrestricted use of the store. This was refused by the Council on 12
August 2015, but the appeal was allowed by the inspector by a decision letter
dated 6 December 2016. The letter gave a certificate of lawfulness for use
described as -</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The use of the premises … for
purposes within Use Class Al of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes)
Order 1987 (as amended) without restriction on the goods that may be sold.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The reason given was:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“No condition was imposed on [the
2014 permission] to restrict the nature of the retail use to specific uses

</span>It is unnecessary to set out the familiar provisions of the 1990 Act
relating to the definition of development, and to the granting of planning
permission. It is to be noted however that the extension of the categories of
goods to be sold within the store did not in itself amount to “development”
(within the meaning of 1990 Act section 55) requiring planning permission. The
erection of the building and the commencement of sales under the 1985
permission no doubt involved both operational development and a material change
of use. Thereafter a change to sale of other categories (at least those within
the relevant class under the current Use Class Order) would not involve any
breach of planning control unless restricted by an appropriate condition.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>Section 73 of the Act, on which the Council relied in granting the 2010
and 2014 permissions, is headed “Determination of applications to develop land
without compliance with conditions previously attached”. It provides:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section applies … to

</span>The background to this section (formerly section 31A of the Town and Country
Planning Act 1971) was described by Sullivan J in <i>Pye v Secretary of State
for the Environment, Transport and the Regions</i> [1998] 3 PLR 72:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Prior to the enactment of (what
is now) section 73, an applicant aggrieved by the imposition of the conditions
had the right to appeal against the original planning permission, but such a
course enabled the Local Planning Authority in making representations to the
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State when determining the appeal as
though the application had been made to him in the first instance, to ‘go back
on the original decision’ to grant planning permission. So the applicant might
find that he had lost his planning permission altogether, even though his
appeal had been confined to a complaint about a condition or conditions.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">It was this problem which section
31A, now section 73, was intended to address ...</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">While section 73 applications are
commonly referred to as applications to ‘amend’ the conditions attached to a
planning permission, a decision under section 73(2) leaves the original
planning permission intact and un-amended. That is so whether the decision is
to grant planning permission unconditionally or subject to different conditions
under paragraph (a), or to refuse the application under paragraph (b), because
planning permission should be granted subject to the same conditions.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">In the former case, the applicant
may choose whether to implement the original planning permission or the new
planning permission; in the latter case, he is still free to implement the
original planning permission. Thus, it is not possible to ‘go back on the
original planning permission’ under section 73. It remains as a base line,
whether the application under section 73 is approved or refused, in contrast to
the position that previously obtained.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The original planning permission
comprises not merely the description of the development in the operative part
of the planning permission ... but also the conditions subject to which the
development was permitted to be carried out ...”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">This passage was approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>Powergen
United Kingdom plc v Leicester City Council</i> [2000] JPL 1037, para 28, per
Schiemann LJ.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sullivan J’s comment that such applications are “commonly” referred to
as applications to “amend” the conditions was echoed by Schiemann LJ, who noted,
at para 1, that such an application is commonly referred to as “an application
to modify conditions imposed on a planning permission”. This usage is also
consistent with the wording used in the statute under which section 31A was
originally introduced. It was one of various “minor and consequential
amendments” introduced by section 49 and Schedule 11 of the Housing and
Planning Act 1986, described as “(d) applications to vary or revoke conditions
attached to planning permission”.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear, however, that this usage, even if sanctioned by statute, is
legally inaccurate. A permission under section 73 can only take effect as an
independent permission to carry out the same development as previously
permitted, but subject to the new or amended conditions. This was explained in
the contemporary circular 19/86, para 13, to which Sullivan J referred. It
described the new section as enabling an applicant, in respect of “an extant
planning permission granted subject to conditions”, to apply “for relief from
all or any of those conditions”. It added:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the authority do decide that
some variation of conditions is acceptable, a new alternative permission will
be created. It is then open to the applicant to choose whether to implement the
new permission or the one originally granted.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the section refers to “development” in the future, it is not in
issue that a section 73 application can be made and permission granted
retrospectively, that is in relation to development already carried out. This
question arose indirectly in the courts below, in the context of a dispute
about the validity of the time-limit condition (condition 1), which required
the “development to which this permission relates” to be begun within three
years. The Court of Appeal upheld the inspector’s decision that this condition
was invalid, in circumstances where the relevant “development” had been carried
out many years before. Lewison LJ said:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I cannot see that the decision notice
granted planning permission for any prospective development. The mere widening
of the classes of goods that were permitted to be sold by retail does not
amount to development at all. Conformably with the definition of ‘development’
in section 55 the only development to which the application could have related
was the original erection of the store and the commencement of its use as a DIY
store. It was that development that was permitted subject to the conditions
that the application was designed to modify; and it was the planning permission
permitting that development to which the decision notice referred.” (para 79)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with that analysis, which is not I understand in dispute before
this court. However, it leaves open the question as to the effect of the new
permission on conditions which have already taken effect following
implementation of the earlier permission. The section does not assist directly.
It envisages two situations: either (a) the grant of a new permission
unconditionally or subject to revised conditions, or (b) refusal of permission,
leaving the existing permission in place with its conditions unchanged. It does
not say what is to happen if the authority wishes to change some conditions but
leave others in place. As will be seen (para 20 below), the Court of Appeal
cited government guidance indicating that “to assist with clarity” planning decisions
under section 73 “should also repeat the relevant conditions from the original
planning permission”. However, as I read this, it was given as advice, rather
than as a statement about the legal position. Although the current status of
the 2010 conditions is not directly in issue in the appeal, it is of some
background relevance and has attracted conflicting submissions. I shall return
to this aspect later in the judgment.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For completeness, before leaving this discussion of section 73, I should
note that circular 19/86 (referred to above) described its predecessor as
“complementing” section 32 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 (later,
section 63 of the 1990 Act), which at the time made specific provision for retrospective
permissions (“Permission to retain buildings or works or continue use of land”).
That section has since been repealed and partially replaced by section 73A of
the 1990 Act (see Planning and Compensation Act 1991, Schedule 7). Whatever the
precise significance of this change, it is not suggested that it has any
relevance to the issues in this appeal and neither side has sought to rely on
section 73A.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Principles of interpretation</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We have received extensive submissions and citations from recent
judgments of this court on the correct approach to interpretation. Most
relevant in that context is <i>Trump International Golf Club Ltd v Scottish
Ministers</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/74.html">[2015] UKSC 74</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/74.html">[2016] 1 WLR 85</a>. An issue in that case related to
the interpretation of a condition in a statutory authorisation for an offshore
wind farm, requiring the developer to submit a detailed design statement for
approval by Ministers. One question was whether the condition should be read as
subject to an implied term that the development would be constructed in
accordance with the design so approved.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the leading judgment Lord Hodge (at paras 33-37) spoke of the modern
tendency in the law to break down divisions in the interpretation of different
kinds of document, private or public, and to look for more general rules. He
summarised the correct approach to the interpretation of such a condition:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the court is
concerned with the interpretation of words in a condition in a public document
such as a section 36 consent, it asks itself what a reasonable reader would
understand the words to mean when reading the condition in the context of the
other conditions and of the consent as a whole. This is an objective exercise
in which the court will have regard to the natural and ordinary meaning of the
relevant words, the overall purpose of the consent, any other conditions which
cast light on the purpose of the relevant words, and common sense.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He rejected a submission that implication had no place in this context:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Counsel] submits that
the court should follow the approach which Sullivan J adopted to planning
conditions in <i>Sevenoaks District Council v First Secretary of State</i>
[2005] 1 P &amp; CR 186 and hold that there is no room for implying into
condition 14 a further obligation that the developer must construct the
development in accordance with the design statement. In agreement with Lord
Carnwath JSC, I am not persuaded that there is a complete bar on implying terms
into the conditions in planning permissions …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … While the court will,
understandably, exercise great restraint in implying terms into public
documents which have criminal sanctions, I see no principled reason for
excluding implication altogether.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In the instant case, had it been necessary to do so, he
would, at para 37, have “readily drawn the inference that the conditions of the

</span>In my own concurring judgment, having reviewed certain judgments in the
lower courts which had sought to lay down “lists of principles” for the
interpretation of planning conditions, I commented:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I see dangers in an approach
which may lead to the impression that there is a special set of rules applying
to planning conditions, as compared to other legal documents, or that the
process is one of great complexity.” (para 53)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Later in the same judgment, I added:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Any such document of course must
be interpreted in its particular legal and factual context. One aspect of that
context is that a planning permission is a public document which may be relied
on by parties unrelated to those originally involved … It must also be borne in
mind that planning conditions may be used to support criminal proceedings.
Those are good reasons for a relatively cautious approach, for example in the
well established rules limiting the categories of documents which may be used
in interpreting a planning permission … But such considerations arise from the
legal framework within which planning permissions are granted. They do not
require the adoption of a completely different approach to their
interpretation.” (para 66)</p>

</span>In summary, whatever the legal character of the document in question,
the starting-point - and usually the end-point - is to find “the natural and
ordinary meaning” of the words there used, viewed in their particular context
(statutory or otherwise) and in the light of common sense.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>It is unnecessary to review in any detail the reasoning of the inspector
or the High Court, since the issues, and the competing arguments, are fully
discussed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Having set out the planning
history and the terms of section 73, Lewison LJ (paras 19-22) identified what
he saw as the problem. While he acknowledged that it was “clear what Lambeth
meant to do in a very broad sense”, he said:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But that is not the question. The
question is: what did Lambeth in fact do? The application was an application
for the variation of a condition attached to the 2010 permission …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… the technical trap, into which
it is said that Lambeth fell, is that approval of an application under section
73 requires the grant of a fresh planning permission, rather than merely a
variation of an existing one …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">It follows from this that the decision
notice must be read as a free-standing grant of planning permission. However,
it failed to repeat any of the conditions imposed on the previous planning
permissions and, more importantly, failed to express the new description of the
use as a condition, rather than as a limited description of the permitted use
…”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">He noted the advice given in the relevant Planning Policy
Guidance note (“PPG”):</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para20">“It should be noted that the

<p class="ParaLevel1">This advice, he thought, was -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… reflective of the words of
section 73(2)(a) which requires a local planning authority, if it decides that

</span>Later in the judgment he addressed the submissions before the court. He
noted that Mr Reed QC for the Council put his argument in two ways: first by
implication of a condition and second as a matter of interpretation. He thought
it more logical to reverse the order, while accepting that the exercise was an
“iterative” process, and observing that the objective was</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… not to determine what the
parties meant to do in the broad sense, but what a reasonable reader would
understand by the language they in fact used.” (para 38)</p>

</span>Having referred to the findings of the judge in the court below, he
summarised Mr Reed’s submission on the interpretation of the decision notice:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of those
findings Mr Reed argues that the decision notice described itself as doing no
more than approving a ‘variation of condition’ in two previous planning
permissions. For technical reasons, however, a variation of a condition under
section 73 takes effect as the grant of a fresh planning permission. In order
to give effect to Lambeth’s intention and also to that of the applicant for the
variation of the condition, the limited description of the use must therefore
be read as if it were itself a condition.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the critical paragraphs of the judgment, he gave his view of how the
“reasonable reader” would have approached the matter:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasonable reader of
the decision notice must be notionally equipped with some knowledge of planning
law and practice. The distinction between a limited description of a permitted
use and a condition is a well-known distinction. The reasonable reader would also
know that the Government’s own guidance stated that any conditions applicable
to planning permission granted under section 73 must be explicitly stated. He
would know the general structure of a planning permission which will set out a
summary of the application, describe the development permitted by the
permission and, in a separate part of the permission, will set out any
conditions imposed on the grant of planning permission with reasons for those
conditions. He would notice that there were some conditions attached to the
grant which were explicitly stated in the decision notice, and that the decision
notice stated that Lambeth had decided that ‘planning permission should be
granted subject to the conditions listed below’. If he had looked back over the
planning history he would also have seen the 2010 approval of a variation to
the condition, which did specify the permitted range of goods in the form of a
condition. That had not been repeated in the decision notice. He would also
have noticed that the decision notice in 2010 had imposed two conditions
(relating to refuse and recycling on the one hand, and management of deliveries
on the other) which had also not been repeated in the decision notice. If he
had considered the 2013 refusal he would have seen that Lambeth was not
satisfied at that time that the applicant had demonstrated that increased
traffic would not lead to adverse impacts. But he would have seen that the decision
notice of 2014 referred to a traffic assessment which Lambeth had considered.
He would also have noticed that condition 3 required a traffic survey and the
implementation of mitigation measures if junction capacity was worse than
predicted. He might reasonably have concluded that Lambeth had been
sufficiently satisfied on this second application to grant conditional
permission, with the safety net of condition 3.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para23">53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, sympathetic
though I am to Lambeth’s position, this submission seems to me to go well
beyond interpretation. It is not a question of rearranging words that appear on
the face of the instrument (as in <i>Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/38.html">[2009] AC 1101</a>). It is a question of adding a whole condition, which has a
completely different legal effect to the words that Lambeth in fact used.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a further point he noted the statutory requirement for the notice to
state the reasons for any condition imposed. He said:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To impose a condition without
giving reasons for it would be a breach of statutory duty. It is one of the principles
of contractual interpretation that one should prefer a lawful interpretation to
an unlawful one. There is nothing in the decision notice which could amount to
a clear, precise and full reason for treating the description of the use as a
condition. Although Mr Reed suggested that the first reason given for the 2013
refusal could stand as the reason, I consider that to be untenable. The
requirement to give reasons is applicable to ‘the notice’. It may be that ‘the
notice’ might extend to another document incorporated by reference; but that is
not this case. Although the decision notice does cross-refer both to the
original planning permission and also to previous approved variations, it does
not mention the refusal at all. There would be no reason for a reasonable
reader of the decision notice to suppose that a reason for an unexpressed
condition was contained in a document which was simply part of the background.”

</span>Lewison LJ went on to deal with the alternative formulation, based on
implication of a condition in the same form as the “proposed wording”, holding
that it failed to meet the stringent tests laid down by the authorities (paras
63-75). In particular he accepted a submission by Mr Lockhart-Mummery that the
judgments in <i>Trump</i> (like the decision on which they relied: <i>Crisp
from the Fens Ltd v Rutland County Council</i> (1949-1951) 1 P &amp; CR 48)
decided no more than that implication might be made into an extant condition
that was incomplete; they did not contemplate the implication of a wholly new
condition (para 72).</a></p><a name="para25">

</span>In this court Mr Reed QC for the Council repeated and developed his
arguments in the Court of Appeal. In line with the decision of the High Court
in <i>I’m Your Man Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment</i> [1998] 4
PLR 107, he did not seek to argue that the proposed wording could be treated as
an enforceable “limitation”. He accepted the need to establish that the
permission was subject to a legally effective condition in that form. In
summary he put his case in three ways: (a) as a matter of the correct
interpretation of the permission; (b) by correction of an obvious error (by
analogy with the contractual principles applied in <i>Chartbrook Ltd v
Persimmon Homes Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/38.html">[2009] UKHL 38</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/38.html">[2009] 1 AC 1101</a>); (c) by the
implication of a condition in the terms of the proposed wording (applying the
principles in <i>Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKPC/2009/10.html">[2009] UKPC 10</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2009/10.html">[2009] 1 WLR 1988</a>). The respondents generally adopted the reasoning of
the Court of Appeal. Mr Kolinsky QC for the Secretary of State emphasised the
need for clarity and certainty in a public document. For the third respondent
(as freehold owner of the site), Mr Lockhart-Mummery reminded us that planning
is a creature of statute, in which common law principles have a limited role;
and also of the need for clear and specific words to exclude rights granted by
provisions such as the Use Classes Order.</p>

</span>With respect to the careful reasoning of the courts below, I consider
that an ordinary reading of the decision notice compels a different view. I
find it unnecessary to examine in detail the more ambitious alternatives
proposed by Mr Reed. However, I observe in passing (in agreement with Mr
Lockhart-Mummery’s submission as to the limited scope of the judgments in <i>Trump</i>)
that it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would be appropriate
to use implication for the purpose of supplying a wholly new condition, as
opposed to interpretation of an existing condition.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span>On the issue of interpretation, Lewison LJ was of course right to say
that the 2014 permission needs to be seen through the eyes of “the reasonable
reader”. However, such a reader should be assumed to start by taking the
document at face value, before being driven to the somewhat elaborate process
of legal and contextual analysis hypothesised in Lewison LJ’s para 52. In
essence Mr Reed’s submission, in the simple form recorded by Lewison LJ at para
45 (para 22 above) was in my view correct. It is not necessarily assisted by
the varying formulations and citations discussed in his submissions to this
court. There is a risk of over-complication.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Taken at face value the wording of the operative part of the grant seems
to me clear and unambiguous. The Council “hereby approves” an application for
“the variation of condition as set out below …”. There then follow precise and
accurate descriptions of the relevant development, of the condition to be
varied, and of the permission under which it was imposed. They are followed by
statements first of the “Original wording”, and then of the “Proposed wording”;
the latter stating in terms that the store is to be used for the sale of
“non-food goods only and … for no other goods”. “Proposed wording” in this
context must be read as a description of the form of condition proposed in the
application and “hereby” approved. In other words, the obvious, and indeed to
my mind the only natural, interpretation of those parts of the document is that
the Council was approving what was applied for: that is, the variation of one
condition from the original wording to the proposed wording, in effect
substituting one for the other. There is certainly nothing to indicate an
intention to discharge the condition altogether, or in particular to remove the
restriction on sale of other than non-food goods.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The suggested difficulties of interpretation do not arise from any
ambiguity in the terms of the grant itself. Nor do they raise any question
about the extent to which it is permissible to take account of extraneous
material. It is unnecessary to look beyond the terms of the document. In these
respects the case differs from many of the authorities to which reference has
been made in submissions. The arguments against this simple view turn, not on
any lack of clarity in the grant itself, but on supposed inconsistencies,
firstly with its statutory context, and secondly with the treatment of other
conditions in the remainder of the document.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In respect of the statutory context, the objection is that this reading
is inconsistent with the scope of the power under which the grant was made.
Section 73, referred to in terms in the permission, does not give the authority
power simply to vary a condition in the previous permission. That purpose could
only be achieved by the grant of a new permission, subject in terms to a
condition in the revised form. Accordingly, it is said, it was not enough
simply to approve the “proposed wording”, without its terms being incorporated
into the form of condition as required by section 73(2)(a).</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One problem with this argument is that it goes too far for the
respondents’ case. If section 73 gave no power to grant a permission in the
form described, the logical consequence would be that there was no valid grant
at all, not that there was a valid grant free from the proposed condition. The
validity of the grant might perhaps have been subject to a timely challenge by
an interested third party or even the Council itself. That not having been
done, there is no issue now as to the validity of the grant as such. All
parties are agreed that there was a valid permission for something. That being
the common position before the court, the document must be taken as it is.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may be that insufficient attention was paid in the submissions below
to the background of section 73, as discussed earlier in this judgment. Once it
is understood that it has been normal and accepted usage to describe section 73
as conferring power to “vary” or “amend” a condition, the reasonable reader
would in my view be unlikely to see any difficulty in giving effect to that
usage in the manner authorised by the section - that is, as the grant of a new
permission subject to the condition as varied. If the document had stopped at
that point, I do not think such a reader could have been left in any real doubt
about its intended meaning and effect. The lack of a specific reason for the
condition, to which Lewison LJ attached weight, is of little practical
significance, given that this was the relaxation of a previous condition for
which the reason was well-known, rather than the imposition of a new
restriction. In any event the absence of a reason would not affect the validity
of the condition (see <i>Brayhead (Ascot) Ltd v Berkshire County Council </i>[1964]
2 QB 303).</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to the second part of the notice, it is true that there are some
internal inconsistencies. Its heading suggests that it is simply stating the
reasons for the permission granted in the first part, rather than imposing a
separate set of conditions. Further, the wording of the conditions themselves
betrays some ambivalence about what has been approved. In some places it is
referred to as “the development to which this permission relates”, or “the
proposed development”, in others as “the variation hereby approved” or “the approved
variation”. (As I have already noted, the time-limit condition was held by the
courts below to be wholly invalid.)</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, reading the document as a whole, and taking the first part in
the sense suggested above, the second part can be given a sensible meaning
without undue distortion. It is explanatory of and supplementary to the first
part. The permitted development incorporating the amended condition is regarded
as acceptable, in accordance with the development plan, but only subject to the
conditions set out. They are in other words additional conditions. They are
designed to regulate the expanded use as permitted by the revised condition,
dealing in particular with staff parking, and monitoring of the additional
traffic impact.</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="ParaHeading">The other 2010 conditions</p>

</span>As I have said, we are not directly concerned in this appeal with the
status of the other conditions in the 2010 permission, so far as still
potentially relevant, notably conditions 2 and 3 relating respectively to
treatment of waste and management of deliveries. However, some comment may be
desirable, since the issue was subject to conflicting submissions before the
Court of Appeal and in this court. At first sight it would seem surprising if
the council, when relaxing the restrictions on sales, had not intended to
maintain such requirements. No reason was given for releasing them, and it does
not appear to have been requested in the application.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the Council, Mr Reed’s position seems to have shifted during the
course of the appeal below. Lewison LJ (paras 46-47) recorded his initial
submission that conditions 2 and 3 should be treated as incorporated into the
new permission; the “reasonable reader of the decision notice could not be
taken to understand that Lambeth was abandoning them”. However, this argument
was not pursued in his oral submissions (judgment paras 48, 51), and he seems
implicitly to have accepted that they would cease to be effective. In this
court this issue was not dealt with in any detail in the written submissions.
Questioned in argument, Mr Lockhart-Mummery QC for the third respondent
submitted that conditions 2 and 3, not having been repeated in the new
permission, must be taken as having lapsed altogether. In reply Mr Reed for the
Council took a rather different position to that initially taken in the Court
of Appeal. His submission as I understood it was that the 2010 conditions, so
far as still relevant, were not as such incorporated into the new permission;
but they continued to have effect under the 2010 permission, so far as not
inconsistent with anything in the new grant.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although we have not heard full argument, my provisional view is that Mr
Reed’s current submission is correct. It will always be a matter of
construction whether a later permission on the same piece of land is compatible
with the continued effect of the earlier permissions (see the principles
discussed in <i>Pioneer Aggregates (UK) Ltd v Secretary of State for the
Environment</i> [1985] AC 132, 144). In this case, following implementation of
the 2010 permission, the conditions would in principle remain binding unless
and until discharged by performance or further grant. Conditions 2 and 3 were
expressed to remain operative during continuation of the use so permitted. The
2014 permission did not in terms authorise non-compliance with those
conditions, nor, it seems, did it contain anything inconsistent with their
continued operation. Accordingly, they would remain valid and binding - not
because they were incorporated by implication in the new permission, but because
there was nothing in the new permission to affect their continued operation.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>This approach to the interpretation of the decision notice seems to me
consistent with the decision of Sullivan J in a case relied on by Mr Reed
before the Court of Appeal: <i>Reid v Secretary of State for Transport</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/2174.html">[2002] EWHC 2174 (Admin)</a>. Permission for a transport depot had been granted
subject to 12 conditions. The landowner applied for development described as
“retention of the use of the land without compliance with condition 2
(improvements to public highway) ...”. The local authority responded with a
notice referring to the terms of the application, and expressed in these terms
-</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… notice of its decision to
APPROVE Planning Permission for the application set out above subject to the

<p class="ParaLevel1">Sullivan J held that the grant did not mean that the other
conditions were no longer effective. He said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an apparent
conflict between the description of the proposed development, which refers not
to an existing use but to the retention of a permitted use without compliance
with one condition in the 1992 planning permission, and the words ‘Conditions:
None’. One is left wondering what is to happen to the remaining conditions on
the 1992 planning permission. Once it is accepted that both the application and
the 1992 planning permission referred to in the application for permission may
properly be considered for the purpose of construing the meaning of the 2002
permission, then the words ‘Conditions: None’ mean, in that context, no
additional conditions beyond those which had been imposed upon the 1992
permission.”</p>

permission, which was held to have the effect that “the conditions attached to
the previous planning permission continued to apply to the new one”. He saw it
as of no assistance in the present case, particularly given Mr Reed’s
abandonment before the Court of Appeal of the argument that the conditions
attached to the 2010 permission could be carried forward into the new
permission (para 51).</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>As I read the judgment, however, Sullivan J did not intend to say that
the other 11 conditions were by implication to be treated as included in the
new permission, or that the old permission was superseded. Rather the new
permission, confined as it was to the retention of the use without complying
with condition 2, and involving no inconsistency with the old permission and
the remaining conditions, had no effect on their continuing effect as
conditions subject to which the development had been carried out. The words
“Conditions: None” was indicating that there were to be no additional conditions
beyond those already having effect under the earlier permission. By contrast,
in the present case, the specific conditions in the 2014 permission were
intended to be additional both to the varied condition, and to the others
remaining in effect under the 2010 permission.</a></p><a name="para41">

</span>Sullivan J added the following comment:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“59.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept unreservedly
that the drafting of the 2002 planning permission could have been much clearer.
The inspector’s observations as to good practice should be heeded by all local
planning authorities. When issuing a fresh planning permission under section
73, it is highly desirable that all the conditions to which the new planning
permission will be subject should be restated in the new permission and not
left to a process of cross-referencing. Good practice was not followed in the
present case.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The present case illustrates the wisdom of that advice,
which is also reflected in the PPG. Nothing in the present judgment is intended
to detract from that advice, nor from the importance of ensuring that
applications and grants under section 73 are couched in terms which properly
reflect the nature of the statutory power.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Conclusions</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would allow the appeal. The precise wording of the
order should be agreed between the parties, or subject to further submissions.</a></p><a name="para43">
