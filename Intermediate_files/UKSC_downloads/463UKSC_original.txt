<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal raises two important and controversial questions of
commercial law. The first is: in what circumstances will the law treat the
authority of an agent as irrevocable. The other is whether the receipt of money
at a time when the recipient knows that imminent insolvency will prevent him
from performing the corresponding obligation, can give rise to liability to
account as a constructive trustee.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Angove’s Pty Ltd is an Australian winemaker, which for many years
employed an English company called D&amp;D Wines International Ltd as its agent
and distributor in the United Kingdom. D&amp;D acted in both capacities. It
bought wines from Angove’s in its own right and it sold wines on Angove’s
behalf to UK customers, generally retailers. Both activities were governed at
the relevant time by an Agency and Distribution Agreement (or “ADA”) dated 1
December 2011. Under clause 34, the ADA was terminable by either side on six
months’ notice, or, under clause 36, by notice with immediate effect in a
number of events, including the appointment of an administrator or liquidator.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 21 April 2012, D&amp;D went into administration, and on 10 July 2012
moved into creditors’ voluntary liquidation. At the commencement of the
administration, there were outstanding invoices amounting altogether to A$874,928.81,
representing the price of wine which D&amp;D had sold to two UK retailers, but
which the latter had not yet paid. On 23 April 2012, Angove’s gave written
notice terminating the ADA and any authority of D&amp;D to collect the price
from these two customers. The notice declared that Angove’s proposed to collect
the price directly from the customers and would account separately to D&amp;D
for their commission.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In due course, the liquidators objected to this course. They claimed to
be entitled to collect on the outstanding invoices, deduct commission due to
D&amp;D, and leave Angove’s to prove in the winding up for the rest of the
price. The liquidators have never denied that Angove’s was entitled to
terminate the ADA or that their notice of 23 April 2012 had that effect. But
they contended that the relationship between D&amp;D and Angove’s in relation
to the transactions covered by the invoices was that of buyer and seller, not
agent and principal, and that accordingly the company’s liability to Angove’s
at the commencement of the administration was a simple debt for goods sold and
delivered. Angove’s disputed this contention. They also argued that any moneys
held by D&amp;D for their account were held in trust for them. By agreement
between the parties, the sums paid to D&amp;D on the invoices after the notice
of termination were held by the liquidators in an escrow account pending the
resolution of the dispute, and the sums paid directly to Angove’s were held in
their solicitors’ client account on the same terms.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The matter came before His Honour Judge Pelling QC, sitting as a judge
of the High Court, on an application under section 112 of the Insolvency Act
1986 </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/215.html">[2013] EWHC 215 (Ch)</a>. He held that in the relevant respects the
relationship between Angove’s and D&amp;D was that of principal and agent only,
and that D&amp;D’s authority to collect the price from customers came to an end
upon service of Angove’s termination notice. In the Court of Appeal, the
liquidators did not challenge the judge’s finding that D&amp;D acted as agents.
Their case was that if D&amp;D acted in the relevant respects as agents, their
authority to collect the price of goods which they had sold on Angove’s behalf survived
the termination of the ADA because they needed it in order to recover their
commission. The Court of Appeal (Patten, Lewison and Sharp LLJJ) accepted this
argument and allowed the appeal on that basis <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/215.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 215</a>; [2014] 2
BCLC 129; Angove’s alternative case that the proceeds of the invoices were held
in trust for them failed at both stages, although for different reasons.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The revocability of an agent’s authority</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The general rule is that the authority of an agent may be revoked by the
principal, even if it is agreed by their contract to be irrevocable. The revocation
is effective to terminate the agent’s authority, but gives rise to a claim for
damages. Powers of attorney were said by Lord Kenyon to be “revocable from
their nature”: <i>Walsh v Whitcomb</i> </a><a href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1803/393.pdf">(1797) 2 Esp 565</a>, 566. In Story’s <i>Law
of Agency</i>, 2nd ed (1864), p 598, at para 463, the rule was said to be “so
plain a doctrine of common sense and common justice that it requires no
illustration or reasoning to support it.” Nonetheless, its basis has never
really been in doubt. An agent is empowered to commit his principal within the limits
of his authority as if the principal had agreed personally. This is a
confidential relationship importing a duty of loyalty, and normally of
undivided loyalty, on the part of the agent. As Lord Atkinson observed,
delivering the advice of the Privy Council in <i>Frith v Frith</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1906/8.html">[1906] AC 254</a>, 261, to allow the agent to exercise his authority after it has been
revoked would amount to the specific enforcement of a relationship which is by
its nature not specifically enforceable.</p>

</span>The main exception to the general rule is the case where the agent has a
relevant interest of his own in the exercise of his authority. The exception
applies if two conditions are satisfied. First, there must be an agreement that
the agent’s authority shall be irrevocable. Secondly, the authority must be
given to secure an interest of the agent, being either a proprietary interest
(for example a power of attorney given to enable the holder of an equitable
interest to perfect it) or a liability (generally in debt) owed to him
personally. In these cases, the agent’s authority is irrevocable while the
interest subsists.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both conditions are now reflected in section 4(1) of the Powers of
Attorney Act 1971, as regards authority conferred by a power of attorney. The
first condition is perhaps self-evident, but so far as authority is required,
it is supplied by the decisions of the Privy Council in<i> Esteban de Comas v
Prost and Kohler</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKPC/1865/1865_17.html">(1865) 3 Moo PC NS 158</a> and <i>Frith v Frith</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1906/8.html">[1906] AC 254</a>. The second condition was established in <i>Walsh v Whitcomb</i>, <i>supra</i>,
where the exception was said to apply in “every case where a power of attorney
is necessary to effectuate any security”. In <i>Smart v Sandars</i> <a href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1848/499.pdf">(1848) 2 CB 
895</a>, 917-918, commonly regarded as the leading case, Wilde CJ, delivering the
judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, declared that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“where an agreement is entered
into on a sufficient consideration, whereby an authority is given for the
purpose of securing some benefit to the donee of the authority, such an
authority is irrevocable. This is what is usually meant by an authority coupled
with an interest, and which is commonly said to be irrevocable. But we think
this doctrine applies only to cases where the authority is given for the
purpose of being a security, or, as Lord Kenyon expresses it, as a part of the
security; not to cases where the authority is given independently, and the
interest of the donee of the authority arises afterwards, and incidentally
only.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">These cases demonstrate that an agreement that the
agent’s authority is to be irrevocable may be inferred, but not from the mere co-existence
of the agency and the interest. It is necessary that the one should be intended
to support the other. The exception thus stated follows from the logic of the
rule. Where the parties agree that the agent is to have a personal financial
interest in the performance of his agency, over and above the receipt of his
remuneration, his duty of loyalty is to that extent compromised. The reason for
declining to enforce his right to act for the principal therefore falls away.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The ambit of the exception for authority coupled with an interest is
more narrowly defined by the editors of <i>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</i>,
20th ed (2014), para 10-007. They say that it applies</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“where the notion of agency is
employed as a legal device for a different purpose from that of normal agency,
to confer a security or other interest on the ‘agent’. In such a case it is
intended that the agent use the authority not for the benefit of his principal
but for his own benefit, to achieve the objects of the arrangement.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para9">This would appear to confine the exception to cases where
the authority exists solely in order to secure the agent’s financial interest,
and is in reality no more than the commercial equivalent of an assignment. In
such a case, the editors suggest, the law of agency is not really engaged at
all, because the beneficiary of the authority is only nominally an agent. In my
opinion, this is too narrow. It is no doubt a fair description of the simplest
cases, but I do not accept that it can be a general principle of law. At one
extreme lie cases such as <i>Walsh v Whitcomb</i>, <i>supra</i>, where a power
of attorney was granted solely to enable the grantee to satisfy a pre-existing
debt owed to the agent, or <i>Gaussen v Morton</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1830/564.pdf">(1830) 10 B&amp;C 731</a>, where
an owner of land gave a power of attorney to a creditor to sell the land to
satisfy the debt. No one doubts that the exception applies in such cases. At
the opposite extreme, it does not apply where the agent’s only interest is a
commercial interest in being able to earn his commission. The reason is that in
that case, the authority is not properly speaking a security at all: <i>Doward,
Dickson &amp; Co v Williams &amp; Co</i> (1890) 6 TLR 316; <i>Temple Legal
Protection Ltd v QBE Insurance (Europe) Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/453.html">[2009] Lloyd's Rep IR 544</a> , at
para 50. But there are situations lying between these polar positions where the
relationship of principal and agent is broader than the mere collection of
money to satisfy the agent’s debt, so that the agent may be said to act both
for himself and his principal. In <i>Smart v Sandars</i>, <i>supra</i>, for
example, the agent was a grain factor and the advances said to be secured by
the agent’s authority were made against the proceeds of sale of unsold grain.
It is clear that the agent would have succeeded but for the fact that the
advances had been made after and independently of the agency agreement so that
the latter could not be construed as securing them. There is no principled
reason why a true agent employed on his principal’s affairs should not also be
regarded as having a personal interest in the exercise of his authority sufficient
to make it irrevocable. Thus although, as I have said, the agent’s commercial
interest in continuing to act in order to earn commission is not enough to make
his authority irrevocable, his interest in recovering a debt in respect of
commission already earned may well be. There is no reason to distinguish a debt
arising in this way from any other debt, provided that it is sufficiently clear
that the parties intended that the agent’s authority should secure it.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are a number of special cases in which the authority of an agent
has been held to be irrevocable on what appears to be a wider basis. They
include the irrevocable authority conferred on the promoter of a public share
offering to subscribe for shares (<i>In re Hannan’s Empress Gold Mining and
Development Co (Carmichael’s Case)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1896/133.html">[1896] 2 Ch 643</a>), the irrevocable
authority conferred by a bidder on an auctioneer of land to execute the
memorandum of sale if it is knocked down to him (<i>Van Praagh v Everidge</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1902/96.html">[1902] 2 Ch 266</a>, reversed on other grounds <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1903/17.html">[1903] 1 Ch 434</a>), and the irrevocable
authority conferred by a Lloyd’s name on his managing agent to underwrite (<i>Daly
v Lime Street Underwriting Agencies</i> [1987] 2 FTLR 277, <i>Society of
Lloyd’s v Leighs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/2283.html">[1997] CLC 759</a> decided on other grounds in the Court of
Appeal The Times, 11 August 1997). The result in these cases was undoubtedly
convenient, but they do not lend themselves to analysis along the lines
discussed above. Nothing that I have said should therefore be taken to refer to
them.</p>

</span>At this point, it is necessary to look more closely at the terms of the
ADA. Clause 10 provided that where D&amp;D took Angove’s products as their
agents for sale, the terms of any sale should be the standard terms set out at
Annexure A. These were drafted on the footing that the parties to the contract
of sale were Angove’s and “the customer”, defined as “the person … who acquires
goods from Angove.” They provided for the purchaser to pay the price within 90

</span>Finally, it is necessary to refer to clause 37, which deals with certain
of the consequences of termination. This provides, so far as relevant:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon termination of this

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal held that D&amp;D’s authority was irrevocable
because the general rule that authority can be revoked “must yield to what the
parties have agreed should be their respective legal rights and obligations on
the termination of the agency” (para 25). Construing the ADA, they held that a
continuing right to collect the price from the customer was implicit in (i)
D&amp;D’s right to deduct commission from the price before remitting it to Angove’s,
and (ii) D&amp;D’s obligation to account to Angove’s for the price within 90
days of the bill, whether or not it had by then been received from the
customer. This was because these features of the agreement gave rise to
liabilities of Angove’s to D&amp;D, which could be set off against sale
proceeds in D&amp;D’s hands. It will be apparent from this that the Court of
Appeal applied only part of the test. The general rule is that an agent’s
authority is revocable even if it is agreed to be irrevocable. It cannot
therefore be enough to exclude the general rule that the authority is agreed to
be irrevocable. What has to be agreed is not just that the authority is to be
irrevocable but that it is intended to secure the financial interest of the
agent. Both are questions for the construction of the agreement. The Court of
Appeal did not address the latter criterion.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is convenient to deal with both conditions together. In my opinion,
neither of them was satisfied, for the following reasons:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>D&amp;D had express authority to collect from the customer under clause 22(b),
and it would have been simple enough to provide in terms that it was
irrevocable. But it is not expressed to be irrevocable or to survive the
termination of the agreement. So far as the language offers any indication, it
is to the opposite effect. By virtue of the final paragraph of clause 37,
authority to collect the price would survive the termination of the agreement
only if it constituted an “accrued right or remedy” of the agent. But it is
described in clause 22(b) as a responsibility, not a right. I would accept that
for the purpose of clause 37 a provision may be “expressed” to survive
termination if, although not spelled out in so many words, it is nevertheless a
sufficiently clear implication from the express terms. But for the following
reasons I consider that no such implication is possible.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first point to be made is that while D&amp;D assume the
“responsibility” of collecting payment from customers to whom they sell as
Angove’s agent, there is nothing to stop the customer from paying Angove’s
directly. Under the standard terms required to be agreed with the customer the
price is payable to “Angove”, which “means Angove Pty Ltd, and includes D&amp;D
Wines International Ltd, where it acts as agent for Angove Pty Ltd.” This is
consistent with clause 20, which envisages that payment may be made to Angove’s
by D&amp;D or directly by the customer. This makes it, as it seems to me,
difficult to regard collection from the customer as a right, as opposed to a
function of D&amp;D, and even more difficult to regard it as a security.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is correct that D&amp;D’s right to commission under clause 21 survives
the termination of the agreement, because it accrues unconditionally when the
sale is made, therefore before termination. But the question is whether the
right to deduct it from the price under clause 22(c) is a mere procedural
mechanism or a security. It is not the only way of recovering it. If the price
is paid directly by the customer to Angove’s, the commission is payable by
Angove’s directly. In that event D&amp;D would lose the ability to set off the
commission against any sale proceeds in their hands. But the irrevocability of
D&amp;D’s authority cannot be inferred from the mere fact that D&amp;D would to
some extent and in some circumstances benefit if it was so.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Much the same point may be made about D&amp;D’s obligation under clauses
20 and 22(c) to account to Angove’s for the price within 90 days of the bill of
lading date. This was a right of Angove’s. It accrued when the goods were
shipped, albeit that payment would not be due until later. It follows, as the
Court of Appeal held, that in relation to goods shipped before the termination
of the ADA it survived that event, just as it would have done if D&amp;D had
bought the goods in their own right. Clause 20 applies in both cases. It does
not, however, follow that D&amp;D had the continuing authority of Angove’s to
collect the price from the customer. Once they had paid the price to Angove’s,
they were entitled at common law to collect it from the customer on the ground
that they had compulsorily discharged the customer’s liability for the price: <i>Moule
v Garrett</i> (1872) LR 7 Ex 101; <i>Ibrahim v Barclays Bank Plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/640.html">[2013] Ch 400</a>. The source of this right is the law of unjust enrichment. It is not the
authority of Angove’s, who have no further standing in the matter once they
have been paid.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is inherently improbable that the parties should have intended the
authority to be irrevocable. They had expressly envisaged the possibility of
insolvency and provided for a mutual right of termination in that event. For an
exporter in particular, there are particular problems associated with financial
dealings with an insolvent agent for sale, which Angove’s clearly wished to
avoid. If the agent’s authority to collect money from third parties survives
termination the effect would be to secure D&amp;D’s right to 5% commission in
the event of the insolvency of Angove’s, but at far greater cost to Angove’s in
the event of the insolvency of D&amp;D. They would have to prove as unsecured
creditors in the liquidation for the remaining 95%.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I conclude that Angove’s notice of 23 April 2012 was immediately effective
to terminate D&amp;D’s authority to collect on the outstanding invoices.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>This means that it is strictly speaking unnecessary to deal with the
second point, namely whether the funds paid by customers to D&amp;D since the
commencement of the administration are held in trust for Angove’s. But since the
point is of some general importance and has been fully argued before us, I
think it right to deal with it. I do so on the assumption that (contrary to the
conclusion that I have reached) Angove’s notice of termination was not
effective to terminate D&amp;D’s authority to collect on the invoices.</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An agent has a duty to account to his principal for money received on
his behalf. It is, however, well established that the duty does not necessarily
give rise to a trust of the money in the agent’s hands. That depends on the
intentions of the parties derived from the contract, or in some cases from
their conduct. As a broad generalisation, the relations between principal and
agent must be such that the agent was not at liberty to treat as part of his
general assets money for which he was accountable to his principal. This will
usually, but not invariably, involve segregating it from his own money. The
editors of <i>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</i>, 20th ed (2014), 219, para
6-041, put the matter in this way:</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the present trend seems to be to
approach the matter more functionally and to ask whether the trust relationship
is appropriate to the commercial relationship in which the parties find
themselves; whether it was appropriate that money or property should be, and
whether it was, held separately, or whether it was contemplated that the agent
should use the money, property or proceeds of the property as part of his
normal cash flow in such a way that the relationship of debtor and creditor is
more appropriate.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The judge held that in principle any liability of D&amp;D
to account for money collected from customers under the ADA gave rise to a purely
personal liability sounding in debt, and not to a proprietary claim; whereas
money collected outside the ADA, after their authority had been terminated,
would be held in trust for Angove’s. However, he concluded that none of this
mattered because the proceeds of the invoices fell to be dealt with in
accordance with the escrow arrangements. There is no longer any issue on these
points.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal matters took a different turn. Before the hearing
of the appeal the court wrote to the parties drawing their attention to a
passage from the 18th edition of <i>Lewin on Trusts</i> (2006), which suggested
that the proceeds of the invoices might be held on a constructive trust for Angove’s
even if there was a continuing authority to collect it. In the 19th ed (2015),
the corresponding passage reads:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<b>Unconscionable assertion of
title to money payments by agents</b></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Money received by an agent, though
not held on an express trust for his principal, nor on a <i>Quistclose </i>trust,
may be held on a constructive trust for his principal on the ground that it
would be unconscionable for the agent to assert a title to the money having
regard to the circumstances of the agent at the time of receipt. Such a
constructive trust has been held to arise where the agent receives money from
his principal for application by the agent under a contract which the agent
will be unable to perform because of his pending insolvency, or where the agent
receives money from a third party for onward transmission to his principal
which he is unable to do in view of his insolvency, even though the contract
with the principal negatives an express trust.”</p>

</span><i>Neste Oy v Lloyd’s Bank Plc</i> concerned the right of the bank to
combine the accounts of an insolvent shipping agent called Peckston Shipping
Ltd (or “PSL”). PSL settled on behalf of their shipowner clients bills payable
to harbour authorities, pilots, fuel merchants, and other providers of goods
and services. The shipowners sometimes put them in funds in advance and
sometimes reimbursed them in arrears. The plaintiff shipowners claimed that the
unspent balance of six payments made by them to a general account of PSL were
held for them in trust. Their primary case was that the payments were subject
to an implied trust to pay the money to the suppliers. This arose either by
virtue of the agency relationship or as a special purpose (or <i>Quistclose</i>)
trust: see <i>Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/4.html">[1970] AC 567</a>.
Bingham J rejected this, but held that there was a constructive trust of the
sixth payment, which had been received after the directors of PSL had concluded
that their company was insolvent. The judge took as his starting point a
quotation from Story’s <i>Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence</i>, 2nd ed
(1839), vol 2, para 1255, which had been cited by Goulding J in <i>Chase
Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd</i> [1981] Ch 105, 117-118
as being “in accord with the general principles of equity as applied in
England”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the receiving of money which
consistently with conscience cannot be retained is, in equity, sufficient to
raise a trust in favour of the party for whom or on whose account it was
received. This is the governing principle in all such cases. And therefore,
whenever any controversy arises, the true question is, not whether money has
been received by a party of which he could not have compelled the payment, but
whether he can now, with a safe conscience, <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, retain
it.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Applying this statement to the facts before him, he held,
at p 666:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Given the situation of PSL when
the last payment was received, any reasonable and honest directors of that
company (or the actual directors had they known of it) would, I feel sure, have
arranged for the repayment of that sum to the plaintiff’s without hesitation or
delay. It would have seemed little short of sharp practice for PSL to take any
benefit from the payment, and it would have seemed contrary to any ordinary
notion of fairness that the general body of creditors should profit from the
accident of a payment made at a time when there was bound to be a total failure
of consideration. Of course it is true that insolvency always causes loss and
perfect fairness is unattainable. The bank, and other creditors, have their
legitimate claims. It nonetheless seems to me that at the time of its receipt
PSL could not in good conscience retain this payment and that accordingly a
constructive trust is to be inferred.”</p>

</span><i>In re Japan Leasing Europe Plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1998/322.html">[1999] BPIR 911</a> concerned what was
in effect a hire purchase agreement for an aircraft between four leasing companies
and Olympic Airways. The contract documentation provided for the payment of the
price in instalments to designated accounts in various currencies of one of the
lessors, Japan Leasing. Japan Leasing was to receive the money on behalf of
itself and the other three lessors. Japan Leasing went into administration, and
a month later received an instalment into the designated accounts. The issue
was whether the money was held in trust to pay their shares to the three other
lessors. The deputy judge rejected the primary argument of the three solvent
lessors that there was an express trust, but held that the last instalment was
held on a constructive trust for the other lessors. The judge referred to an
observation of the editors of <i>Bowstead and Reynolds</i> (currently the 20th
ed (2014), at p 219) immediately after the passage which I have quoted above:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a central question, really one of
policy, … is whether the rights of the principal are sufficiently strong and
differentiable from other claims, for him to be given priority in respect of
them in the agent’s bankruptcy.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This had been quoted with apparent approval by Lord Goff of
Chieveley in <i>Lord Napier and Ettrick v Hunter</i> [1993] AC 713, 744,
although it was not the ground on which he decided that case. The deputy judge
then referred, at pp 922-923, to Bingham J’s decision in <i>Neste Oy</i>. He
was invited to distinguish it on the ground that in <i>Neste Oy</i> the agent
had no contractual right to the sixth payment. The money had been destined for
the payment of service-providers who were not beneficiaries of the trust. The
only consideration which the agent gave was its performance of its general
obligations as a shipping agent, and that was the consideration for its
charges, not for the sixth payment. Japan Leasing, by comparison, was
contractually entitled to receive the money. Although it was accountable for
most of it to the other three lessors, it had given consideration for its share
of the instalments. The deputy judge rejected this distinction because it was irrelevant
to Bingham J’s reasoning:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The constructive trust is imposed
because it would be unconscionable for the company, as agent, to receive money
as agent knowing that it could not account for it to its principal. In this
context, the passage from Bowstead quoted in <i>Napier </i>(see above) is
relevant and in my judgment the only answer which could be given to the
question there posed is that the rights of the vendors are sufficiently strong,
and differentiable from other claims, for the vendors to be entitled to a prior
position in respect of them on the company’s insolvency (whether the question
arises in an administration, a voluntary arrangement or a liquidation). The
joint administrators have not, of course, acted unconscionably: they have,
quite properly, brought the matter before the court. But it would, in my
judgment, be unconscionable for them to continue to assert any claim to the
moneys.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The distinction which Nicholas Warren QC rejected was, however, accepted
by the Court of Appeal in the present case. They justified the result in<i>
Neste Oy</i> on the ground that the payments to PSL were “essentially
gratuitous”, and that the treatment of the sixth payment as part of the
insolvent estate would have been a “real windfall for the creditors”. The
position in<i> Japan Leasing</i>, they thought, was different, for the reason
unsuccessfully submitted to Nicholas Warren QC. The Court of Appeal therefore
doubted whether the decision was right. On the footing that D&amp;D had a
contractual right to collect the proceeds of the invoices in order to recover
their commission on the sales, they thought that it could not have been
unconscionable for D&amp;D to retain the money and that there was no
constructive trust.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with the Court of Appeal that there was no constructive trust in
this case. But this conclusion does not in my view depend on whether D&amp;D
gave consideration for the money. There are, I think, more fundamental
objections to the constructive trust proposed by Angove’s.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time when the money was paid by the customers to D&amp;D it was
not impressed with any trust in favour of Angove’s. If, therefore, a
constructive trust came into being, it did so for the first time upon its reaching
the hands of the payee. The money would thereafter be traceable for as long as
it remained identifiable in the hands of any third party other than a bona fide
purchaser for value without notice. It would not form part of the insolvent
estate, thereby conferring priority on Angove’s over other creditors, including
many whose position would otherwise be no different from theirs. This is
elementary, and fundamental. The statutory rules for the distribution of
insolvent estates represent an important public policy designed to achieve a
pro rata distribution of the company’s estate between its creditors. For that
purpose it is necessary to assess claims as at a fixed and common point of
time, namely when the company went into liquidation. The arbitrary character of
any cut-off date is to some extent mitigated by statutory provisions for
adjusting prior transactions prejudicial to creditors, such as preferences and
transactions at an undervalue, and imposing liabilities for fraudulent or
wrongful trading, but these provisions operate in their current form to restore
the insolvent estate for the benefit of creditors as a whole.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is inherent in the statutory scheme of distribution in an insolvency that
apparently arbitrary results may follow from the adventitious timing of the commencement
of the liquidation, especially in the case of deferred obligations. In
principle, an advance payment to a company made before the commencement of the
liquidation for an obligation performable afterwards will form part of the
company’s estate, notwithstanding that its supervening insolvency means that
the obligation will not be performed, at any rate in specie. The payer must
prove in the liquidation for damages for the breach of contract. Likewise, a
contractor providing goods or services on credit will have to prove in the
liquidation for the price if the other party becomes insolvent before paying. The
rule is the same for money received for his principal’s account by an agent who
becomes insolvent before accounting for it, unless (contrary to the
unchallenged finding of the judge in this case) the relations between the
parties were such as to make the agent an express trustee of money in his
hands. The money will form part of the agent’s insolvent estate, and the
principal must prove in the liquidation. In the nature of things, these
consequences involve a detriment for the payer, attributable to the timing of
the company’s insolvency; and a windfall for the general creditors, since the
estate available for distribution will be increased by the payment without
being reduced by the cost of performance. As Professor Goode has remarked,</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is when [scholars] seek to …
argue for a proprietary right when there is no proprietary base that the line
is crossed between what is fair and what is not, for it is the defendant’s
unsecured creditors who are then at risk. If the court wishes to show its
disapproval of the defendant’s conduct by making a personal restitutionary
order, no harm is done. If the defendant is not in bankruptcy the order will be
complied with and enforced for the plaintiff’s benefit, if the defendant does
become bankrupt before then, the plaintiff is properly required to compete with
other unsecured creditors. To accord the plaintiff a proprietary right to the
benefit obtained by the defendant, and to any profits or gains resulting from
it, at the expense of the defendant’s unsecured bankruptcy creditors seems
completely wrong, both in principle and in policy, because the wrong done to
the plaintiff by the defendant’s improper receipt is no different in kind from
that done to creditors who have supplied goods and services without receiving
the bargained for payment”: Goode, ‘Ownership and Obligation in Commercial
Transactions’ (1987) 103 LQR 433, 444.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">What in effect Bingham J decided in <i>Neste Oy</i> was
that the position was different where at the time of the receipt of the money
the payee knew that there was bound to be a total failure of consideration. In
that event, he would have not just a personal but a proprietary restitutionary
claim for the money.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>English law is generally averse to the discretionary adjustment of
property rights, and has not recognised the remedial constructive trust favoured
in some other jurisdictions, notably the United States and Canada. It has
recognised only the institutional constructive trust: <i>Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html">[1996] AC 669</a>,
714-715 (Lord Browne-Wilkinson), <i>FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital
Partners LLC</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/45.html">[2015] AC 250</a>, at para 47. In the former case, the difference
was explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the following terms:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Under an institutional
constructive trust, the trust arises by operation of law as from the date of
the circumstances which give rise to it: the function of the court is merely to
declare that such trust has arisen in the past. The consequences that flow from
such trust having arisen (including the possibly unfair consequences to third
parties who in the interim have received the trust property) are also
determined by rules of law, not under a discretion. A remedial constructive
trust, as I understand it, is different. It is a judicial remedy giving rise to
an enforceable equitable obligation: the extent to which it operates
retrospectively to the prejudice of third parties lies in the discretion of the
court.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Bingham J’s point of departure in<i> Neste Oy</i> was that the recipient
of money may be liable to account for it as a constructive trustee if he cannot
in good conscience assert his own beneficial interest in the money as against
some other person of whose rights he is aware. As a general proposition this is
plainly right. But it is not a sufficient statement of the test, because it
begs the question what good conscience requires. Property rights are fixed and
ascertainable rights. Whether they exist in a given case depends on settled
principles, even in equity. Good conscience therefore involves more than a
judgment of the relative moral merits of the parties. For that reason it seems
to me, with respect, that Bingham J’s observation in<i> Neste Oy</i> that any
reasonable and honest director would have returned the sixth payment upon its
receipt begs the essential question whether he<i> should</i> have returned it.
It cannot be a sufficient answer to that question to say that it would be
“contrary to any ordinary notion of fairness” for the general creditors to
benefit by the payment. Reasoning of this kind might be relevant to the
existence of a remedial constructive trust, but not an institutional one. The
observation of the editors of<i> Bowstead and Reynolds</i> and of Nicholas
Warren QC in <i>Japan Leasing</i> that a proprietary claim should be recognised
whenever the claim is “sufficiently strong and differentiable from other
claims” to warrant giving it priority over other claims in an insolvency, seems
to me to be open to the same objection.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In English law, one of the essential requisites for a trust of whatever
kind is that there must be identifiable trust property (or its traceable
proceeds) in the hands of the recipient which are not available to him as part
of his general assets: see <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington
London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html">[1996] AC 669</a>, 705. The only true exception to this
(which did not arise in <i>Neste Oy</i>) is the case of a person liable to
account as a constructive trustee on the ground of his dishonest assistance in
a breach of trust. The difficulty about the decision in <i>Neste Oy</i>
concerning the sixth payment is that Bingham J had rejected the argument that
the agency relationship between the shipowners and PSL was such as to impose
the status of a trustee on the agents, and had declined to find that the
payments were subject to a special purpose trust. He had rejected these
submissions mainly because the agent was not expected to keep the funds
remitted to it by the shipowners separate from its own, but was entitled to
treat them as part of its general assets: see pp 664-665. It follows that in
paying money to PSL the shipowners intended to part with any interest in the
money, subject only to a purely personal obligation of PSL to account to them
for what they had done with it and to repay any balance due as a debt. The
judge made a similar finding in the present case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The exact circumstances in which a restitutionary proprietary claim may
exist is a controversial question which has given rise to a considerable body
of judicial comment and academic literature. For present purposes it is enough
to point out that where money is paid with the intention of transferring the
entire beneficial interest to the payee, the least that must be shown in order to
establish a constructive trust is (i) that that intention was vitiated, for
example because the money was paid as a result of a fundamental mistake or
pursuant to a contract which has been rescinded, or (ii) that irrespective of
the intentions of the payer, in the eyes of equity the money has come into the
wrong hands, as where it represents the fruits of a fraud, theft or breach of
trust or fiduciary duty against a third party. One or other of these is a
necessary condition, although it may not be a sufficient one. Neither of them
was satisfied in <i>Neste Oy</i>. In particular, the prospect of a total
failure of consideration, however inevitable, is not a circumstance which could
have vitiated the intention of the shipowner to part with its entire interest
in the money. The right to the restitution of money paid on a consideration
which has wholly failed is simply a process of contractual readjustment, giving
rise like the contract itself to purely personal obligations. If an actual
total failure of consideration does not give rise to a proprietary
restitutionary right, I do not see how a prospective one can do so.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the decision in <i>Neste Oy</i> cannot be justified, at any
rate on the ground on which it was decided. <i>Japan Leasing</i> was in my view
wrongly decided, not just for that reason, but for the reason given by the
Court of Appeal, namely that the recipient having a contractual right to the money,
it could not be unconscionable for them to receive it into their account.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mistake was not argued in <i>Neste Oy</i>. Bingham J had refused to
allow the shipowners to rely on it because they took the point too late. But it
has subsequently been suggested that since the shipowners presumably paid the
money in the belief that PSL was in a position to disburse it to the
service-providers, mistake would have been a better basis for the decision: <i>In
re Farepak Food and Gifts Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2006/3272.html">[2008] BCC 22</a>, at paras 39-40 (Mann J).
Whether that is correct is not a question which arises on this appeal. The
money was paid to D&amp;D by the customers, not by Angove’s. They no doubt paid
it in the belief that D&amp;D was authorised to collect it, or at least that
payment to them would discharge their liability for the price. The question of
trust arises on the hypothesis that D&amp;D was authorised to collect the
proceeds of the invoices, and on that hypothesis their belief was not mistaken.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would allow the appeal and declare that the fund representing the
proceeds of the invoices is payable to Angove’s.</a></p><a name="para33">
