<p class="NewSpeech">LORD CARNWATH: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom
Lord Neuberger, Lord Clarke, Lord Reed and Lord Hughes agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant Ms Vida Poshteh arrived in this country in 2003 as a
refugee from Iran, where she had been subject to imprisonment and torture. She
gained indefinite leave to remain in 2009. She lives with her son born in 2007.
In October 2009 she applied to the respondent council for accommodation as a
homeless person. Since then she has been housed in temporary accommodation
provided by the council, which has been continued pending this appeal.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeal arises from her refusal in November 2012 of a “final offer”
of permanent accommodation at 52a Norland Road, London W11. Her grounds in
short were that it had features which reminded her of her prison in Iran, and
which would exacerbate the post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety attacks and
other conditions from which she suffered. Following a review, these grounds
were held insufficient to justify her refusal. The council’s decision was
upheld on appeal by the County Court (HH Judge Baucher), and by the Court of
Appeal (Moore-Bick and McCombe LJJ, Elias LJ dissenting).</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Permission to appeal to this court was granted on two issues:</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para3">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether <i>Ali v
Birmingham City Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/8.html">[2010] 2 AC 39</a> should be departed from in the light
of <i>Ali v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2015/924.html">(2016) 63 EHRR 20</a> and if so to what extent;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the reviewing
officer should have asked himself whether there was a real risk that the
appellant’s mental health would be damaged by moving into the accommodation
offered, whether or not her reaction to it was irrational, and if so, whether
he did in fact apply the right test.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The first issue raises an issue of general importance
relating to the application in this context of article 6 of the European
Convention on Human Rights. The second is directed to the reasoning of the
reviewing officer in the particular case.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The law</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unnecessary to rehearse the relevant provisions of the Housing Act
1996 Part VII in any detail. As is well known, the local housing authority is
under a duty to secure provision of “suitable” accommodation for a person who
is homeless and in priority need, and has not become homeless intentionally.
The critical provisions in this case are section 193(7) and (7F) which deal
with circumstances in which the duty ceases:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local housing
authority shall also cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the
applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of
his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses
a final offer of accommodation under Part 6.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(7F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local housing
authority shall not -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a final offer of
accommodation under Part 6 for the purposes of subsection (7);</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… unless they are satisfied that
the accommodation is suitable for the applicant and that it is reasonable for
him to accept the offer.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the issue turned not on the “suitability” of the
accommodation, but on whether it was reasonable for the appellant to accept it.
The decision-maker’s task was described by Ward LJ in <i>Slater v Lewisham London
Borough Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/394.html">[2006] EWCA Civ 394</a> (in terms which have not been
criticised):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In judging whether it was
unreasonable to refuse such an offer, the decision-maker must have regard to
all the personal characteristics of the applicant, her needs, her hopes and her
fears and then taking account of those individual aspects, the subjective
factors, ask whether it is reasonable, an objective test, for the applicant to
accept. The test is whether a right-thinking local housing authority would
conclude that it was reasonable that <i>this applicant</i> should have accepted
the offer of <i>this</i> accommodation.” (para 34)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The applicant may request a review of an adverse decision, by a senior

</span>The proper approach of the court when reviewing such a decision was
explained by Lord Neuberger in <i>Holmes-Moorhouse v Richmond upon Thames
London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/7.html">[2009] UKHL 7</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/7.html">[2009] 1 WLR 413</a>, paras 46ff. As he
said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … review decisions are
prepared by housing officers, who occupy a post of considerable responsibility
and who have substantial experience in the housing field, but they are not
lawyers. It is not therefore appropriate to subject their decisions to the same
sort of analysis as may be applied to a contract drafted by solicitors, to an Act
of Parliament, or to a court’s judgment.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, a
benevolent approach should be adopted to the interpretation of review
decisions. The court should not take too technical a view of the language used,
or search for inconsistencies, or adopt a nit-picking approach, when confronted
with an appeal against a review decision. That is not to say that the court
should approve incomprehensible or misguided reasoning, but it should be
realistic and practical in its approach to the interpretation of review
decisions.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The facts</b></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The background facts are set out in the leading judgment of McCombe LJ
in the Court of Appeal. For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the
sequence of events following the offer of the accommodation in Norland Road on
14 November 2012. It was a first floor, two-bedroom flat in a purpose-built
block dating from about 1985, owned by the Notting Hill Housing Group (“NHHG”).
The living-room had two windows, one round window three feet in diameter, and
the other rectangular three feet by five feet. Ms Poshteh went to see the flat
on 16 November 2012, accompanied by a representative from NHHG. Her concerns
about the physical features, not mentioned during the visit, were first raised
in her letter of 29 November 2012, in which she said:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“…[I] found the property scary
given my history of post-traumatic stress. The windows in the sitting room were
circle shaped and other windows were too small. The windows appeared to me as
cell windows. I found them quite frightening and reminded me of when I was in
prison in my country.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">I suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder, depression, panic and anxiety attacks, insomnia and nightmares
due to torture that I experienced whilst back home in Iran. I therefore do not
find it suitable to live in as my permanent home …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">She enclosed letters from a therapist, and her GP (a Dr
Sharma), which referred to her mental state and past trauma, and the need to
avoid accommodation in a high rise building requiring a lift, but said nothing
about the shape of the window. Her letter was treated by the council as a request
for a review, which, following reference to the council’s own medical advisers,
led to confirmation of the decision. However, following her appeal to the
county court, the council agreed to carry out a further review.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A solicitors’ letter written on her behalf on 30 August 2013 expanded on
her experience when viewing the property. This repeated her concerns, but for
the first time stated that viewing the flat had “sent her into a panic attack”.
The letter asserted (incorrectly) that the flat was in a high rise block with a
lift. The solicitors also provided further letters relating to her medical
condition, including a further letter from Dr Sharma, who understood the flat
had been rejected -</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“because the windows were very
small and round and she felt like she was back in a prison and this made her
scared because it reminded her of the torture she was subjected to.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">She thought that “this type of property” would be very
unsuitable for her as it would “continually trigger memories of her time in
prison and the torture she suffered and this would not be good for mental
state”. A clinical therapist (Ms Baroni) wrote:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my opinion the effect of being
housed in accommodation with very small dark rooms without windows at a normal
height and looking out onto everyday life would inevitably remind her of both
the cell she was confined in for six months, and the interrogation rooms she
was tortured in on many occasions …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">… if she were housed in
accommodation which would be frightening and stressful for her she might suffer
a serious relapse and not be able to look after her son safely.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 7 October 2013 Ms Poshteh attended an interview with the reviewing
officer. According to his note of the interview, her main reason for refusing
the property was the round window in the living room which she said was
“exactly similar” to the round windows of her cell in Iran. The note continues:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“When I questioned the applicant
further about the window she admitted that the round window in the living room
of the property was not exactly like the window in the prison cell. In fact,
the applicant acknowledged that the window in the prison cell was much smaller
and did not let in much light at all. She agreed with my description that it
was like a porthole window. The applicant also acknowledged that there was a
second large rectangular window located in the living room. However, she
advised that it still led her to have a panic attack when she viewed the
property. She stated that she could not adequately explain how she felt to the
officer from NHHG who accompanied her to the viewing …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">After discussion of other features of the flat which do not
appear to have caused her serious concern, the note continues:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Applicant stated at the interview
that the property would have been OK as TA [temporary accommodation] but not as
a permanent offer of accommodation in which she would have to live for ever.
She confirmed again that this was because of the window which led her to think
about her ‘bad past’… She stated that she could not accept the property because
of the round window in the living room.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reviewing officer’s decision came in a letter dated 17 October 2013,
running to ten pages. He outlined the history of the case, including the
medical evidence, the solicitors’ representations and the matters raised at the
interview of 7 October, and he described the dimensions and physical features
of the accommodation. The critical part begins at para 39 where, having found
that the accommodation was objectively “suitable”, he said:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I nevertheless acknowledge that
objectively suitable accommodation may be unsuitable for a particular applicant
if it causes them to suffer from symptoms of mental illness. Indeed, the main
issue in reviewing our homelessness decision is to consider whether this offer
of accommodation was reasonable for you to have accepted given your history of
imprisonment and ill-treatment in Iran and your subsequent diagnosis of PTSD
and associated problems of severe anxiety and depression.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He then gave his reasons for answering that question in the affirmative
(paras 41-45). He acknowledged that “accommodation which is, for example,
cramped or contains small or barred windows could exacerbate symptoms of PTSD
in someone who has experienced trauma in prison”. However, he thought it
“highly relevant” that the medical evidence, while reporting her own concerns,
did not purport to state that the property was unsuitable on medical grounds or
that it was not reasonable for her to accept it. The clinical therapist had
spoken of “very small dark rooms without windows at a normal height and looking
out onto everyday life” as inevitably reminding her of her detention; but the
reviewing officer did not think the property met this description. He turned to
consider whether “the assertions” she had made to her physicians about the
window size and the arrangement in the living room were consistent with the
floor plan and photographs provided by NHHG:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Far from being small, the
circular window is in fact seven square feet in size and provides sufficient
natural light to meet the relevant edition of the building regulations. When we
discussed this at interview you acknowledged that the circular window was in
fact much larger than the circular window in your prison cell, and that the
only similarity lay in the fact that both were circular.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Moreover, the circular window was not the only window in
the living room, natural light being also provided by “a large rectangular bay
window (15 square feet in size) with views onto the street”. The combination of
these two windows “far from creating the dark and airless conditions normally
associated with a prison cell”, maximised natural light in the living room. He
continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I cannot
accept as objectively reasonable your assertion that the size or design of the
window in the living room was reminiscent of a prison cell or that the windows
or layout of the living room is such that it recreated the conditions of
confinement or incarceration that is likely to have a significant impact on
your mental health …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having considered other factors, including the physical health of her
and her child, he referred also to what he described as “a social housing
crisis in this borough and a severe shortage of permanent accommodation
locally”, which he regarded as a “highly relevant factor” in concluding that
the offer was suitable and reasonable for her to have accepted (para 51).</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>The proceedings</b></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As already noted, Ms Poshteh appealed unsuccessfully to the County
Court. In the Court of Appeal there was a difference of view, McCombe LJ, with
whom Moore-Bick LJ agreed, held that the reviewing officer had properly
considered the relevant issues and reached a valid decision. Elias LJ held
otherwise, focussing principally on the reasoning at the “key passage” in para
45 of the letter (set out above). As he put it:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The premise is that
unless the relevant inciting stressor was one which, objectively considered, ‘was
reminiscent of a prison cell or … recreated the conditions of confinement or
incarceration’, which this property did not, the panic attacks could
effectively be ignored or at least treated as sufficiently trivial as not to be
likely to affect her mental health.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He thought this approach was flawed:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If as a matter of fact the
appellant would be likely to suffer panic or anxiety of such a nature and
degree as to create a significant risk of damaging her mental health, it
matters not whether it is an explicable or rational reaction. It would still be
reasonable for the appellant to refuse the property, as in the <i>El-Dinnaoui</i>
case. Alternatively, the officer might possibly have reasoned that absent an
objectively explicable inciting stressor, any panic or anxiety induced by the
premises would be minimal and unlikely to have an effect on the appellant’s
mental health. If so, the analysis is still in my opinion flawed because there
was no proper evidence to justify that inference. It is true that the medical
evidence was to the effect that small and dark premises, obviously reminiscent
of a prison cell, may well trigger the attacks, but that did not discount the
possibility that the attacks may occur in other circumstances. In my judgment
there was no basis for inferring simply from the nature of the inciting
stressor that the attacks could not be significant enough to damage her mental
health.” (para 51)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moore-Bick LJ summarised what he understood to be the critical
difference between the other judgments, and gave his own comment:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“62.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point on which my Lords
are divided is whether Mr Stack wrongly dismissed as objectively unreasonable
Ms Poshteh’s assertion that the round window in the living room reminded her of
her prison cell and as a result ignored her evidence of experiencing a panic
attack when she visited the property. If that were the case, I should agree
with Elias LJ that he misdirected himself. Ms Poshteh’s reaction to the round
window, as evidenced by her panic attack, was an objective fact, even if it was
irrational, and was a matter to be taken into account. However, reading para 45
as a whole in the context of the preceding paragraphs, I am not persuaded that
Mr Stack did ignore Ms Poshteh’s reaction when reaching his conclusion …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">What Mr Stack actually said was
that he did not accept as objectively reasonable her assertion that the size or
design of the windows in the living room were reminiscent of a prison cell or
that the windows or layout of the room recreated the conditions of confinement
or incarceration that were likely to have a significant impact on her mental
health. The first of those observations cannot in my view be criticised, since
the size and design of the windows were not on any objective view reminiscent
of a prison cell. Whether the windows or layout of the room recreated
conditions of confinement or incarceration that were likely to have a
significant impact on Ms Poshteh’s mental health, on the other hand, was a
matter of judgment which had to be determined by reference not only to the
nature of the inciting stressor or her perception of the property but to the
evidence as a whole …”</p>

a medically-confirmed history of anxiety due to fear of heights. They were
offered a flat on the 16th floor. She became distressed on leaving after the
inspection and collapsed at the lift, and an ambulance had to be called. The
council’s decision that this flat was suitable or reasonable for her to occupy
was held by the Court of Appeal to be perverse and so unlawful.</p>

</span>In <i>Ali v Birmingham City Council </i>the court’s conclusion that

between the class of social security and welfare benefits whose substance was

were, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgment by the relevant
authority; that cases in the latter category, where the award of services or
benefits in kind was dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments by the
provider as to whether the statutory criteria were satisfied and how the
applicant’s need ought to be met, did not amount to a ‘civil right’ within the
autonomous meaning which was given to that expression for the purposes of

<p class="ParaLevel1">The right to accommodation under section 193 was held to

</span>This was the unanimous conclusion of the court following detailed
consideration of the authorities domestic and European. The case was decided
against the background of two domestic cases, in which this or related issues
had been discussed at the highest level, but not decided: <i>Runa Begum v Tower
Hamlets London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/5.html">[2003] 2 AC 430</a> (in which the House had

(relating to a local authority decision whether or not to provide accommodation
for a child in need under section 20(1) of the Children Act 1989).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the latter case Lady Hale (with whom the other justices agreed),
found it unnecessary to reach any firm conclusions on the application of
article 6 (para 34), but, after a review of the authorities, commented that she
would be “most reluctant” to accept, unless driven by Strasbourg authority to
do so, that article 6 requires the “judicialisation of claims to welfare
services of this kind”, where “every decision about the provision of welfare
services has resource implications for the public authority providing the
service” (para 44). Concurring, but without specific agreement from the rest of
the court, Lord Hope felt that it could “now be asserted with reasonable
confidence” that the authority’s duty under section 20(1) did not give rise to
a “civil right” (para 65).</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Ali </i>itself, Lord Hope giving the leading speech (agreed by
Lady Hale and Lord Brown) noted Lord Hoffmann’s observation in <i>Runa Begum </i>(paras
42-44) that it was not in the public interest for funds allocated to social
welfare schemes to be unduly consumed in administration and legal disputes,
quoting with approval the joint dissenting opinion in <i>Feldbrugge v The
Netherlands</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/4.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 425</a>, 443, para 15:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The judicialisation of dispute
procedures, as guaranteed by article 6.1, is eminently appropriate in the realm
of relations between individuals but not necessarily so in the administrative
sphere, where organisational, social and economic considerations may
legitimately warrant dispute procedures of a less judicial and formal kind.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Lord Hope observed that the article had now been extended
to “public law rights, such as social security or other cash under publicly
funded schemes”, but that “no clearly defined stopping point to this process of
expansion” had been identified. He saw the instant case as “an opportunity to
introduce a greater degree of certainty into this area of public law” (paras
5-6).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He noted that in <i>Runa Begum </i>the House had preferred not to decide
the question, one reason being the wish not to inhibit the government from
developing the arguments in the Strasbourg court should it become necessary to
do so (para 31); the balance of advantage now pointed in the direction of
taking a decision and so ending the “unhealthy” uncertainty in the law (para
32). Reviewing the judgments in <i>Runa Begum </i>itself (paras 38-39), he
noted with approval comments by Lord Bingham that to hold this to be a civil
right would go further then Strasbourg had yet gone; by Lord Hoffmann that “the
whole scheme of Part VII was shot through with discretions …”; by Lord Millett
that, given the authority's discretion as to how it will discharge its duties
and the fact that ultimately this called for an exercise of judgement, the
claim could not be said to be for “an individual, economic right flowing from
specific rules laid down in a statute”. He reviewed the relevant authorities
since <i>Runa Begum</i>, including the <i>Croydon </i>case. Of the Strasbourg
authorities Lord Hope noted in particular <i>Tsfayo v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/981.html">[2007] BLGR 1</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1158.html">48 EHRR 18</a><i>, </i>commenting there had been no dispute that the claim
to housing benefit in that case concerned the determination of the applicant’s
civil rights:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This was not surprising, as the
case fell within the mainstream of cases such as <i>Salesi v Italy</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/14.html">26 EHRR 187</a> and <i>Mennitto v Italy</i> 34 EHRR 1122 where the issue was one as to the
entitlement to an amount of benefit that was not in the discretion of the
public authority. The case offers important guidance as to what is needed to
satisfy the requirements of article 6.1. But it takes us no further on the
question whether a statutory duty to provide benefits in kind as part of a
scheme of social welfare falls within the scope of that article.” (para 42)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">He referred to “a number of straws in the wind” in other
cases pointing the other way, and supporting a distinction between -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“... the class of social security
and welfare benefits that are of the kind exemplified by <i>Salesi v Italy</i>
 <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/14.html">26 EHRR 187</a> whose substance the domestic law defines precisely and those
benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgment
by the relevant authority.” (para 43)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">He referred for example to <i>Loiseau v France</i>
(Application No 46809/99), 18 November 2003 (unreported), para 7 where the
court had referred to “a ‘private right’ which can be said, at least on
arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law” and to “an individual
right of which the applicant may consider himself the holder”. He concluded

scheme, in which the Strasbourg court had spoken of the claim as being for “an
individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a federal
statute …” (para 65). He distinguished the content of the statutory duty under
section 193 which “lacks precision” and gave “no right to any particular
accommodation”. Such factors together with “the essentially public nature of
the duty” meant that it did not give rise to “an individual economic right”
(para 73).</p>

principled basis for the distinction between social security payments and
social welfare provision, given that both require “the expenditure of public resources”,
provide “a valuable resource to the recipient”; and “are activated by a need on
the part of the beneficiary”. He concluded however that -</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para26">“… the lack of similarity to (or,
rather, the distinction that can be made with) a private insurance scheme, and

were referred on Part VII of the 1996 Act (taken with the Children Act 2004).
That was principally concerned with the circumstances in which the authority
could reasonably make a final offer of accommodation in another area (in that
case more than an hour away from where she and her family had lived for many
years). The council’s decision was set aside on the facts of the case. However,
the court recognised the pressures facing authorities dealing with such cases,
and the range of considerations which needed to be taken into account,
including the resources available to them, the availability of accommodation in
their own areas, and the similar pressures on adjoining authorities.</p>

was held that a disciplinary decision by a prison governor to order segregation
did not engage article 6.1. Lord Reed (in a judgment agreed by the other
members of the court) referred (para 113) to the Grand Chamber judgment in <i>Boulois
v Luxembourg </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/587.html">(2012) 55 EHRR 32</a>, concerned with release on licence, in which
the court had said that for the civil limb of article 6.1 to be engaged there
must be a dispute over a “right” which “can be said, at least on arguable
grounds, to be recognised under domestic law”, adding (para 91):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The court may not create by way of
interpretation of article 6.1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in
the state concerned. The starting-point must be the provisions of the relevant
domestic law and their interpretation by the domestic courts. This court would
need strong reasons to differ from the conclusions reached by the superior
national courts by finding, contrary to their view, that there was arguably a
right recognised by domestic law.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Later in the judgment Lord Reed noted that the article had
also been applied to cases concerning rights in public law “regarded as closely
resembling rights in private law, such as rights to state benefits”. He
commented that in <i>Ali v Birmingham City Council</i> -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the critical feature of cases
in the latter category was identified as being that the benefits in question
were the subject of precise definition and could therefore amount to an
individual right of which the applicant could consider herself the holder.

on the exercise of judgment by the relevant authority. That is consistent with

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn to the judgment of the Strasbourg court. As part of the history
of the case (paras 20-24) it referred to extracts from Lord Hope’s judgment in <i>Ali
v Birmingham City Council </i>(paras 20-24), but without further discussion of
the court’s reasoning. Under a section headed “Judicial consideration of Part VII
of the Housing Act 1996” it referred to only two cases: <i>Adan v Newham London
Borough Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1916.html">[2002] 1 WLR 2120</a> CA, and <i>Runa Begum </i>in this court.<i>
</i>Of the former, the judgment noted that the Court of Appeal had set aside
the order of the County Court on jurisdictional grounds, but had gone on “in an
extended obiter dictum” to consider the effect of article 6:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this regard, Hale LJ opined
that the right to accommodation under section 193 ‘is more akin to a claim for
social security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services, where
the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations
may also be relevant’.” (para 32)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Of <i>Runa Begum</i>,<i> </i>the judgment referred to the
court’s conclusion that the review mechanism under Part VII complied with
article 6, assuming it applied. On the issue whether article 6 did apply, the
only citation was of the comments of Lord Millett (paras 91 and 93), in which
he had noted the features which took the case “beyond the existing case law”,
and which made it “inappropriate for determination by the ordinary judicial
process”; but had found it “more difficult, at least in principle, to justify
withdrawing it from the protection of article 6.1”. The court summarised the
submissions of the parties, including the submission on the part of the UK
government that the applicant had only “a general right to be housed”, not to
any specific property; this was contrasted with the provision of a financial
benefit “where both the entitlement and the amount were determined by a clear
set of conditions” (para 49).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the heading “The Court’s assessment” the judgment began by setting
out “general principles” including the need to start from the interpretation of
the relevant provisions by the domestic courts (para 54). On the application of
those principles to the facts of the case, it is appropriate to set out the
substance of the reasoning in full:</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of [<i>Runa</i>]<i>
Begum</i> the House of Lords accepted that section 193(2) of the 1996 Act
imposed a duty on the Council to secure that accommodation was available for
occupation by Ms Begum. Thus, a duty was owed which was enforceable by Ms Begum
and which related to a matter of acute concern for her. In the present case the
Council acknowledged in its letter of 7 November 2006 to the applicant that it
owed her the ‘main housing duty’ to provide accommodation to her and her family
… The Government also accept that she had a general right to be housed …
although the applicant could not point to any property to which she had any
right.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court is satisfied
that in the present case the applicant had a legally enforceable right by
virtue of section 193 of Part VII of the 1996 Act to be provided with
accommodation, albeit that this was a right that could cease to exist in
certain conditions … Moreover, the court proceedings in question clearly
concerned a ‘dispute’ over the continuing existence, if not the content, of
that right; the dispute was genuine and serious; and the result of the
proceedings was directly decisive for the right in question. It therefore falls
to the Court to decide whether or not the right in question was a ‘civil right’
for the purposes of article 6 para 1 of the Convention.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para30">58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now
well-established that disputes over entitlement to social security or welfare
benefits generally fall within the scope of article 6 para 1 of the Convention
[the footnote cites eg <i>Tsfayo v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1158.html">48 EHRR 18</a> para 40, <i>Feldbrugge
v Netherlands</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/4.html">8 EHRR 425</a>, <i>Deumeland v Germany</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/3.html">(1986) 8 EHRR 448</a> and <i>Schuler-Zgraggen
v Switzerland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/29.html">16 EHRR 405</a>]. The Court has even recognised a right to a
non-contributory welfare benefit as a civil right [citing eg <i>Salesi v Italy</i>
 <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/14.html">26 EHRR 187</a>, para 19, and <i>Tsfayo v United Kingdom</i>, para 40].
However, the present case differs from previous cases concerning welfare
assistance, as the assistance to be provided under section 193 of the 1996 Act
not only was conditional but could not be precisely defined [comparing eg <i>Tsfayo</i>,
in which the dispute concerned a fixed financial amount of housing benefit]. It
concerns, as the Government noted, a ‘benefit in kind’ and the Court must
therefore consider whether a statutory entitlement to such a benefit may be a
‘civil right’ for the purposes of article 6 para 1 …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">59.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that
accommodation is a ‘benefit in kind’ and that both the applicant’s entitlement
to it and the subsequent implementation in practice of that entitlement by the
Council were subject to an exercise of discretion. Nonetheless, the Court is
not persuaded that all or any of these factors necessarily militate against
recognition of such an entitlement as a ‘civil right’. For example, in <i>Schuler-Zgraggen
v Switzerland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1993/29.html">16 EHRR 405</a>, in which the applicant’s entitlement to an
invalidity pension depended upon a finding that she was at least 66.66%
incapacitated, the Court accepted that article 6 para 1 applied. In any case,
the ‘discretion’ in the present case had clearly defined limits: once the
initial qualifying conditions under section 193(1) had been met, pursuant to
section 206(1) the Council was required to secure that accommodation was
provided by one of three means, namely by providing accommodation itself; by
ensuring that the applicant was provided with accommodation by a third party;
or by giving the applicant such advice and assistance to ensure that suitable
accommodation was available from a third party. In this regard, the Court
agrees with Hale LJ in <i>Adan v Newham London Borough Council</i>, in which
she opined that the right to accommodation under section 193 ‘is more akin to a
claim for social security benefits than it is a claim for social or other
services, where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and
resource considerations may also be relevant’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the above, as
far as the applicability of article 6 para 1 is concerned, the Court sees no
convincing reason to distinguish between the applicant’s right to be provided
with accommodation, as acknowledged by the Council in its letter of 7 November
2006, and the right to housing benefit asserted by the applicant in <i>Tsfayo</i>.
Article 6 para 1 therefore applies and, as such, the applicant had a right to a
fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having decided that article 6 did apply, the court agreed with the
domestic courts that the procedure under Part VII was compliant,
notwithstanding that the County Court did not have “jurisdiction to conduct a
full rehearing of the facts” (para 83), but “taking as a whole the legislative
welfare scheme by virtue of which the applicant, as a homeless person, derived
her ‘civil right’ to be provided with accommodation” (para 87).</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>The review of the domestic authorities noted above, from <i>Runa Begum </i>onwards,
shows a continuing debate on this issue, against the background of the
uncertain Strasbourg jurisprudence. The unanimous judgment of this court in <i>Ali
v Birmingham City Council </i>was intended to settle the issue at domestic
level, after a full review of all the relevant Strasbourg authorities. Against
this background it is necessary to consider whether the reasoning in the recent
Chamber decision makes it necessary or appropriate for us to depart from that
decision.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Chamber acknowledged (in line with the Grand Chamber decision in <i>Boulois</i>)
the weight to be given to the interpretation of the relevant provisions by the
domestic courts. It is disappointing therefore that it failed to address in any
detail either the reasoning of the Supreme Court, or indeed its concerns over
“judicialisation” of the welfare services, and the implications for local
authority resources (see para 23 above). Instead the Chamber concentrated its
attention on two admittedly obiter statements, respectively by Hale LJ (as she
then was) in the Court of Appeal in <i>Adan</i>,<i> </i>and Lord Millett in <i>Runa
Begum</i>. However, its treatment of these two statements is open to the
criticism that they were taken out of context, and without regard to their
limited significance in the domestic case law.</a></p><a name="para33">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Adan </i>the application of article 6 had been conceded by
counsel. It is not clear that the passage quoted from the judgment of Hale LJ (para
55) was doing more than recording the basis of the concession. It is true that
the passage was mentioned with approval by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Runa Begum </i>(paras
66-69). However, her own considered view on the issue is apparent from both her
own judgment in the <i>Croydon </i>case, and her agreement with the leading
judgment in <i>Ali </i>(in which <i>Adan </i>did not merit a mention).<i> </i>Nor
is it clear from the decision that the Chamber fully appreciated the width of
the discretion given to the authority, including questions of resource
allocation (emphasised by Lady Hale herself in other cases). Lord Millett’s
comments needed to be read with the following sentence of his speech, which expressed
his view that “most European states possess limited judicial control of
administrative decisions” so that, if article 6 did not apply, such decisions
might be outside judicial control altogether (para 93). It would have been
interesting to know to what extent that perception of the inadequacies of other
administrative law systems was shared by the members of the Chamber, with the
benefit of their more direct knowledge. In any event, Lord Millett’s views on
this point were not shared by the rest of the House, and were overtaken by the
considered and unanimous view of this court in <i>Ali </i>itself.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Questionable also, with respect, is the Chamber’s reliance on the
decision in <i>Schuler-Zgraggen v Switzerland </i>as an example of entitlement
subject to “discretion”. As Lord Collins pointed out in <i>Ali </i>(at para 61),
it was treated by the 1993 court as a claim to an “individual economic right”
flowing from “specific rules” laid down in the statute. The case report shows
that the statute in question gave a right to a full invalidity pension where
incapacity of at least 66.66% was established (para 35). Once that level of
incapacity was established, the financial entitlement followed as a matter of
right, not discretion. It is hard to see any fair comparison with the range of
factors, including allocation of scare resources, to which authorities are
entitled to have regard in fulfilling their obligations under the housing
legislation. In fairness to the Chamber, it may be that this was not spelt out
in the government’s submissions, as fully as it has been in recent domestic
cases (see eg para 27 above).</a></p><a name="para35">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Our duty under the Human Rights Act 1998 section 2 is “take account of” the
decision of the court. There appears to be no relevant Grand Chamber decision
on the issue, but we would normally follow a “clear and constant line” of
chamber decisions (see <i>Manchester City Council v Pinnock </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/6.html">[2011] 2 AC 104</a>, para 48). This might perhaps be said of some of the previous decisions
referred to in the judgment, including most recently <i>Tsfayo v United Kingdom
</i>(2006) in which the application of article 6 was conceded by the
government. However, it is apparent from the Chamber’s reasoning (see para 58
cited above) that it was consciously going beyond the scope of previous cases.
In answer to Lord Hope’s concern that there was “no clearly defined stopping
point” to the process of expansion, its answer seems to have been that none was
needed. That is a possible view, but one which should not readily be adopted
without full consideration of its practical implications for the working of the
domestic regime.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scope and limits of the concept of a “civil right”, as applied to
entitlements in the field of public welfare, raise important issues as to the
interpretation of article 6, on which the views of the Chamber are unlikely to
be the last word. In my view, this is a case in which, without disrespect to
the Chamber, we should not regard its decision as a sufficient reason to depart
from the fully considered and unanimous conclusion of the court in <i>Ali</i>.
It is appropriate that we should await a full consideration by a Grand Chamber
before considering whether (and if so how) to modify our own position.</a></p><a name="para37">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn to the second issue which was the subject of decision in the
courts below. In this court Mr Westgate QC for Ms Poshteh supports the judgment
of Elias LJ. In addition he relies on the “public sector equality duty” under
section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 as underlying the “sharp focus” which
should have been given by the officer to the effects of the applicant’s
disability. For this purpose, he has subjected the decision letter to
exhaustive critical analysis. In summary he says that letter fails to explain
the link between the objective reasonableness or otherwise of Ms Poshteh’s
assertion that the round window reminded her of a prison cell, and the
rejection of her claim that it would have a significant impact on her mental
health. Nor did the letter-writer address adequately the “subjective factors”
underlying her claim. In particular he should have addressed explicitly the
panic attack suffered by her when she visited the property. This was a
subjective fact, even if (as she was said to have admitted at the interview)
the round window was not exactly like the one in her prison cell.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the appeal on this issue well illustrates the relevance of
Lord Neuberger’s warning in <i>Holmes-Moorhouse</i> (para 7 above) against
over-zealous linguistic analysis<i>. </i>This is not to diminish the importance
of the responsibility given to housing authorities and their officers by the
1996 Act, reinforced in the case of disability by the Equality Act 2010. The
length and detail of the decision-letter show that the writer was fully aware
of this responsibility. Viewed as a whole, it reads as a conscientious attempt
by a hard-pressed housing officer to cover every conceivable issue raised in
the case. He was doing so, as he said, against the background of serious
shortage of housing and overwhelming demand from other applicants, many no
doubt equally deserving. He clearly understood the potential importance of
considering her mental state against the background of her imprisonment in
Iran. His description of the central issue (para 39) has not been criticised.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that he did not in terms address her claim to have suffered a
“panic attack”. But it is hard to criticise him for giving little weight to an
incident which she had not mentioned at the time, either to the NHHG officer
who accompanied or in her initial letter, nor apparently to either of her
medical advisers. In this respect it was a very different case from <i>El-Dinnaoui</i>,
to which Elias LJ referred (para 17 above), where the effect was immediate and
obvious, and consistent with previous medical advice. Nor, on the other side,
did he hold against her her admission at interview that, whatever her reaction
during the visit, the flat would have been acceptable on a temporary basis. In
any event, the issue for him was not her immediate reaction on one short visit,
but how she would reasonably have been expected to cope with living there in
the longer term. On that he was entitled to give weight to the medical evidence
submitted by her, and to consider how far it supported her case.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Taken in isolation the first sentence of para 45 could have been better
expressed. But read in the context of the preceding paragraphs the tenor is
reasonably clear. The medical evidence was based on a false premise; the assertions
she had apparently made to them about the physical features of the property did
not match the facts. This was a point he had fairly put to her at the
interview, and she was unable to provide a convincing answer. It might well
have been unreasonable to offer her (in the clinical therapist’s words)
“accommodation with very small dark rooms without windows at a normal height
and looking out onto everyday life”. But that was not a reasonable description
of this particular property, nor a sufficient ground for her not accepting it.
Seen in that light there is no difficulty in understanding his reasoning
overall. Nor does it disclose any error of law.</a></p><a name="para41">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally I should notice Mr Westgate’s invitation to the court to address
questions related to the standard of review by the court. He developed an
elaborate argument by reference to recent authorities supporting a more
flexible approach in different contexts, particularly where “fundamental
rights” are a stake (eg <i>Pham v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/19.html">[2015] 1 WLR 1591</a>). This issue was not one on which permission to appeal was given,
nor has Mr Westgate offered any convincing reason for extending its scope. I
bear in mind also Lord Neuberger’s comments on the potentially profound
constitutional implications of a decision to replace the traditional <i>Wednesbury
</i>tests for administrative decisions in general (<i>R (Keyu) v Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/69.html">[2016] AC 1355</a>, para 132).<i> </i>I
would agree with Mr Westgate that, since the creation of a statutory right of
appeal to the county court, recourse to the highly restrictive approach adopted
30 years ago in the <i>Puhlhofer </i>case (<i>R v Hillingdon London Borough Council,
Ex p Puhlhofer</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/1.html">[1986] AC 484</a>) is no longer necessary or appropriate.
However, the principles governing the right of appeal to the county court under
the 1996 Act have been authoritatively established by the House of Lords in <i>Runa
Begum</i>’s case and others following it (including <i>Holmes-Moorhouse</i>),
and should be taken as settled.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accordingly dismiss the appeal on the second issue.</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Proliferation of authorities</b></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before leaving the case, I feel bound to say something about the volume
of authorities presented in the court bundles. UKSC Practice Direction 6 deals
with the form and content of such volumes (paras 6.5.2ff). The appellants are
responsible for production of authorities in paper form in sufficient numbers
for the court, subject in due course to the court’s decisions on costs.
Paragraph 6.5.5 states:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Court has on numerous
occasions criticised the over-proliferation of authorities. It should be
understood that not every authority that is mentioned in the parties’ printed
cases need be included in the volumes of authorities. They should include only
those cases that are likely to be referred to during the oral argument or which
are less accessible because they have not been reported in the Law Reports.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this case the court was presented with eight bundles, including more
than 90 cases, reproduced in full, together with 20 other items of statutory
material, guidance and textbook extracts (extending in total to some 2,700
pages). The intervention of the Secretary of State was accompanied by two
additional bundles, extending to more than 1,000 pages, and including 13
further authorities. The most relevant cases were helpfully, and correctly (PD6
para 6.5.2), brought together in the appellant’s volumes 1 and 2. Of the
remainder the vast majority were not referred to in oral argument, and were
unlikely on any view to be more than peripheral to the determination of the
issues on which permission had been given.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I take as an example volume 4 headed “Precedent - whether to depart from
previous/follow Europe (or not)”. This volume included no less than seven House
of Lords or Supreme Court authorities, totalling almost 350 pages. The volume
was not opened during the hearing. The propositions which the cases were
apparently intended to support were familiar, uncontentious, and adequately
summarised with appropriate citations, in the printed cases. Similarly, the
subjects covered by volume 6 (“absence of proper reasons” and “standard of
scrutiny”) can be taken as sufficiently familiar to the court not to require
extensive citation; still less the inclusion in the bundle of the whole of the <i>Wednesbury
</i>case </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html">[1948] 1 KB 223</a> (12 pages), <i>Edwards v Bairstow</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1955/3.html">[1956] AC 14</a> (26
pages) and <i>Kennedy v Charity Commission </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/20.html">[2015] AC 455</a> (107 pages).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is essential that those involved in the preparation of these bundles,
whether as counsel or solicitors, take full responsibility for keeping their
contents within reasonable bounds and exercise restraint. The warning against
proliferation of authorities is intended for the protection not just of the
court, but more for the parties on whom the costs will ultimately fall. In many
cases (as I assume in this case) they will be borne in one way or another from
public sources.</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal, and confirm the decision
of the reviewing officer.</a></p><a name="para48">
