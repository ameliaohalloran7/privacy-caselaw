</span>On 27 July 2016, following a hearing of this appeal, this court referred
a number of questions of EU law to the Court of Justice for a preliminary
ruling: <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Vomero </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/49.html">[2016] UKSC 49</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/49.html">[2017] 1 All ER 999</a>. On 17 April 2018 the Court of Justice delivered its
judgment: <i>FV (Italy) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>(Joined
Cases C-424/16 and C-316/16) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2018/C31616.html">[2019] QB 126</a>. In the light of that judgment, and
the opinion of Advocate General Szpunar, this court held a further hearing of
the appeal on 7 February 2019. It is now in a position to give its decision on
the appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The facts</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, Franco Vomero, is an Italian national born on 18
December 1957. On 3 March 1985 he moved to the United Kingdom with his future
wife, a UK national. They were married in the UK on 3 August 1985 and had five
children here, for whom Mr Vomero cared, in addition to working occasionally,
while his wife worked full-time.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 1987 and 2001 Mr Vomero received several convictions in the UK, two
of which (in 1991 and 1992) resulted in short terms of imprisonment. In 1998
the marriage broke down. Mr Vomero left the family home and moved into
accommodation with Mr Edward Mitchell.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 1 March 2001, Mr Vomero killed Mr Mitchell. Both men had been
drinking, a fight ensued and Mr Vomero struck Mr Mitchell at least 20 times on
the head with weapons including a hammer, and then strangled him with
electrical flex from an iron. Mr Vomero was arrested on 2 March 2001 and
remanded in custody until his trial. The jury reduced the charge of murder to
manslaughter by reason of provocation. Mr Vomero was on 2 May 2002 sentenced to
eight years’ imprisonment. He was released on licence on 3 July 2006 but
re-arrested a short time later as no hostel accommodation was available for him.
He was subsequently detained under immigration powers.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>By decision made on 23 March 2007 and maintained on 17 May 2007, the
appellant, the Secretary of State, determined to deport Mr Vomero under
regulations 19(3)(b) and 21 of the Immigration (European Economic Area)
Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003). Regulation 19(3)(b) permits the Secretary of
State to deport a national of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or a family
member of an EEA national, where the person’s removal is justified on the
grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Any such
deportation must be in accordance with regulation 21. The latter regulation
gives effect to articles 27 and 28 of Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April
2004 (OJ 2004 L158, p 77) (“the Directive”), which are set out below.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>Mr Vomero challenged that decision before the Asylum and Immigration
Tribunal. The decision of that tribunal was appealed to the Court of Appeal,
whose decision (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1199.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 1199</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1199.html">[2013] 1 WLR 3339</a>) has given rise to the
present appeal. The proceedings were twice adjourned pending the determination
of other cases, including latterly the references in <i>Onuekwere v</i> <i>Secretary

</span>Mr Vomero was detained with a view to deportation until December 2007.
He subsequently committed and was convicted of further offences, two of which
resulted in custodial sentences. In January 2012 he was convicted of having a
bladed article, battery and committing an offence while subject to a suspended
sentence. He was sentenced to 16 weeks’ imprisonment. In July 2012 he was
convicted of burglary and theft and was sentenced to a further 12 weeks’ imprisonment.</a></p><a name="para7">

of another member state for a period of up to three months without any
conditions or formalities other than the requirement to hold a valid identity
card or passport. Under article 7, entitled “Right of residence for more than
three months”, Union citizens have the right of residence on the territory of

</span>The Directive did not contain any transitional provisions explaining
whether the right of permanent residence could be acquired immediately on 30
April 2006 on the basis of earlier periods of legal residence, or, if so, which
earlier periods would qualify, in particular if they had been interrupted or
had ceased at some point prior to that date. Nor did the Directive contain any
provisions explaining whether periods of imprisonment might be treated as legal
residence, or whether imprisonment interrupted the continuity of residence.
Those and other lacunae have been filled by numerous judgments of the Court of
Justice.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="ParaHeading">The previous judgment of this court</p>

</span>At the previous hearing of the appeal, the Secretary of State’s case,
put shortly, was that since Mr Vomero was in prison between 2001 and 2006, he
had not acquired a right of permanent residence under article 16 by the time
the deportation order was made in March 2007. It followed that, although he
enjoyed the protection of articles 27(2) and 28(1) of the Directive, he did not
benefit from the protection against expulsion conferred by article 28(2). In
the Secretary of State’s submission it also followed, contrary to the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal, that Mr Vomero was not entitled to “enhanced
protection” against expulsion under article 28(3)(a). As presented to this
court, the Secretary of State’s case did not involve investigating events prior
to 2001, but rested on the undisputed fact of Mr Vomero’s imprisonment from
2001 to 2006.</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>Lord Mance, with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed,
observed at para 8 of his judgment that no right of permanent residence under
the Directive could in law be acquired before 30 April 2006, when the period
for transposing the Directive expired. To acquire such a right, Mr Vomero
therefore required, as at 30 April 2006 or at some later date, to “have resided
legally for a continuous period of five years” in the UK, as stipulated by
article 16(1) of the Directive: <i>Lassal</i>, para 38. As at the date when the
deportation decision was taken, Mr Vomero had completed the custodial part of
his sentence less than nine months earlier, and had entered immigration detention.
Lord Mance also noted at para 9 that in <i>Onuekwere </i>the Court of Justice
held that, under the terms of article 16(2) of the Directive, “periods of
imprisonment cannot be taken into consideration for the purposes of the
acquisition of a right of permanent residence for the purposes of that
provision” (para 22), and that articles 16(2) and (3) “must be interpreted as
meaning that continuity of residence is interrupted by periods of imprisonment
in the host member state” (para 32). Lord Mance observed that the same must
necessarily apply in respect of a Union citizen under article 16(1).</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>Lord Mance went on to refer in para 10 to the judgment of the Court of
Justice in <i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Dias</i> (Case
C-325/09) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C32509.html">[2012] All ER (EC) 199</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C32509.html">[2011] ECR I-6387</a>, which concerned a Union
citizen who had resided legally in the UK for over five years between January
1998 and April 2003 (not yet acquiring a right of permanent residence, since
the period ended before 30 April 2006), and then remained in the UK between
April 2003 and April 2004, during which time she did not work or satisfy any
other condition entitling her to reside in the UK under EU law. She then worked
in the UK between April 2004 and March 2007, at which point she asserted that
she had acquired a right of permanent residence. Lord Mance observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Court of Justice held that
the rule laid down in article 16(4) regarding absences [‘once acquired, the
right of permanent residence shall be lost only through absence from the host
member state for a period exceeding two consecutive years’] must be applied by
analogy in relation to the period when she had not been working. Since this was
for less than two years, it did not affect her acquisition of a permanent right
of residence as from 30 April 2006. The Supreme Court considers it clear … that
the Court of Justice was here identifying a bright line rule relating to the
acquisition of a permanent right of residence.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mance went on to observe at para 11 that, where a person had
acquired a right of permanent residence, “[b]y analogy with absence, it might …
seem logical if a period exceeding two years spent in prison were to lead to
the loss of any right of permanent residence acquired on or after 30 April
2006”. Lord Mance added however that the parties were not agreed on this, and
that it was unnecessary to consider the point further on the present appeal.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mance concluded at para 12:</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It follows from paras 8 and 9
above that, as the Secretary of State rightly submits, the respondent had not
acquired any right of permanent residence before the date of the decision to
deport him. The respondent’s case on this basis has to be that this is
irrelevant, and that a Union citizen with no right of permanent residence may
nevertheless acquire a right to enhanced protection under article 28(3)(a).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that regard, counsel for Mr Vomero submitted at the previous hearing
that the requirement in article 28(3)(a) that the Union citizen “have resided
in the host member state for the previous ten years” involved an overall
assessment of the degree of integration at the date of the decision to deport,
that there must “in principle” have been ten continuous years of residence, but
that a period of imprisonment immediately preceding the decision to deport
would not necessarily mean that prior integration was lost to a degree
depriving the Union citizen of enhanced protection under article 28(3)(a). That
submission had been accepted by the Court of Appeal, which noted that Mr Vomero
had resided in the UK for more than ten years prior to his imprisonment in
2001, and considered that his integrative link with the UK remained intact in

protection under article 28(3)(a) depends upon the possession of a right of

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">If the answer to question (1) is
in the negative, the following questions are also referred:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the period of
residence for the previous ten years, to which article 28(3)(a) refers, is</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple calendar
period looking back from the relevant date (here that of the decision to
deport), including in it any periods of absence or imprisonment,</p>

</span>Before answering the first question referred by this court, the Court of
Justice made the following preliminary observations:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By its first question,
the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom asks, in essence, whether article
28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that it is a
prerequisite of eligibility for the protection against expulsion provided for
in that provision that the person concerned must have a right of permanent
residence, within the meaning of article 16 and article 28(2) of that Directive.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a preliminary point,
it should be noted that that question is based on the premise that Mr Vomero
does not have such a right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the court does not
have all the information necessary in order to assess the merits of that
premise, it must be assumed, for the purposes of the question, that it is well
founded.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also relevant to note the preliminary observations made by
Advocate General Szpunar in his opinion:</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para23">“32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … [T]he national court
has stated that Mr Vomero has not acquired any right of permanent residence,
which is a matter for that court to determine before taking a final decision
with due regard to EU law as interpreted by the court. According to the
national court, that finding is based on the fact that Mr Vomero was in prison
between 2001 and 2006, as well as the approach taken by the court in its case
law, particularly in <i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Dias</i>
(Case C-325/09) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C32509.html">[2011] ECR I-6387</a>; [2012] All<i> </i>ER (EC) 199, para 57 and <i>Onuekwere’s</i>
case <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C37812.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2420</a>, para 26.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it must be
noted that, in the case of citizens of third states who fulfil the condition of
minimum presence on the employment market of a member state, namely citizens
whose rights are based on Association Council Decision No 1/80 of 19 September
1980 on the Development of the Association between the European Economic
Community and Turkey, the court has held that their right of residence, as the
corollary of the right to have access to the employment market, is not affected
by imprisonment: see <i>Cetinkaya v Land Baden-Wȕrttemberg</i> (Case
C-467/02) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C46702.html">[2004] ECR I-10895</a>, paras 38 and 39 and <i>Aydinli v Land
Baden-Wȕrttemberg</i> (Case C-373/03) [2005] ECR I-6181, para 32. (In the
context of pre-trial detention followed by a criminal sentence of suspended
imprisonment, also see <i>Nazli v Stadt Nȕrnberg </i>(Case C-340/97)
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2000/C34097.html">[2000] ECR I-957</a>, paras 40 and 41.) In taking that approach, the court referred
to the wording of the provisions of that Decision, which does not permit any
limitation on the right of residence except in the event of absence or on
grounds of public policy, public security or public health: <i>Cetinkaya’s</i>
case, para 38 and <i>Aydinli’s</i> case, para 28. However, in <i>Dias’s</i>
case, para 64, the court held that a similar provision of Directive 2004/38,
namely article 16(4), may be applied by analogy to periods prior to those
covered by Directive 2004/38 which do not amount to legal residence for the
purpose of article 16(1) of that Directive: <i>Dias’s</i> case, para 65. In <i>Dias’s</i>
case the court sought above all to address a lacuna in Directive 2004/38 and a
situation which could arise only prior to that Directive: see opinion of
Advocate General Trstenjak in <i>Dias’s</i> case EU:C:2011:86; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C32509.html">[2011] ECR I-6387</a>, point 102. The case law cited above concerns the effect of imprisonment
on the enjoyment of rights acquired after presence on the employment market for
a number of years, while <i>Onuekwere’s</i> case, relates to the stage at which
a right is acquired. Consequently, the main reason stated by the court in <i>Onuekwere’s</i>
case, para 26, according to which the taking into consideration of periods of
imprisonment for the purpose of acquiring a right of permanent residence would
be contrary to the aim pursued by Directive 2004/38, cannot be applied to the
case of forfeiture of that right because, in some cases, it may involve a Union
citizen taking advantage not of periods of imprisonment directly, but of
earlier periods of residence in the member state.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

their significance.</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="ParaHeading">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court’s answer to the first question</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice began its consideration of the first question
referred to it by explaining that article 28 provides a graduated scheme of
protection against expulsion, under which the degree of protection reflects the
degree of integration of the Union citizen concerned in the host member state:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … Directive 2004/38, as
is apparent from recital (24) in the Preamble, establishes a system of
protection against expulsion measures which is based on the degree of
integration of those persons in the host member state, so that the greater the
degree of integration of Union citizens and their family members in the host
member state, the greater the guarantees against expulsion they enjoy.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that context, first
of all, article 28(1) of Directive 2004/38 provides generally that, before
taking an expulsion decision ‘on grounds of public policy or public security’,
the host member state must take account in particular of considerations such as
how long the individual concerned has resided on its territory, his or her age,
state of health, family and economic situation, social and cultural integration
into the host member state and the extent of his or her links with the country
of origin …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, under article
28(2), Union citizens or their family members, irrespective of nationality, who
have the right of permanent residence on the territory of the host member state
pursuant to article 16 of the Directive cannot be the subject of an expulsion
decision ‘except on serious grounds of public policy or public security’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, in the case of
Union citizens who have resided in the host member state for the previous ten
years, article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 considerably strengthens their
protection against expulsion by providing that such a measure may not be taken
except where the decision is based on ‘imperative grounds of public security, as
defined by member states’ …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It thus follows from the
wording and the structure of article 28 of Directive 2004/38 that the
protection against expulsion provided for in that provision gradually increases
in proportion to the degree of integration of the Union citizen concerned in
the host member state.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those circumstances,
and even though it is not specified in the wording of the provisions concerned,
the enhanced protection provided for in article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38
is available to a Union citizen only in so far as he first satisfies the
eligibility condition for the protection referred to in article 28(2) of that
Directive, namely having a right of permanent residence under article 16 of
that Directive.” (citations omitted)</p>

</span>The Court of Justice accordingly concluded at para 61 that the answer to
the first question was “that article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must be
interpreted as meaning that it is a prerequisite of eligibility for the
protection against expulsion provided for in that provision that the person
concerned must have a right of permanent residence within the meaning of
article 16 and article 28(2) of that Directive”. It followed that the second
and third questions referred by this court did not require to be examined.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span>The Court of Justice joined the reference made by this court with
another reference made by a German court, in the case of <i>B v Land
Baden-Wȕrttemberg </i>(Case C-316/16, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2018/C31616.html">EU:C:2018:256</a>), which raised related questions. It
is relevant to note some passages in the court’s judgment in which it
considered the fourth question referred to it by the German court, which it
described as being “in essence, at what point in time compliance with the
condition of having ‘resided in the host member state for the previous ten
years’, within the meaning of article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38, must be assessed”:
para 84.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer to that question was that whether a person satisfied that
condition must be assessed at the date on which the expulsion decision is initially
adopted. However, the court added the following remarks:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“89.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be noted,
however, that that conclusion is without prejudice to the separate issue of
when it is necessary to assess whether there are actually ‘grounds of public
policy or public security’ within the meaning of article 28(1) of Directive
2004/38, ‘serious grounds of public policy or public security’ within the
meaning of article 28(2) of that Directive, or ‘imperative grounds of public
security’ within the meaning of article 28(3) of that Directive, on the basis
of which expulsion may be justified.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, it is
indeed for the authority which initially adopts the expulsion decision to make
that assessment, at the time it adopts that decision, in accordance with the substantive
rules laid down in articles 27 and 28 of Directive 2004/38.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that does not
preclude the possibility that, where the actual enforcement of that decision is
deferred for a certain period of time, it may be necessary to carry out a fresh,
updated assessment of whether there are still ‘grounds of public policy or
public security’, ‘serious grounds of public policy or public security’ or
‘imperative grounds of public security’, as applicable.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be borne in
mind, in particular, that under the second sub-paragraph of article 27(2) of
Directive 2004/38, the issue of any expulsion measure is, in general,
conditional on the requirement that the conduct of the person concerned must
represent a genuine, present threat affecting one of the fundamental interests
of society or of the host member state …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, it follows,
more generally, from the case law of the court that the national courts must
take into consideration, in reviewing the lawfulness of an expulsion measure
taken against a national of another member state, factual matters which
occurred after the final decision of the competent authorities which may point
to the cessation or the substantial diminution of the present threat which the
conduct of the person concerned constitutes to the requirements of public
policy or public security. That is so, above all, if a lengthy period has
elapsed between the date of the expulsion order and that of the review of that
decision by the competent court …” (citations omitted)</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The parties’ submissions</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the light of the preliminary observations of the Court of Justice and
the Advocate General, an issue has arisen between the parties as to whether it
is open to Mr Vomero to argue that he had acquired a right of permanent
residence in the UK by the date of the decision to deport him. In the
submissions advanced on behalf of Mr Vomero, the argument is couched in terms
of whether he “retained” a right of permanent residence which was “notionally,
though not formally” acquired prior to 30 April 2006. It is argued on his
behalf, under reference to cases concerned with actual, not notional, rights of
permanent residence, that a period of more than two years’ imprisonment need
not result in the loss of such a right. A similar argument was presented on
behalf of Mr Vomero to the Court of Justice, but was not reflected in the
approach which it adopted. As it seems to me, references to a “notional” right
of permanent residence are liable to obscure the true question. There is no
indication in the judgments of the Court of Justice that EU law recognises a
right of permanent residence of a merely “notional” character. On the contrary,
the judgments of the Court of Justice in the cases concerning the Directive
have drawn a distinction between the acquisition of a right of permanent
residence (as in <i>Lassal, Dias </i>and <i>Onuekwere</i>) and the subsequent
loss of such a right (as provided for under article 16(4) of the Directive).
Before any question can arise as to whether Mr Vomero retained a right of
permanent residence, it is necessary first to determine whether he had acquired
such a right, not “notionally” but in reality: something which, as the Court of
Justice has made clear (for example, in <i>Dias</i>, paras 40 and 57), could
only occur on or after 30 April 2006.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As explained earlier, Lord Mance concluded in his judgment that Mr
Vomero had not acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK by the date of
the decision to deport him, notwithstanding his many years’ residence, because
his imprisonment between 2001 and 2006 had the result that he had not, as at 30
April 2006 or some later date, resided legally in the UK for a continuous
period of five years prior to the decision to deport him.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is argued on Mr Vomero’s behalf that this reasoning cannot be
correct, given the Court of Justice’s statement in para 42 of its judgment
(cited at para 22 above) that it did not have all the information necessary in
order to assess the merits of the premise of the first question referred,
namely, as the court stated in para 41, “that Mr Vomero does not have such a
right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom”. Since, it is argued, the
court had Lord Mance’s judgment before it, it cannot have found in Lord Mance’s
reasoning a sufficient basis for his conclusion.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In response, the Secretary of State submits that the conclusion
expressed in para 12 of Lord Mance’s judgment is correct. He concedes, however,
that when the appeal is remitted to the Upper Tribunal to be reconsidered, it
will be open to Mr Vomero to argue, if he can establish it on the evidence,
that he has acquired a right of permanent residence since the date of the
decision to deport him, and therefore now benefits from the protection given by
article 28(2) of the Directive. The parties agree that that is because the
tribunal is required under domestic law to consider the position as at the date
of the hearing before it, rather than the date of the decision under challenge.
This is agreed to follow from section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and
Asylum Act 2002, together with Schedule 2, paragraph 1 of the Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052). Given that that is a
matter of agreement, this court need express no view as to whether it is
legally correct.</a></p><a name="para32">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

</span>The preliminary observations made by the Court of Justice do not set out
any criticism of the reasoning which led Lord Mance to the conclusion stated in
para 12 of his judgment. The court properly confined itself to answering the
question referred to it. It is notable that the premise which the court said
that it was unable to assess was not the same as Lord Mance’s conclusion. That
conclusion was that “the respondent had not acquired any right of permanent
residence before the date of the decision to deport him”: that is to say, that
he had not acquired such a right by 23 March 2007. The premise which the court
assumed to underlie the reference was different: “that Mr Vomero does not have
such a right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom”: that is to say,
that he does not presently have such a right. This court expressed no view as
to whether Mr Vomero presently has such a right. That question was not, and is
not, before this court. As explained in para 32 above, the parties are in
agreement that the question whether Mr Vomero has acquired a right of permanent
residence since 23 March 2007 remains open for consideration by the tribunal
when the case is remitted there. The Court of Justice’s observation that it did
not have all the information necessary in order to assess whether Mr Vomero
(presently) has a right of permanent residence does not, therefore, undermine
Lord Mance’s conclusion to any extent.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The preliminary observations of the Advocate General also began at point
32 (cited at para 23 above) by attributing to this court a statement that “Mr
Vomero <i>has not</i> acquired any right of permanent residence” (emphasis
supplied): a statement which, however, this court did not make. The Advocate
General’s belief that this court had made such a statement may form the
background to part of what he said in point 33.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that paragraph, the Advocate General began by referring to the
approach adopted by the Court of Justice in the cases of <i>Cetinkaya</i> and <i>Aydinli</i>,
which were not concerned with the Directive but with the effect of imprisonment
on rights of residence acquired under Decision 1/80 of the EEC-Turkey
Association Council of 19 September 1980. The Advocate General contrasted that
approach with the approach adopted in the case of <i>Dias</i>, concerned with
the acquisition of the right of permanent residence under the Directive. He
explained the latter approach as being designed to address a lacuna in the
Directive. In this passage, the Advocate General appears to have intended to
clarify the case law of the Court of Justice, or possibly to invite the court
to do so. In the event, the Court of Justice did not comment on the matter: its
judgment contains no mention of <i>Cetinkaya</i> or <i>Aydinli</i>, and
mentioned <i>Dias </i>only to record that this court had referred to it.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Advocate General then went on in point 33<i> </i>to contrast <i>Cetinkaya
</i>and <i>Aydinli</i>, which as previously mentioned concerned the effect of
imprisonment on the enjoyment of rights previously acquired, with the case of <i>Onuekwere</i>,
which concerned the effect of imprisonment on the acquisition of a right of
permanent residence. He expressed the view that the reasoning in <i>Onuekwere</i>
could not be applied to cases concerned with the forfeiture of that right once
acquired. That passage in his opinion is relevant to para 11 of Lord Mance’s
judgment (cited at para 18 above), where Lord Mance observed, obiter, that it
might seem logical if a period of more than two years’ imprisonment were to
lead to the loss of a right of permanent residence once acquired. It does not,
on the other hand, affect the reasoning which led Lord Mance to his conclusion
in para 12.</a></p><a name="para36">

</span>The preliminary observations of the Advocate General do not, therefore,
place in question Lord Mance’s conclusion in para 12 of his judgment that Mr
Vomero had not acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK by the date of
the decision that he should be deported. That conclusion follows, as Lord Mance
explained, from the principles laid down in the judgments of the Court of
Justice in <i>Dias </i>and <i>Onuekwere</i>.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>The case of <i>Dias</i>, like the present case, concerned a situation
where a Union citizen had been legally resident in the UK for a continuous
period of more than five years prior to 30 April 2006: as explained earlier,
she resided legally in the UK between January 1998 and April 2003. That period
of continuous legal residence had, however, been followed by a period between
April 2003 and April 2004 when she was not legally resident, since she did not
work or satisfy any other condition entitling her to reside in the UK under the
Directive, although she remained in possession of a residence permit issued under
Council Directive 68/360/EEC. She then worked in the UK between April 2004 and
March 2007, at which point she asserted that she had acquired a right of
permanent residence.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>The Court of Justice held<i>, </i>following its judgment in the case of <i>Lassal</i>,
that continuous periods of five years’ legal residence which were completed
before 30 April 2006 counted towards the acquisition of the right of permanent
residence, but that the right could not be acquired until that date. It then
referred to article 16(4) of the Directive, under which the right of permanent
residence, once acquired, is lost through absence from the host member state
for a period exceeding two consecutive years. Although that provision is
concerned with the loss of the right of permanent residence, rather than with
its acquisition, and although it is concerned only with absence from the host
member state, the Court of Justice held that the rule which it laid down had
also to be applied by analogy, in the context of the acquisition of a right of
permanent residence, to periods spent in the host member state during which the
conditions governing entitlement to a right of residence were not satisfied,
which occurred before 30 April 2006 and after a continuous period of five
years’ legal residence completed prior to that date.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>In that regard, the court stated:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the court has also
held that that provision [article 16(4)] falls to be applied independently of
whether the periods of residence in question were completed before or after 30
April 2006, for the reason that, since residence periods of five years
completed before that date must be taken into account for the purpose of
acquisition of the right of permanent residence provided for in article 16(1)
of Directive 2004/38, non-application of article 16(4) thereof to those periods
would mean that the member states would be required to grant that right of
permanent residence even in cases of prolonged absences which call into
question the link between the person concerned and the host member state (see <i>Lassal’s</i>
case (para 56)).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">62.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such reasoning must also
be applied by analogy to periods of residence completed on the basis solely of
a residence permit validly issued pursuant to Directive 68/360, without the
conditions governing entitlement to any right of residence having been
satisfied, which occurred before 30 April 2006 but after a continuous period of
five years’ legal residence completed prior to that date.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">63.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though article
16(4) of Directive 2004/38 refers only to absences from the host member state,
the integration link between the person concerned and that member state is also
called into question in the case of a citizen who, while having resided legally
for a continuous period of five years, then decides to remain in that member
state without having a right of residence.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, it
should be noted, as the Advocate General has stated in points 106 and 107 of her
opinion, that the integration objective which lies behind the acquisition of
the right of permanent residence laid down in article 16(1) of Directive
2004/38 is based not only on territorial and time factors but also on
qualitative elements, relating to the level of integration in the host member
state.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the situations are
comparable, it follows that the rule laid down in article 16(4) of Directive
2004/38 must also be applied by analogy to periods in the host member state
completed on the basis solely of a residence permit validly issued under
Directive 68/360, without the conditions governing entitlement to a right of
residence of any kind having been satisfied, which occurred before 30 April
2006 and after a continuous period of five years’ legal residence completed
prior to that date.”</p>

</span>The case of <i>Dias </i>was concerned with a period, following a
continuous period of five years’ legal residence completed prior to 30 April
2006, during which the conditions of legal residence were not satisfied because
the Union citizen was out of work. The case of <i>Lassal </i>was concerned with
a period, following a continuous period of five years’ legal residence
completed prior to 30 April 2006, during which those conditions were not
satisfied because the Union citizen was absent from the host member state. The
present case is concerned with a period, following a continuous period of five
years’ legal residence completed prior to 30 April 2006, during which the Union
citizen was in prison.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The leading authority on the significance of imprisonment in relation to
the acquisition of a right of permanent residence is the case of <i>Onuekwere</i>.
It concerned a Nigerian national who became the husband of a Union citizen
exercising her right of residence in the UK. The question was whether he had
acquired a right of permanent residence under article 16(2) of the Directive
(see para 10 above). In order to do so, he had to have resided legally with his
wife in the UK for a continuous period of five years. He resided with her
legally between 2000 and 2004, but was then in prison between September 2004
and November 2005. He was imprisoned again between 2008 and 2009. He then
asserted that he had acquired a right of permanent residence. The court held
that the periods of imprisonment could not be taken into account for the
purpose of calculating the length of the claimant’s residence in the UK. It
stated at para 26:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The imposition of a prison
sentence by the national court is such as to show the non-compliance by the
person concerned with the values expressed by the society of the host member
state in its criminal law, with the result that <i>the taking into
consideration of periods of imprisonment for the purposes of the acquisition by
family members of a Union citizen who are not nationals of a member state of
the right of permanent residence for the purposes of article 16(2) of Directive
2004/38 would clearly be contrary to the aim pursued by that directive</i> in
establishing that right of residence.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The court went on to state at para 32 that article 16(2)
and (3) must be interpreted as meaning that continuity of residence is
interrupted by periods of imprisonment in the host member state of a
third-country national who is a family member of a Union citizen. The practical
result was that Mr Onuekwere was unable to aggregate the periods of residence
before and after his periods of imprisonment, so as to establish a period of
five years’ continuous legal residence.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onuekwere </i>differs from <i>Lassal</i> and <i>Dias</i>
in that the decision was not based on the application by analogy of the rule in
article 16(4) of the Directive, under which a right of permanent residence,
once acquired, is lost where there has been a period of absence exceeding two
consecutive years. Instead, it was based on the application of article 16(3),
which concerns continuity of residence for the purpose of the acquisition of a
right of permanent residence, and was interpreted as applying where there has
been a period of imprisonment, as well as in the cases expressly set out in
that provision. The reasoning in <i>Onuekwere </i>nevertheless resembles that
in<i> Lassal </i>and <i>Dias</i>, in that it was based (as appears, for
example, from paras 24-25 and 30) on the significance of imprisonment in
relation to the integrative link between the offender and the host member
state.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Lord Mance observed in para 9 of his judgment,
the same reasoning as was applied in <i>Onuekwere</i> for the purposes of
article 16(2) of the Directive (which applies article 16(1) to the family
members of a Union citizen who are not themselves nationals of a member state)
and article 16(3) (which applies for the purposes of both article 16(1) and
article 16(2)) must also apply to Union citizens themselves for the purposes of
article 16(1).</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present case differs from <i>Onuekwere</i>, however,
in that Mr Vomero had completed more than five years’ continuous legal
residence in the UK before he was imprisoned in 2001. Considering whether Mr
Vomero had acquired a right of permanent residence when the period for
implementation of the Directive expired on 30 April 2006, the position is
therefore analogous to those in <i>Lassal</i> and <i>Dias</i>: the rule in
article 16(4) has to be applied by analogy. Treating imprisonment as weakening
the integrative link between the person involved and the host member state in a
similar way to the circumstances in <i>Lassal </i>and <i>Dias</i>, in
accordance with the judgment in <i>Onuekwere</i>, it follows that the period of
imprisonment for more than two years which Mr Vomero had undergone by 30 April
2006 prevented him from acquiring a right of permanent residence on that date,
or at any subsequent time prior to 23 March 2007, when the decision to deport
him was taken. The necessary period of five years’ continuous legal residence
could not begin any earlier than 3 July 2006, when he completed the custodial
part of his sentence, and would depend on his fulfilling the conditions for
legal residence laid down in the Directive. If five years’ continuous legal
residence had not been completed by the time of the periods of imprisonment in
2012, those periods would not count towards the five years required, and would
interrupt the continuity of residence, in accordance with <i>Onuekwere</i>.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Mance’s conclusion that Mr Vomero had not
acquired a right of permanent residence by the date of the decision to deport
him was therefore correct. On the other hand, a question is raised by the
Advocate General’s comments in the last two sentences of point 33 of his
opinion in the present case in relation to the tentative suggestion made by
Lord Mance in the penultimate sentence of para 11 of his judgment. As explained
earlier, Lord Mance observed, obiter, that it might seem logical if a period of
more than two years’ imprisonment were to lead to the loss of a right of
permanent residence once acquired. The Advocate General, however, expressed the
view that the reasoning in <i>Onuekwere </i>could not be applied to cases
concerned with the forfeiture of that right once acquired. In the light of those
comments, it would be wise for this court to refrain from expressing any view
in the present case as to whether there may be a distinction between the effect
of imprisonment on the acquisition of a right of permanent residence, with
which <i>Onuekwere</i> was concerned, and its effect on the retention of such a
right once obtained.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as the Court of Justice made clear in
paras 89-94 of its judgment in the case of <i>B v Land Baden-Wȕrttemberg</i>,
cited at para 28 above, it will be necessary for the tribunal, when this case
is remitted to it, to consider not only whether Mr Vomero has acquired a right
of permanent residence since the date of the decision to deport him, in
accordance with the agreement of the parties (see para 32 above), and if so the
implications of his having done so, but in any event whether there are still
“grounds of public policy or public security” within the meaning of article
28(1) of the Directive on the basis of which his expulsion may be justified.</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons, the court should in my
view allow the appeal, grant a declaration that neither article 28(2) nor
article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38/EC applied to Mr Vomero as at the date of
the Secretary of State’s decision to deport him on 23 March 2007, and remit the
respondent’s appeal against that decision to the Upper Tribunal to be
reconsidered in accordance with this judgment.</a></p><a name="para48">
